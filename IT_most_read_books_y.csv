Fourth Wing (The Empyrean, #1)
",Rebecca Yarros,4.57,2232835,8981,"Dragons, Romantasy, Fiction, Audiobook, Fantasy Romance, Magic, New Adult",517,02-05-2023,"Enter the brutal and elite world of a war college for dragon riders...Twenty-year-old Violet Sorrengail was supposed to enter the Scribe Quadrant, living a quiet life among books and history. Now, the commanding general—also known as her tough-as-talons mother—has ordered Violet to join the hundreds of candidates striving to become the elite of Navarre:dragon riders.But when you’re smaller than everyone else and your body is brittle, death is only a heartbeat away...because dragons don’t bond to “fragile” humans. They incinerate them.With fewer dragons willing to bond than cadets, most would kill Violet to better their own chances of success. The rest would kill her just for being her mother’s daughter—like Xaden Riorson, the most powerful and ruthless wingleader in the Riders Quadrant.She’ll need every edge her wits can give her just to see the next sunrise.Yet, with every day that passes, the war outside grows more deadly, the kingdom's protective wards are failing, and the death toll continues to rise. Even worse, Violet begins to suspect leadership is hiding a terrible secret.Friends, enemies, lovers. Everyone at Basgiath War College has an agenda—because once you enter, there are only two ways out:graduate or die","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""#3 Reread - November 2023 - ೃ⁀➷ 5 starsFourth wing(noun) my favourite hello and my hardest goodbye…*#2 Reread - August 2023 - ೃ⁀➷ 5+ stars. . . Mrs Yarros, hmu if u run out of creative ways to carry out dainty boys death trope, I’ve got some amazing ideas. I’ll do u and everyone proud <333Also everything from my first review still stands 😌👑Also pt.2, yes. . . Yes, the ending still hurtWORSEthe second time around 🥰🥰🔫🔫─── ⋆⋅☆⋅⋆ ──#𝟭 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗱 - 𝗠𝗮𝘆 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟯 - ೃ⁀➷ 𝟱 𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘀TO ANYONE LISTENING YOU NEED TO GO INTO THIS BOOK AS BLIND AS POSSIBLE I PROMISE ITS GONNA ENHANCE THE EXPERIENCE TENFOLD. ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW IS THAT THIS WILL BE YOUR NEW FAV BOOK FOREVER <3But for everyone else who needs to know…Here’s a quick rundown of the book:it’s about the daughter of a high-ranked general, Violet, getting ordered into learning how to become a dragon rider (but she doesn’t initially want to bc all she’s known are books her entire life) and so she commits to basgiath War collage where she goes through trials designed to root out the weak. She has to figure out how to best everyone and weaponise her strengths. While navigating her feelings for a certain forbidden boi. There’s romance AND (back arching) spice with sparks and tension galore. Also for everyone wondering, the ending isn’t that bad. It’s more of a promising cliffhanger. Makes you feel hopeful rather than making you want to crash and burn everything in your line of sight lmao.*I’m sorry in advance bc this review is gonna be gigantisaourus*wags brows* do you see what I did there?It’s been ages since I’ve loved all the MCs in a book so I deserve to go crazy on the fangirling, leave me alone 🙏This book. THIS BOOK- It gives you EVERYTHING you crave in romantasy. The drama, the characters, the plot, the action, the betrayal, the romance, the tension, THE HOPE THAT THERE ARE STILL AMAZING BOOKS OUT THERE IN THE WORLD-AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER-There is not a single dry page. Not one. It constantly stimulates your imagination. And there aren’t the usual boring unnecessary bs conversations happening, they’re almost always full of banter and in every chapter, something is happening. It’s fast-paced and that’s something I ADORE about this book.BUT CAN WE ACKNOWLEDGE THE FUCKING TENSION PLS??The addictive chemistry between XadenVi will chew you up, eat you alive and then shit you out, effectively altering the composition of your DNA forevermore😩❤️\u200d🩹The dialogue in this book is so yummy istg I was always giggling and kicking my feet whenever the MCs would interact 🤭💗🦋 they’re both sarcastic funny smart and complement each other sm. I’m telling you this book never left me wanting for anything. There was never a time when I was like ugh the MCs hardly interact or wtv. There’s a perfect amount of every aspect in this book, I’ll never be able to get over it.While reading, it leaves you feeling as though you’ve lost a limb whenever you have to remove yourself from the book to carry out the most trivial inconvenience like feeding and hydrating yourself 😤🔪I'm telling you this book is the only sustenance I need to keep me alive 🙏Violet is me. I am Violet. We are one.No bc she is the most relatable character I’ve read in a long ass time. The way she is so reasonable, empathetic and HAS INTEGRITY. She’s not a pushover. She knows her mind and isn’t afraid to speak it when she feels the need to. There’s no ‘my body is betraying me’ bullshit. Not in this house. I’m in LOVE with violet sfmmm. She owns her feelings and demands what she’s owed. And when Xaden challenges her but she takes it as an incentive to poke and tease him back tenfold is ✨💗🦋🤌Watching her grow and become stronger was one of the most satisfying things about this book. Her character development was elite. She never changed her morals but she always adapts and moves on quickly and I cannot stress enough hm I love that about her.There wasn’t a single moment where I was annoyed at her for being hardheaded. She’s strategic but also carefree. She behaved like a normal 20-year-old would, not older/younger.XADEN is such a seductive menace but he’s MY precious seductive menace.He's always up for a challenge and he SERVES every freaking time. I love everything he has to say. He’s such a lil softy when it comes down to it. Him showing his love through his actions and constantly challenging Vi to do better??It’s the way he never coddles her but also shaves years off his life, worrying about her safety for me 🥹💗🙏😩🦋💞✨🧸I’m always waiting on hands and feet for any interaction with him whether it be his glares 🤭theirnot so shortglances across the classroom 💞his sarcastic quips 💅him being a brooding surly grump😩him being lethally calm 👑him obsessed with her every move 🙏💗Him telling her not to look at him like that bc he only has sm restraint??🤌❤️\u200d🔥 (I have to note that Lance did it better sksksksk) BUT EVERYTHING HE DOES IS HOT PLS-The way I fell for him the first moment he was described?? Everyone is saying how he’s like this guy or that guy from this book and that and I’m just here like idc if he was an amalgamation of every MMC I love?? I DONT CARE BECAUSEIT MADE ME LOVE HIM EVEN MORE👏 I respect Rebecca for plucking the best traits of every fantasy MMC, like don’t be shy put some more 💀✋And there are the dragons but all you need to know is that each one has their personality. They rule themselves. They're the real legends here. And the way this author has weaved them into the book is just MWAH *chefs kiss*The found family in this book is the most precious thing ever.I loved to read how they’re bonded together and I can see that each relationship has the potential to grow into something really special ugh I cannot wait for the next books 😩OkaySPOILERS ahead!!bc your girl gotta scream <33---When Tairn came out of wherever tf he was hiding I was screaming and legit shaking from the adrenaline. I’m still having a hard time accepting how good this book is! I thought she would only get Andarna and I was kinda disappointed bc the moment Tairn got mentioned in that lesson I JUMPED ON THE IDEA OF HIM SO FAST YOU DONT UNDERSTAND. But when he came to save her and Goldie AND THEN SPOKE TO HER IN HER MIND?? I BROKE DOWN AND HOWLED. SO. FUCKING. LOUD.And then Andarna was like “TELL HER MY NAME AS WELL” and I’m- *passes out from yelling so much*I LOVE ANDARNA SFMMM SHES THE MOST ADORABLE CUTE LITTLE SUNSHINE IVE EVER HAD THE PLEASURE TO READ ABOUT 🥹🫂💗😫💞🧸 The light of my life I’m telling you. she must be protected at all costs. (But omg at the end Xaden was like Goldie’s gone huge and I’m here like oop- I NEED TO SEE HER RFN)I love how Tairn is a dad adjacent to Violet 🙏 he’s my grumpiest overprotective pookie 🤭💗with STRONG feelings for his mate skskdhjd (I’m kinda jelly of Sgaeyl ngl)ALSO HOW FUCKING DARE YOU REBECCA!! You ripped my heart out of my chest, gave it a thousand paper cuts and flung it into a volcano for good measure. Liam's death BROKE me🔪 I cried too many fat ugly tears 😭 it was unbearable *shaky breath* but when XADEN found out and cried the cry of all cries?!? Me: (;´༎ຶٹ༎ຶ`) X 100And the fact that her brother is alive made me do a lap around my garden from sheer satisfaction bc I WAS FUCKING RIGHT. 15% in I guessed that he would be alive but he’ll be part of the “wrong” side of the war and it’s been kept a secret bc of the shame/treason and AHHH *does cheerleader flip and cartwheel*And Dain?? That pussy ass lil BITCHHHH- I wasn’t born with enough middle fingers to let you know hm I feel about him. He’s basically Adam from shatter me, and fml bc my reread is just gonna be me wanting to rip his spine out and strangling him w it whenever he speaks 😃🔫But when that inntinnsic called his every thought out to the crowd it was the most hilarious shit ever pls 💀 he’s so pathetic.SPOILERS OVEROne thing I have to say is that this book is not perfect. The action aspect of the book gets a LOT better towards the end imo but the start was a little rusty and needed some finesse but idc idc I’ll take it, faults and all. After all, I’m a character development lover so I can overlook it.BUT THE WORLD BUILDING IS- ヽ(♡‿♡)ノOml the way this author writes leaves you ON THE EDGE WHITE KNUCKLING YOUR SEAT GASPING SHAKING SCREAMING bc you have no idea what will happen next.IT'S THE BIGGEST FLEX TO NOT ONLY OUTDO THE OGS BUT TO EXCEL PHENOMENALLYYYYY AT IT AS WELL 💅✨REBECCA YAROS YOU ARE AN ICON BC I GOBBLED UP EVERY SCENE EVERY CHAPTER EVERY WORD.𝗦𝗶𝗱𝗲 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗲:I think it’s become my favourite fantasy book ever.

Not once did it feel boring or like I should just skim something, and for once, I know the hype was so worth it! 😩• Spoilers ahead — and I seriously want y\'all to enjoy this book without spoilersThis book is the perfect blend of Fantasy-Romance because it had the spiciest romance scenes with lots of sexual tension and enough twists that will keep you awake the whole night.*Dark circles forming, but anything for XadenVi.*❝The weak don’t survive here, especially not in the Riders Quadrant. The dragons make sure of that.❞In the beginning, Karen aka General Sorrengail, forces Violet to join Rider\'s Quadrant, a place where people become riders and form bonds with dragons.This is in contrast to Violet\'s original plan of following her father\'s path and becoming a scribe, responsible for documenting history. This makes her feeling angry and fearful because the decision is up to her mother, and she has no choice but to agree. She wasn\'t mentally or physically prepared for this challenge and have to do anything to survive.╰┈➤ VIOLET SORRENGAIL AKA VIOLENCE:❝You look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?❞Despite dealing with a chronic illness (ehler\'s danlos syndrome) and having weak joints, she was incredibly awesome and strong! Her personality was so relatable that I felt connected right away.Her anxieties and fears during challenges in the rider\'s quadrant, and how she conquered them with her smarts, were truly inspiring. She showed that knowledge is real power! Her rollercoaster of emotions—fear, anger, desire, happiness—kept me amazed.Even when teased and called weak, she never let anyone walk all over her. And fr, I didn\'t even get that \'oh I\'m so tiny and frail\' or the \'pick me vibes\' as mentioned somewhere because she actually had a illness.I would\'ve dashed for the hills (or the scribe quadrant in Violet\'s situation) when every single cadet was dead set on killing me!It was like half luck, and 25% thanks to the dragon scale corset, and another 25% to Violet\'s intelligence that kept her alive!And - wait XADEN PROTECTED HER WELL TOO! 🤭❝What I lack in strength, I make up for in speed.❞— She kept training and had a lot of improvement and her skills with the daggers were impeccable! landing straight on the target.╰┈➤ XADEN RIORSON:❝Stay the hell away from Xaden Riorson.❞Fantasy men are just FINE AF! From the beginning, he exudes a mysterious aura. Despite the stern lines on his face and a SCAR ON HIS LEFT BROW 🥵, he exudes both danger and allure.His character captivates me so deeply that even if I hadn\'t known he was the mmc, I would have rooted for him.fuck Dain.Xaden comes across as grumpy and ruthless, concealing his emotions behind a stoic facade.However, his interactions with Violet reveal a thoughtful, kind, and trusting side that filled me with so many emotions. It\'s this side of him that I adore. 💞He holds the position of the wing leader of FOURTH WING with great authority. His intelligence and power are remarkable, and don\'t even get me started on the way he walks, talks, and smirks – it leaves me utterly on my knees for him!🧎\u200d♀️His character possesses incredible depth, and I would\'ve loved to have his POV.He\'s a shadow wielder, and just by imagining the shadows around him, his rebellion relic, and his scar — I feel something inside of me! 😮\u200d💨REBECCA ADDED EVERY QUALITY TO MAKE HIM THE HOTTEST CHARACTER! 🤭— Ruthless who? He\'s such a softie....🔪 gave Violet training for sparring matches.🔪 made a saddle for her to be seated on her dragon.🔪 made a custom dagger for her.🔪 killed a room full of cadets who tried to kill Violet, just by using his shadows.🔪 took care of her when she was hurt.🔪 punished a wing leader who tried to kill Violet.╰┈➤ DRAGONS:—So the most sarcasticpersoncreature award goes to TAIRN!🫡God, how much I loved this grumpy broody dragon! He was one of the deadliest and strongest dragons, and he was bonded with none other than Violet! 🤭 His remarks were so sarcastic and savage, and the way he always scoffed and knew about her feelings for Xaden. Hehehe, and he also adores Sgaeyl sm!If he were actually a human, he\'d be so grumpy and possessive, I\'M TELLING YA\'LL! 😂💕❝And to think, I’d almost forgotten just how loquacious humans are.❞Andarna:This cutie goldie dragon—OMF, she was such a cutie! I loved how optimistic and innocent she actually was and possessed great powers, but she was only 2 years old! And the fact that she\'s also bonded with Violet 🥺Sgaeyl:We didn\'t get much about her, though hopefully in the next book, but I\'m so glad she and Tairn are bonded mates! GOD SHE HAS A BRILLIANT TASTE IN MEN. 🥵— ENEMIES TO LOVERS WHERE HE WANTS TO KILL HER? *Sign me up*❝He’s a third-year, and he will kill you the second he finds out who you are.❞Xaden is the son of Fen Riorson, known as THE GREATEST TRAITOR due to his leadership in a rebellion group. Sadly, this resulted in the execution of all rebel group members in front of their children, who were then marked with a relic symbolizing the rebellion.These children were forcibly placed into the Rider\'s Quadrant, where they faced the challenge of survival. The overseeing figure during these executions was none other than General Sorrengail (Violet\'s mother),so they\'re enemies, and he\'s the one who\'s gonnakillhandle her.🤭The enemies-to-lovers approach in this book was really well done.It felt very realistic and stayed true to the idea that \'children shouldn\'t be punished for their parents\' mistakes.\' The kids marked by the relic understood this, and Violet did too. What I especially liked was how Xaden and Violet\'s relationship grew naturally without being burdened by guilt from their pasts.Even though they weren\'t enemies for very long, the book didn\'t rush their journey to becoming lovers. Instead, it skillfully portrayed the gradual development of trust, as well as their decision to let go of their desires, leading them to eventually fall in love. ♥️Violet was super confused by Xaden\'s behavior. Rather than harming her, he encouraged her and saw her potential. He treated her as strong, not fragile, which both confused and intrigued her. 😉❝Going for blood today, are we, Violence?❞After Threshing (where the cadets were bonded with dragons), Violet discovered that Tairn, her dragon, was actually the bonded mate of Sgaeyl, Xaden\'s dragon. This connection tied the four of them together, and if one of them died, they all would. This meant Xaden couldn\'t consider killing her anymore, (not that he had intended to in the first place.) 🥹THE SEXUAL TENSION WAS TENSIONING.🥵 The sexual tension between them was incredibly strong! The heated lust-filled stares, locking eyes, proximity on mats, and more, yet neither wanted to act on it. Their first kiss was incredibly passionate and I was so giddy at that time. There were 3 graphic scenes but Damn they were HOT AF! 🫣🔥❝I am annoyingly aware of everything you do.❞NOT THEM SHATTERING WINDOWS, BREAKING ARMOIRES AND CHAIRS, BURNING CURTAINS AND FORESTS WHILE DOING ✨IT✨.╰┈➤ SIDE CHARACTERS:Rhiannon and Rodic:They were literal babies and I loved how both of them supported Violet! Idk when and how Rodic made his place in my heart but he was so cute. Always adopting humor for every situation and was so calm hehe! 🥺 Am I the only one who wants them together?Like who Tara, Sawyer, or whatever his name is, just give Rhi and Rodic.Sawyer, Imogen, Bodhi, Garrick, Emery, Heaton:I loved how they all became a squad and clearly I would love more of them!Mira Sorrengail:This badass cutie, sexy hot, I love her! 🥵 She\'s so fierce and the best sister ever! 💞Liam Mairi:WE WERE ROBBED OF HIM. I WILL NEVER EVER FORGET HIM, please he was so precious. 🥺😭 I literally cried so much when he died! I already had a feeling that he might die, but god it was so painful. I was so badly hurt when he died. It was so painful to see him dying and then Xaden calling him Brother. My heart broke! I\'m never forgetting that piece of shit Dain.Dain Aetos:This bitch, this traitor, this asshole, what the fuck! Why did he have to go and pull a full traitor-Adam-Kent behavior like bitch fuck off??I actually reasoned with him in the start and ignored him because he was just there to discourage Violet and gaslight her again and again by using \'best friend\' but he so skillfully and fucked-uply betrayed her.IF HE DIDN\'T READ VIOLET\'S MEMORIES (by touching her face) and then not telling his father, LIAM WOULD BE FUCKING ALIVE. FUCK OFF, DAINNN. I WISH YOU GET SCORCHED BY TAIRN! 🤢❝Stop. Fucking. Coddling. Her.❞— yeah, bitch, get that!Jack Barlowe:He was a piece of shit just like Dain and I\'m glad he was Violet\'s first kill, haha served him right! I don\'t want to give him more importance; he was shit AF! His death was so satisfying 😗🤝🏻Long-haired Luca and Traitor Tynan getting scorched was the best thing.General Sorrengail:I dislike her already and I know I\'ll loathe her in the next books, but the only good thing was she trusted that Violet is capable of becoming a rider.Syrena (Flier):She\'s a gryphon rider and had only 2 scenes, but I wish we get to see her in the next books!— some other things:1. I literally choked on my laugh when I read about how smartly Violet won all the sparring matches because she poisoned every player with different types of herbs during the match, and her choosing the breakfast duties to add the poisons in their lunch was such a badass move!It\'s truly proven by Violet that knowledge is power.2. When Dylan died, my heart just stopped for a moment, and I was so horrified when Aurelie died! (Guess I\'m just going to grieve for Liam baby now.)3.All the challenges gave me Squid Game vibes, like all those tasks just to survive and so many deaths each day!Ugh, It was so fun yet horrifying to read. 🤧4.""Fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.”— these beautiful words!!?? 🤭5. I seriously don\'t even understand how Violet blocked the pain out and got so many stitches every month! I\'d already be on my deathbed 😂6. Am I the only one who couldn\'t — even after reading 3 times — imagine the GAUNTLET scene???? like WTH WAS THAT 😭7.MY TOXIC TRAIT IS THAT I THINK I WOULD\'VE KILLED THE VENIN IF I WERE IN VIOLET\'S PLACE (wth? 💀💀)8. I had doubts about Venins and Wyvern from the start, and gosh, they were horrifying AF!If we want anything to be real, IT\'S FICTIONAL MEN, not these ew!9. GOD, THE END? I\'m still shocked 🥲whjwhsha, I love this book! Ayyayayayaya 🥺 TO MY READING SLUMP.... here I come!!!⤷Ratings.𖥔 ݁ ˖• Fourth Wing — 5 stars• Iron Flame– 3.75 stars• Onyx Storm– tbr'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Edit: for those who do not read the whole review but still feel they are entitled to leave a comment. This is a long review1- it dissects a lot in the book, if this is not a clue for you that there are spoilers then maybe check your IQ.2- For those who are saying ""make it short"" you know you could scrol by and not read right? just take your own advice especially if you love this book and move along to the millions of 5 star reviews3- STOP SAYING NOTHING IS ORIGINAL..I can slap you with at least 20 books written in 2923/2024 that has more originality than this book! We are not asking for a Tolkein level of originality, but if you cannot even come up with your own character description and had to take the literal description from other books (among others) then why are you even called an author?4- in a world that is coming soon to be drowned with AI movies and clips and pictures, I do not want to read an AI book. and I do not mean that the author used AI (Although at this point no one knows), I mean the copy, paste, and stitch from other booksother than that, knock yourself outThe sad reality is this book will probably be GR best fantasy of 2023 though it has NOTHING of the fantasy elementsIf I wanted to read cheap immitation of every other fantasy book then this book it is 😡😡😡😡every time I have an atom of hope that there is something 0.0000001% original, someone casually points out that it\'s not!IMPORTANT NOTE FOR READERS AT THE ENDIs this the future of books? writers shamelessly taking others\' work without even bringing their own to the table and the unknowing masses cheering them on!by now, this has become a game of ""SPOT THE COMMON, AND FIND THE DIFFERENCE""this book does not deserve an ounce of respect and this came after confirming that even the main characters\' descriptions are literally takenPLEASE STOP SAYING THAT NOTHING IS ORIGINAL ANYMORE! YEAH? PROVE ITAND EVEN IF THIS IS TRUE, IF A WRITER FAILS TO BRING AT LEAST 20% ORGININALITY ONTO THEIR BOOK, DO THEY DESERVE TO BE CALLED WRITERS???It is one thing to sample an idea or concept from ""a book"", it is another to take the whole storyline and plot from ""a book"" or in this case ""books"" and make it your own.This book is a memory quiltMade from old stuff to look newIt takes everything that we know as familiar, comfort and nostalgic and weave it together to present it as something new giving you a FAKE sense of enjoymentLet\'s imagine that I am a new reader or someone who never reads fantasy or someone who hasn\'tread and loved the other books mentioned down 👇🏻 I would have absolutely adored this book and considered it one of the best Adult fantasy this year because I knew nothing of them.And surprise surprise! This is what is happeningbut ignorance is not an excuse!Just because you haven\'t read it does not mean it is OK for this book to copy everything!starting this book, I liked that the characters were older than 18. As much as I enjoy YA, sometimes the age just throws me off! However, they still acted like a bunch of 16 and 17 yr.the lingo itself was so cringeimage:I read many YA characters more mature than the main characters in this bookread Ageless and Warda\'s one 1 star review of this book to understand where these characters went wrongThis book attempted to give us a badass female lead that understands that she is flawed, and recognizes her physical incompetence, but does not give a shit. She knows her worth and trusts her intelligence to be her biggest asset so she uses it to get what she wants. She is unapologetic. She knows that if she can’t be cunning, it\'s her life on the line. “I’ll never get over how quickly people move on around here, how callously death is swept under a rug and trampled on minutes later”but, personally, this failed. Because Violet was the typical ""I am weak in the body but somehow I can wip all your asses and accomplish anything"". She is supposed to have a sort of chronic pain that renders her in the disabled category. This is not said out loud in the book. You have to guess it yourself if you are not familiar with the symptoms or learn it from social media. So, it was a role-eye for me seeing her winning every challenge by cheating (which I accepted at first because she was disadvantaged) but then we get no information on how she trained and made herself stronger!. so what was the point of giving her a disability if we cannot see how she overcame it? Also, It was annoying at times seeing Violet practically throwing herself at Xaden like “Pick me, choose me, love me, fuck me”. Girl! Have some dignity. But who can blame her, X is hot and has""Shadow hands, iykyk.... looking at you ACOTAR and ToG fans""and let’s not forget the dragons! I mean who doesn’t love dragons? Throw in dragons with personalities who can hold a conversation and you get yourself a winnerBut these bastards decided with their ever Holly wisdom that a person with a mental disorder (look up Aboulomania) or with a bit of a bitchy attitude is weak and should be scorched to deathI am not going to touch on the characters more than that. Others have explained in detailed reviews the problems with the main leads.And the world building? Excuse me! What world building! If you can answer one question that\'s been nagging me (from the book, not theories) then I\'ll shut up about itA dragon without its rider is a tragedy.\xa0A rider without their dragon is dead.Why? Why is it this way?However, there is abig issuethat is nagging at me and making feel like I am sitting on the most comfortable sofa in the world but someone has put a cushion full of needles at my back. Every time I get a little bit relaxed, a needle pricks my spine or neck or back arm.THIS BOOK HAS NOTHING ORIGINAL AND I DARE ANYONE TO PROVE OTHERWISEWhat this book did is take several old famous ideas from other books and movies, weave it together, and the author simply tailored them with spray edges and a catching cover for bait to come up with a supposedly new book that would please young readers mostly. to quote my friend: ""This book scratches an itchand boy! did this strategy work!This did not sit well with me because :One: the author did not just take from one or two books, she took from several.Two: these ideas were not just inspiration or sampling, in many parts were almost literalThree: copying and sampling are OK as long as the book brings it\'s own added plot or storyline which in this case, Fourth Wing did notWhen I was annotating this book, I marked each time I found an almost literal resemblance to other books. (yellow marks the number)So lets begin (and I am keeping the best or worst to last)Let me begin with the main characters descriptionNo, this is not Violet Sorringale. This is Mare Barrow from Red Queen series. Brown and silver hair and lightning powerAnd the whole ""assumed dead brother who is resurrected and turns out he joined the rebellion""YeahIt\'s like FW has this weird fixation on this seriesbut Violet braids her hair you say! you know who else has silver braided hair and dragons?and how about this one?no this is not Xaden Riorsonthis is either the tall dark and all powerful Rhysand and his Shadow power (and Rhys sacrificed himself for his people, Xaden did as well)or the tall dark and handsome Dorian and his shadow handsBut Xaden has a scar on his face, near his eye more precisely! You know who else tall dark and handsome with an eye scar and rhymes with Xaden!Meadows baby! Our last name is MeadowsNo!? OK, here\'s another tall dark and handsome with scars and is always surrounded by showdows and his name starts with Az and ends with ""are you for real?!""Now, here\'s a trivia for youLet\'s count the number of books where if the guy has Shadow powers the girl gets a control over lighteningJust off the top of my headRed QueenShadow and BonesThe Shadow of Lightening .. etc.Now the plotline1-\tHarry Potter: not talking about magic systems and dragons because many books have those, but “the cadets are thrown into “four wings” upon their arrival, they have to study and compete by gaining “points” and showing skills both physically and mentally.. The literal taking was from p 313 when there is a“tournament”where they had to“retrieve a stolen treasure”to“earn 60 points”2-\tDivergent: I knew that this book was marketed as a combination of Divergent meets Game of Thrones I think, but it took the inspiration too far. I don’t want to read a cheap imitation of Divergent which this book had. The cadets are distributed into quadrants (factions). Violet ends up in the Riders (Dauntless) quadrant where if you show any sign of weakness you are either killed by a fellow cadet or scorched by a dragon!And the Tris/Four moment between Violet and Xaden is also hard to miss. She has a parent/sibling issue, he has a daddy issue. She fantasizes about him all the time (which is nauseating and untasteful at times). Him beating her ass and showing her that he hates her and maybe wants to kill her then ending up saving her life and training her. Even the knife-throwing scene was taken. And it goes on and on3-\tThe Hunger Games: this whole book was the Hunger Games – Dragon Edition. The cadets are literally allowed to kill each other even under the watchful eyes of their superiors. But that is not surprising when the professors so simply snap a cadet’s neck infront of others. I guess “the odds are always stacked against them” yep! This was in the book!And since they are at war and need soldiers, what better way to show how desperate they are than killing off their cadets, instead of sending them off to the other houses 🙄🙄4-\tShatter me/ACOTAR: What are these two series famous for? You guessed it. The predictable love triangle where the first love interest turns out to be a douche and the heroine ends up falling for the dark morally grey character. This is really starting to sound repetitive and obvious.5-\tThrone of Glass (Empire of Storms): Dorian Havilliard has Phantom hands and Xaden has Shadow hands! Both can lift and hold anything with these “hands” and use them during intimate moments. In the beach scene, Aelin and Rowan’s passion fuses their power together and lose control. Same with Vi and X6-\tMulan: (yep! The animation) Mulan shows her strength and proves herself to her camp by using her wit to climb the pole using the weights instead of carrying them to retrieve the arrow and later they use their belts to climb the columns of the palace. The same move Violet uses by planting the rope around the shaft to climb it.7-\tHow to train your dragon: from the description of the dragons, to the lowering of the eyes when meeting one, to the Hiccup and Toothless moment, and the big scarry dragon and the small golden cute one, you cant help noticing these similarities when reading this bookBUT HERE ARE THE MOST OBVIOUS COPY CAT ISSUES8- The plot conflict of the book is the same as Game of ThronesSo instead of the seven kingdoms, Navarre is divided into six but with the province in the east makes it seven! To protect itself, Navarre has built a WARD (wall) around its borders to stop an enemy that we later learn about. This enemy is ruled by a Sage (night king) who creates these venin, monsters that are destroyed only by a special material (valerian steel) which the cadets are forging into blades!people inside the kingdom think that those creatures are just folklore. Venins have the ability to make dragon-like creatures, wyverns, that can breathe BLUE FIRE and dies immediately if their creator diesimage:And the h that has the baddest dragon has silver hair which is always in a braid🙄and thought at first to be fragile and weak!9- Dragon Riders of Pern and Eragon (edited,) I originally related it to Eragon but many friends pointed out that the whole concept of dragon riders bonding with the chosen dragon and that such a dragon can mentally communicate with its rider through witty conversations and big personality is from the mother of all Dragon stories - the Dragonriders of Pern by Anne McCafferyEven the scene where V and X feel horney bec of the Dragon lust is definitely not original to The Fourth Wing10- Dragon School: Just when you think that having Voilet be a Female main lead with a disability is something original of this book, you find out it is not! Dragon School is an acclaimed YA book series by K.L Wilson published in 2017 about sixteen-year-old Amel who joins the Dominion Dragon Riders. But Amel has not only a crippled leg but also chronic disease and Dragon School training is grueling. Before she can even become an initiate, she must complete her First Flight on a dragon. Everyone around Amel thinks she will die before her first ride because of her fragile state and disability. SOUNDS FAMILIAR?Bonus courtesy of @Soyas.ReadingpalaceThis is the map of the Fourth WingThis is the map of the Witcher booksnotice anything?so, there is nothing original about this bookYou want to take the characters\' descriptions? fineoh, you want to take also the plot conflict? finewhat? you want also all the famous plotlines?BUTWhat are you bringing to the table then?????Another side issue that bugged me which was the queer representation. What representation??? I didn’t see any! A representation is when you have a character or a couple of them who are queer. This book made it out as if everyone is Bi and that it is natural for everyone to jump into bed from man to woman. If this is everyone, then this is the norm of the society in the book and there is no representation.I think that this book would be enjoyed by a person who hasn’t read the above-mentioned books or doesn’t want to read them so you get to read a mash-up of them.

She should stay away from him, but a fire burns between these two that is bound to consume them both. \u2060\u2060With stakes this high, every day could be her last.

Mark my words, this is the next big romantasy series!The writing is easy to digest, the world-building is fascinating, the heroine is an underdog and total badass, and the romance develops at a believable pace and is scorching! I laughed. I cried. And I fell in love. This book will forever live in my head rent-free! \u2060Violet Sorrengail is a secret badass!I LOVE her!!!!! She’s a twenty-year-old bookworm who’s expected to live a life as a scribe but now must survive and become a dragon rider. Physically, she’s smaller and frailer than the other cadets in the quadrant, but that doesn’t make her weak. Her mind is her strength and what she needs to survive. I love how Violet handles her situation with courage and grace and how she creates meaningful relationships at the risk of her own heart. She’s extremely relatable, and I can’t wait to see how she grows.Xaden Riorson...this man has easily become one of my top book boyfriends of all time!The son of a traitor, he’s out for revenge against Violet, whose mother led to his father\'s death. From a distance, he’s a scary, scarred, intense anti-hero, but deep down, he’s a man who is loyal, caring, and wise. And the way this man obsesses with Violet….damn. You truly don’t know if he wants to kill or f*ck her, probably both, but yeah, it’s hot! The things I would let this man do to me. 🥵The enemies-to-lovers romance was perfect, with an intense slow burn and eventually spice!I appreciated the time it took for these two to finally get together. And when they finally do, it’s explosive! Thank goodness this is new adult fantasy because the things Xaden says and did go straight to my core, lol.The dragons stole my heart.I don’t want to say too much because it would spoil some of the books, but they are terrifying and amazing!!! They have their own hierarchy and politics, which we don’t see much of since they’re very secretive, but it’s fascinating how they decide to bond with humans to create a symbiotic relationship that ultimately helps protect the land. Can\'t wait to learn more about them in the next book!The found family aspect was done so well!As a dragon rider, you\'re encouraged not to form strong attachments since most people in your school will either die before becoming riders or later on during battle. But Violet goes against this and finds her ride or dies - specifically Rhiannon and Liam! 💕The world building so easy to understand yet very interesting.I’ve never actually read a series focused on dragons and dragon riders, so this was new and exciting for me! It was so interesting learning about the different quadrants - scribe, rider, healer, and infantry - and the schooling required for each. Obviously, this story focuses more on the Riders Quadrant, which honestly is the most exciting because it\'s so intense, challenging, and cutthroat. I personally don’t know if I’d survive, but maybe if I had a friend like Violet, it would be possible!PS: For all you Manon and Abraxos fans out there, you’re going to fall in love with this world!!!For the most part, the story was a bit predictable, but it’s all done in a way that I was entertained and excited to keep reading!I mean, we\'ve seen similar stories where the seemingly weak heroine finds herself in a kill-or-be-killed situation and has to learn to fight and ultimately ends up thriving. So in that regard, you can guess where the story is heading.HOWEVER . . .That ENDING was everything I was not expecting!Those last 50 pages were absolutely epic and blew my fucking mind!!!!!! I DID NOT see that ending coming! I cried and then was left stunned by that last sentence. It\'s a cliffhanger, but it\'ll leave you more in shock instead of in pain, so don\'t be afraid of it! It\'s brutal and will make you want to immediately pick up the next book. Luckily we don\'t have to wait for long since the release date is November 7, 2023!But with everything I love, there are a few things I didn\'t like . . .Sometimes, the wording Violet used to concerning Xaden was a bit repetitive and immature.She kept describing him as beautiful and hot anytime he crossed her mind or showed up. I wish she would have used other words from time to time.The reader has to essentially piece together why Xaden falls for Violet.It’s quickly explained later in the story, but by then, it felt like we were being told more than shown. I would have liked for him to verbalize it more during the story. At least, more than him just saying things like “I can’t stay away from you”or “you’ll be the f*cking death of me”. Every time he\'s say those things, I was like, tell me why, though!Overall, Fourth Wing is an epic story that you will devour! I wouldn’t say this is a perfect 5-star read, maybe it’s closer to 4.5 since it wasn’t ‘perfect’, but honestly, I don\'t care. I haven’t read a fantasy I felt this way about in a long time, so I\'m giving it all the stars.Thank you, Entangled Publishing, for sending me an arc copy in exchange for a review.

I can\'t humanely comprehend how this has a higher rating than Six of Crows. I just can\'t. Here are the things I agree with that everyone has been saying:Good idea,fucking awful, god awful execution.And a little bit of a Shadow and Bone rip off if you ask me.She is supposed to be a scribe. She is forced to become a rider, she gets there, her childhood best friends who has always had feelings for her is mad that she is there, and worried that she won\'t survive. But don\'t worry, because theSHADOW WIELDERbad boy who hates her is there to train her and teach her all about that world. Oh and by the end she ends up being aLIGHTENING WIELDER. There hasn\'t been one in centuries.May the sun summoner bless you Fourth Wing, you\'re about to getroasted.Let\'s get the disability rep talk out of the way, many people told me there was some. And even if there is, the author approached the subject so so so subtlely I honestly couldn\'t even tell it was there. Because the only thing that was actually written was:I am so tiny, I am so weak, I am so fragile, frail, I will crumble. Please, don\'t send me to the dragon riding academy, because I am ramen noodle and I will break and die. Have I also mentioned I am white, pale, and very very very very thin? By the way, I am tiny. I am so smoll. I can\'t even jump on the dragon\'s back I am so small.How will she ever survive?I feel like for people who don’t know that specific disability, she doesn’t give you any insight? Like what does it mean? How does it happen? What is it called? As someone who had never heard of it before it was hard to even notice when she was talking about the disability. It didn’t bring any kind of awareness (which I’d think would be the whole point)Also someone who is this breakable can’t be having wild fucking sex but apparently we forgot about her disability during the sex scenes lmao.But it doesn’t matter because no matter what, everyone wanted to kill her and THERE WAS NO WAY SHE WOULD EVER SURVIVEIn this place where apparently people die daily, like flies. So much danger, so much death, so much struggle. That you don\'t see. You just hear about it because the author got too lazy to actually do any world building. So for the first half of the book there is just a bunch of telling and no showing.But don\'t worry, this frail, little pale, white girl, with white hair will bond not ONE BUT TWO of the rarest most powerful dragons alive. Even if she\'s not even tall enough to jump on their back.Also, enemies to lovers? Where? Where the fuck was that? These two have less chemistry than a priest with a hooker. Her mom is responsible for the death of someone in his family, so he blames her, he wants to kill her, he hates her from the momen the sees her (it lasts about two pages). But every time SHE SEES him, all she can think of is:""He\'s a shark and everyone next to him is a fish"", Dammit I don\'t want to find this asshole hot, but he\'s so hot"", "" ""omg, he calls me violence intead of violet, I am not attracted to toxic men but why do I want to bounce on his dick sooooooooooo bad...""So she basically sounds like a 14 year old valley girl for the entire book.They barely have any significant encounters, all of their interactions are so cringe that it makes me think this book should have been published in 2001. He smells like citrus, he has 107 scars on his back. And he tells her she\'s going to be the death of him every time he gets a chance.""He\'s a very dangerous addiction. Something women will kill for. ""If you catch me killing for men, please, end me first.Anyways, of course we have the most recycled sex dialogue on the plannet.OH GODS - WHICH GOD ARE YOU CALLING OUT FOR ITS JUST ME HERE AND I DONT SHAREThey fall deeply in love with each other, even though they barely interacted throughout the book, barely created a connection and didn\'t even hate each other at all for longer than a couple of pages. She bonds with the most powerful dragons alive, one of her dragons is mated to HIS DRAGON, and every time the dragons get horny SO DO THEY. So they have to learn how to control the hornyness coming from the dragons wanting to fuck.I wish I was joking.The book ends with avery predictable cliffhanger (which is a rip off from Red Queen and Divergent)and now this is one of the best selling books in the world.Watchu gonna do.I guess there is something out there for everyone. Part of me thinks that most people got paid really well to love this book so much. But that would be disingenuous of me to say, because I know people who didn\'t get paid who enjoyed it. So I guess I can see that this book might feel nostalgic.It gives you all the 2001 writing cringe fest, so if you missed reading something like Twilight, you\'ll definitely have fun. The characters are as childish as Zodiac Academy characters, so if you enjoy that, you might have a good time. She steals elements from Harry Potter, Shadow and Bone (most of the plot actually) ACOTAR, and used the writing style and sex scene lines most booktok people love, soBOOM! Best-Seller.Anyways, I am finally fucking free. I think I have learned my lesson and I willl chill on the booktok recommendations for a LONG LONG LONG TIME.She just ""borrowed"" SO FREAKING MUCH from many other popular series that this feels so unoriginal. It almost feels like she threw this book into an AI and said: write me a YA novel and the AI grabbed all the most popular series and put it in there. The sex scenes are all repetitive and recycled. It reads like YA, but it has none of the good aspects from YA, there’s too much sexual content that adds nothing to the plot (and this is supposed to be a fantasy series) So yeah, it\'s a no from me. Too bad as well because the dragons were cool.UPDATE:I was literally going through my old Throne of Glass highlights and found ANOTHER series this author ripped off. Aelin says she wakes up everyday and tells herself she will not be afraid. Guess who does that too in this series? 🤣'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""”there is no me without you.”I. NEED. THE. NEXT.

AM. OBSESSED. WITH. THIS. BOOK.fourth wing had a great mixture between romance and high stakes, this story was giving me major divergent and the hunger games vibes like when i tell you the vibes where there, THEY WERE THERE. it had everything i loved (and dragons) - i haven’t felt this excited about a fantasy book in MONTHS but this was captivating and now i feel a reading slump coming bc of it lmao rip to me. this is a book that is really easy to get into, it’s very fast paced and was engaging right from the beginning to the very end, I WAS HOOKED!! this lives up to the massive hype it’s getting, i get it now.. i could have read this in a day, but i needed to slow it down and savour this book.➳ i found the fantasy and world building easy to understand (there are no dumb info dumps) - so this book is perfect for those who are new to reading fantasy; yarros takes what most other books only manage to allude to and truly brings depth to her story which brings it to life. i got hooked with the whole fantasy war school, quadrants and politics setting. this is a book i want to live in, i want to jump into the pages and never leave!!➳ i understand now when people say it was very predictable bc i guessed that ending from page 1 - however, i would much rather have a predictable book than one that makes no sense bc it is trying to confuse the reader w so much unnecessary shit added into it. this was done in a perfect way.”you look all frail and breakable, but you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”↳violetis probably one of the most incredible FMCs i have read about in a while. i loved her tight bond w her sister, her dragons and the love she has for books. she’s tough, very strong willed, quick witted and not afraid to go the extra mile to succeed. she works through each challenge that is thrown at her by using her strengths and knowledge, and proves she belongs just like everyone else. i loved reading about her journey, seeing her exceed all expectations and break down every barrier she succumbed.— there is an disability representation with the fmc (she has a chronic illness) and the author done an amazing job at showing how her chronic illness doesn’t define her. i love how she shows everyone she is not some frail weakling that constantly needs to be protected.*cough* dain *cough*↳xadenis first introduced as the most powerful wing leader violet is warned to STAY AWAY from. violet had this superstition that he is out to kill her bc her mother had his father executed. but from the get go, we all know as an audience he doesn’t want to kill her, he was so smitten for violet right from the start. that man had weapons custom made for violet that would fit her body type, built a harness for andarna that clips onto tairn just so she could ride along with them and also literally made a saddle for violet to use on tairn so she doesn’t fall off while riding!! i can’t explain how much i love this man and his grumpy exterior but deep down he’s a big softy for those he loves. I JUST LOVE MEN WHO SHOW THEIR LOVE THROUGH ACTIONS!!— i will take no slander on him EVER. he is that typical broody, morally grey love interest ppl roll their eyes over, but he has DEPTH. this man fr had me kicking my feet in the air, giggling and screaming into my pillow whenever he would call violet “violence” 🤭 he is exactly what vi needed!! i just love how he always believed in her and only wants to see her at her full potential and succeed.the romance:oh my goddd, the romance was perfect!! 😮\u200d💨🤌🏼the slow burn?was burning, absolutely delicious.enemies to lovers?SPLENDID, BEAUTIFUL, EXECUTED PERFECTLY. i was itching for xaden and vi sm.the spice?DELECTABLE.

I’m trying to stop reading TikTok popular books, but the rating in this book made me picked it up. Fourth Wing was my first book by Rebecca Yarros, so I didn\'t know what exactly to expect, but at least now I know that it will be my first and last story by this author, because it turned out not to be for me.This review probably won\'t cover all the things I didn\'t like about it, as I started skipping pages after about sixty percent of the book. But without further ado, let\'s finally get to the point of my review—what exactly didn\'t work out for me in this story.The story didn’t hooked me up from the beginning at all. The main reason for this is probably because the writing style didn\'t speak out to me. I actually dnfed it the day before, because of that reason, but decided to give it another chance because I thought it might not be my day for it or maybe I wasn\'t in the right mood after a whole week. At one point I was even glad about this decision, but my enthusiasm didn’t last long. I have to be honest and say that around forty percent of the book I was pretty invested in the story when the dragons finally showed up. Unfortunately, it turned out I was only interested when the dragons were involved. The rest was just boring for me.The second thing is that I felt no connection to the characters. Literally nothing. I must admit that Violet had some great moments, but most of the time I was just embarrassed by her actions. The example.“Glad to see our year apart hasn’t dulled your tongue, Vi.”“Oh,” I toss over my shoulder as we walk into the hallway, “I can do quite a few things with my tongue. You’d be impressed.”That line sounded like a horny frat boy.Also, if you didn’t get it that she was short and tiny, the author kept reminding you of that, because that information was indeed very important.""I’m too short.""“So she’s small.” Mom scans me up and down""""Good gods, I don’t even reach his collarbone.""""I’m shorter than most.""“You’re pretty small for a rider, but it looks like you made it.”""I’m at a disadvantage, that I’m too small to climb its foreleg and mount,""“You’re tiny.” He says it like an insult""""I’m the smallest of our squad""“I’m too short for the ramp,” I whisper to Rhi.""“I’m too short to span the distance!” I hiss, uncaring that anyone could hear us.""\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200eThat\'s only from twenty-six percent of the book. I did not include the rest, because I would not have enough space for the rest of my review.Moving to Xaden—aka, your typical fantasy hero. Seriously. He was your usual tall, black haired, with strong sharp jaw, muscled body, but this time he was riding dragons. I almost forgot, he was""Flaming hot. Scorching hot. Gets-you-into-trouble-and-you-like-it level of hot.""you get the picture. He was also tall. I\'ve written about it before, but we\'ve also been reminded of it a lot. I had to mention that sentence he said here, because I was laughing my ass off at that moment.""You have incredibly touchable skin.”Touchable skin? What does it mean buddy?Honestly, the dragons were more interesting than the main characters here. If the book was about Tairn, I\'d probably be more eager to read it. This dragon had better personality than both of them. At least for me. Tairn was literally my favorite character here. That says a lot about how much I enjoyed this book.The last thing is the romance between Xaden and Violet. This series is supposed to have five books and they already done the deed, are in love—probably because I didn\'t make it to this part, and have a strong connection—again, probably because I didn\'t make it to this part. I thought that at least their first meeting, which is usually quite important, will be more spectacular. But, no. They met in the fourth percent of the book and I was like""Well, that’s it? Already?"". They were supposed to be enemies to lovers, the reasoning behind it made even sense, but they deliverednothing.I felt no chemistry between them, no tension, especially the sexual one, and no hatred that they should feel towards each other as enemies. Almost every time Violet saw Xaden it went like that.""I hate him so much""\u200e \u200e \u200e\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e""But he is so sexy and beautiful and sexy. And tall.""Not even their first kiss and the cute nickname the hero usually gives the heroine saved them. The first kiss happened after Violet found out that they could feel when their dragons banged.Yes, they could feel their dragons banging.This information made me feel quite uncomfortable. Extremely even. I know they could get rid of that with some magic or whatever, but just why? The nickname ""Violence"" that Xaden called Violet was tacky and the book could easily have survived without it. Not to mention this line.""you’re really a violent little thing, aren’t you?”My only thought wasFrom Blood and Ash. It sounds damn similar. Even though I only read the first book from this series.Moving forward to the things I liked.The dragons.Ending my review, all I will say is that I am pretty sad and disappointed that I didn’t end up liking this book. I wanted to start a new fantasy series that I would be obsessed with, but I guess we can\'t have everything we want. I’m happy for people who loved it though. Good for you guys.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'If I had a million dollars for every cliche in this book, of which there are a multitude, I\'d still regret spending $20 on all 498 pages of this mess.Spoilers to follow :)Let\'s start with the worldbuilding!Now, this book had two things I love dearly: dragons, and an academic setting. Yarros, however, explains almost every element of her world so poorly and sporadically that the entire story feels as though it were concocted page by page. The hierarchy of squadrons and sections and wings is so unnecessarily confusing. The whole ""war"" going on along the border is so vague, it was obvious from the start that some twist was going to reveal the good guys were actually the bad guys all along. The author\'s primary method of exposition is dropping pieces of information into conversations that feel forced and completely unnatural. No one talks like that. No one shares information like that.Now, the writing!The sentence constructions alone were enough to give me a headache. I can\'t tell you how many times I had to reread entire paragraphs because of poorly written and run-on sentences. As for the dialogue, let\'s discuss the fact that everyone talks like it\'s 2023, despite the medieval setting. I\'m not kidding, the female character asks herself at least twice, using these exact words, ""Is it toxic that I like this guy even though he can kill me?"" Yes. Yes it is. And so is all this internal monologuing. Please, end my suffering. Apart from the sentences and dialogue, the descriptions were severely lacking. Every location felt like a vague impression rather than an actual place. I don\'t think I\'ve ever encountered a book suffering from white room syndrome quite like this one.Now for the characters. Oh, the characters.Starting with the main event, we have frail young Violet who is SO relatable because she\'s SO clumsy and SO bad at things! Simultaneously, she is SO smart (like smarter than everyone) and SO unique that she gets not one, but TWO dragons to bond with her! And of course, they\'re both the rarest kind of dragons that exist!!! And naturally, everyone wants her dead for... reasons. But does her life being in danger give her any sense of self control? Absolutely not! She argues with everyone and throws her sass around to both peers and superior officers with little to no consequence. This woman has the survival skills of a fruit fly!! Additionally, her moods go back and forth quicker than an Olympic ping-pong match. First she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. Then she loves Xaden because she decides to trust him. Then she hates Xaden because he\'s a traitor. I\'m expecting the cycle will continue in Book 2. Also, she starts off wanting to be a scribe and gets pissed when she\'s thrown into the Rider\'s Quadrant, then she decides she desperately wants to be a Rider because... because? The decision is given hardly any explanation or emotional weight.And then there\'s discount Rhsysand. Oh wow, the moody black-haired rebel with tattoos is actually the good guy. Shocking. He\'s hard on the outside, but a softie on the inside. Groundbreaking. Also, the way that Yarros writes his character from Violet\'s perspective is downright sickening at times. From the very first scene with him, Violet\'s internal thoughts about Xaden are grossly objectifying. Everything is about his body, and how hot he is, and how badly she wants to sleep with him. There\'s an entire scene spanning two pages where Violet and another woman are straight-up ogling shirtless Xaden while he\'s sparring with another guy. It\'s disgusting. If the roles were reversed, if a male author wrote about a male character viewing a woman in the same way, heads would be rolling. It\'s gross, and frankly one of the most disappointing things about this book.Honestly, none of the other characters were interesting enough to write about. The dragons were fine, and probably the most likeable. Sawyer was the only human I found tolerable. Dain was just annoying, as he was clearly meant to be.Now, the plot.The majority of this book was consumed by Violet being horny and a random series of challenges. There was no explanation anywhere of what the academic year would look like, which makes me think the author was just making up more challenges and battles and war games as she went along. All of this, of course, leading up to a real challenge where we find out information that was abundantly obvious from the start. Oh no, the good guys are the bad guys. The bad guys are the good guys. The dead brother is actually alive. I wish I cared about any of this, but I don\'t because it\'s been so blatantly obvious since the first chapter. The pacing of this book was tedious in a lot of places because there wasn\'t really any kind of looming threat beyond the vague allusions to bigger attacks along the border. Nothing in this book surprised me. Nothing came even remotely close. Everything was so over-ridden with cliches and ideas from other books (mainly Divergent, and a little bit of Red Queen with the not-dead-brother ending) that nothing felt original or creative at all.I have searched earnestly, to the farthest hills on the horizon, for something good in this book. Alas, I return to my homeland empty-handed.And here\'s the thing: I so desperately wanted to enjoy this book, which makes it all the more disappointing. If you\'ve made it this far, I want you to know I did not approach this book with the intention of feeling this way. If you enjoyed this book, kudos to you. Feel free to keep on enjoying it. These are just my thoughts and opinions, and I\'ll content myself to be the cranky grandma of Goodreads if need be.

I am in loveeeeee, easily the best book I read this year and one of the best romantasy I\'ve read in a while.

All she needs to do is not get killed and bond with a dragon, but it\'s not as easy. Not only she has to escape the clutches of the students who want her dead, with few dragons willing to bond; she also has to keep away fromXaden, MMCwho wants her dead.From page 1 till page 633 I was hooked. Theworld buildingis detailed and well thought out. Theplotis consistent and true to itself. Thepacing,fluctuates a bit in the second half but mostly stays fast paced for the majority of the book.""Tell me what you\'re thinking?""""I was thinking you are exactly as I predicted the first time you took me in my room.""""Oh yeah? And what was that?""""A very dangerous addiction.""Coming to thecharacters-⚡Violet-I loved her. She\'s brave, compassionate, goes to lengths to protect others and knows how to stand up for herself and others. Having had chronic illness, people always underestimate her(all but one)but that\'s what makes her an underdog. I liked how balanced her character and personality was, never over the top. Loved following her journey through the war school and boy how she developed and grew in those pages.🖤Xaden-Idk if anyone else is saying this but I will- Xaden has the same vibe that Warwick from Savage Lands does, but Xaden does it better. There\'s just something about their personality that\'s so similar. Give the Savage Lands series a go if you liked Xaden. Anyway, I loved him so much. He\'s a badass. Once her started opening up, and we got to see the softer side of him- I was swooning. He\'s powerful, sexy, and knows when to pick his battles, certainly not a push over.Dain-What an ass. Radiates the same energy as Tamlin in ACOMAF.The othersupporting charactersare good as well, they grow on ya- especially the dragons and Liam. Tairn and Adarana have my heart. I loved them since the first time they spoke. They have a sense of humour, are badass and protect so fiercely. Saegyl was okay-ish, not much of her tbh.Now I want a dragon 😭""I\'m going to keep you.

And if you like thecharacters being jealous,you\'ll enjoy that trope here too. I do think there was a pinch of ""who did this to you"" but wasn\'t that impactful. Xaden and Violet\'schemistryis off the charts. They compliment each other so well and I like how open and honest they are with each other, and that both of them don\'t hold each other back and give the other room to make mistakes, learn and grow. It is a mature relationship yeah. Also, thesmutwas hot.. no seriously, things did get hot and broken down 🤭Theendingwas an emotional rollercoaster. I was crying so much at one point, had to take deep breaths to resume reading. I cannot wait for the sequel 🤩It\'s such a masterpiece in my opinion.

You can\'t help but root for her as the quintessential underdog bc she never lets herself be a victim despite her physical limitations.

Of my time and money.I can’t decide whether to rate this 2 or 1 ⭐️.It’s a 1 ⭐️ rating. 🤦🏾\u200d♀️I’m about to drop some truth bombs,so if this is the type of book for you in where you don’t want to hear any form of slander, then look away.I’m going to be honest about my reading experience, which wasn’t all that great.😓It seems that fantasy romances, whether they’re adult or YA, have been using the same formula these past few years in where the focus solely lies on the plot and the action scenes and the same attention isn’t given to the characters and their world. And I do not understand why that is the case. The balance between them all is off.The characters (all of them, not a single one was interesting) lacked substance, background and history. So by nature, I’m not even remotely interested in rooting for them and seeing them overcome the challenges they’re facing, because they are so poorly developed to begin with.The foundation of this world felt unbelievably flimsy and read messy to me. It was supposed to feel dangerous, the stakes were supposed to be high. Characters were being killed left, right and centre and the only thing I felt was nothing.There was no order to the way it was being built upon. Just chaos, convenience and stupidity all round.Violet’s character could’ve been made more interesting (to me) if:▪️We had we seen her time as a scribe before she was forced to become a rider.▪️See her actually train and get stronger.▪️See how she generally fought through her chronic pain.▪️See her deal with the grief of her brother.▪️Explore the weird dynamic she has with her mother.▪️See the friendships forming and the romance truly developing.▪️See her fuckin’ bonding with those dragons.All of these things would’ve added nuance and depth to her characterisation, to the actual story itself. Are we privy to any of that? No. Those aspects are mentioned and that’s supposed to be good enough whereas I would’ve liked layers.Characters shouldn’t read so one-dimensional.And enemies-to-lovers where? Please. 🙄 This trope was used in the most juvenile way.You could argue that the romance itself was juvenile.We could’ve honed in on the hate since both these characters suffered losses, come from different and opposing backgrounds, have some real animosity and tension built between them but the love interest was hardly ever present.Next thing you know, the trope was flung out the window instead of it being morphed into something real.So, I fail to understand why this was sold as a fantasy romance.I can’t tell you why these two liked each other, let alone love. There was no development ofgenuine, romantic feelings.There was a buildup of attraction and supposed sexual tension. But that’s it.Another thing that bugged me is that we only got Violet’s perspective. I mean, this occasionally works, but ideally,no fantasy book should have a singular POV.I can’t begin to tell you how boring that narrative is.It gives such a limiting and subjective view of the world and the characters, and this especially gets more limiting when there are other characters present that also play a significant role in the story.Yet they weren’t utilised.Is it that hard to give different perspectives?The dragons were theONLYinteresting parts about this whole book.But they didn’t even get as much page time as they should’ve. They deserved more page time. I mean, if you’re going to have them talking, give them a POV as least. They could’ve told us about their own history.There were also some language choices that were made that felt odd in a fantasy setting.“Personally, I’m not arguing with their logic, just enjoying the view…respectfully, of course…”“So. Freaking. Beautiful.”“Holy. Fuckin. Hot.”No one talks like that in a fantasy world. 😒You know damn well some of this lingo doesn’t belong here. It’s so embarrassing and a testament to bad writing and bad editing.To top it all off, I still don’t know whether this was adult, new adult or YA fantasy. I couldn’t tell you. Goodreads has them all listed. Clearly, everyone is confused.In conclusion, all of this to say that this brand of poorly written, poorly developed fantasy story is just not for me. This book was not for me. I had a really difficult time immersing myself into the story.The ending was somewhat interesting, but by that point I was skim-reading. And I don’t care about this book enough to continue on with the series. I want to forget I ever read it.I’m avoiding all hyped books for the foreseeable future. 😪💔'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5⭐️😍 OMG THIS IS THE (second) WORST BOOK IVE EVER READ IN MY ENTIRE EXISTENCE!!!🥰I’ve posted my iron flame review!! You can go read it if you liked this one :)Violet Sorrengail. Get it? SOARING-GALE BECAUSE DRAGONS SOAR ON GALES 🧍🏻\u200d♀️ THATS SO CLEVER.She’s like so badass because she’s like so dainty and like so small and has insert name chronic illness which makes her so badass and a really good candidate for a WAR SCHOOL. She is totally not a self-insert of the author because unlike the author she doesn’t have blonde hair, she has ultra special brown hair that turns a really rare silver as she gets older. (Because hair pigment works like that🤭)She’s also so super really fast because she’s SOO petite and small and little and fragile.And also the love interest is SOO much bigger than her and he’s the most powerful darkness-wielding highlord—oh sorry I mean dragon rider at the academy.because Violet being the daughter of the literal leader of the school wasn’t enough, she also gets a super mega rare giant black dragon AND a never-before-seen golden useless ass feathertailed baby dragon that has the ability to manipulate time. And don’t worry, Violet can summon lightning just in case you were concerned that Mare Barrow was the most obnoxious lightning wielder.Rebecca Yarrows is such a good writer 😍 all of her world building and info dumps are so unbearable to read!! Plus her writing is entirely YA and juvenile except for the horrific car crash level sex scenes that happen 80% into the book. What a slay!!All of her characters make me want to rip my eyeballs out🥰 but especially Xaden because he’s so tortured and scary and so much bigger than our poor baby fragile pathetic paper-boned protagonist Violet soaring-gale.The enemies to lovers is also so well done!! They were literally never even enemies😍 and I didn’t once believe they felt anything other than the most surface level lust for the other🤭Also why the fuck did Yarrows decide that when the dragons fuck that their riders also get really horny? That was information I did not ever need.The world building was so amazingly perfect!! I loved how she info dumped entire paragraphs of exposition and random facts onto us, but still never managed to outline how the actual school worked or why the fuck the gryphons couldn’t just be incinerated by the giant ass dragons with literal magic!!!!😍Oh, I also really enjoyed how the single black character with any personality was not only bisexual but hyper sexual and slept around with everyone!!! It was really great how Rhiannon was sidelined the entire novel so that Violet could also be useless!I also love how we don’t get to know anything about any of the side characters because Violet is too concerned with fucking Xaden!! 🥵The nickname of “Violence” for Violet, the character that literally did not kill a single person until the 75% mark also made a lot of sense!! I’m so glad she was at a war school and wasn’t required to kill a single person or even ever actually train without cheating her way through by poisoning her opponents!! She will totally not die in actual combat when she can’t sneak random ass made-up poisons into her opponents’ meals!! 😝I think it’s also so inspiring how Violet’s tiny 90 pound frame literally could not support swinging an 11 pound sword, but the dragons did not murder her for being weak (her words not mine) because she was so strong mentally because she complained about being in pain (despite claiming to be used to pain?) and so delicate and fragile all the time!! 🤩Also let’s just not talk about how Violet totally plays into the “toxic perseverance” trope by actively ignoring the symptoms and effects her disability has on her body and powers through everything because she’s “used to pain”!! That’s so good and such a good example to set <3It could have been interesting if Violet actually found ways to accommodate for her weaknesses/disadvantages that made sense, but clearly Yarros doesn’t actually give a fuck so she didn’t bother. The only example we have of this is a saddle which I’m sorry is stupid as fuck because why was everyone not already using saddles?? Did Miss Rebecca ever look into how fucking uncomfortable it can be not use a saddle or padding while riding horses much less consider how painful it might be to ride a giant, roughly scaled DRAGON that is FLYING THROUGH THE SKY?? 🙈This book was so incredible😍 I can’t believe booktok didn’t force this down everyone’s throats sooner!! It was so great to read this horrendous amalgamation of shitty world building, horrifically atrocious writing, and one dimensional characters with a nonsensical plot and a underdeveloped romance!!Legitimately the worst book I’ve ever read. I would unkindly ask Rebecca Yarros to never write another word in her life.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '— 5 stars ✰I LOVE YOU REBECCA YARROS”you gave me your heart, and i’m keeping it.i knew i was going to love this book. the amount of five star reviews & the talk aboutfourth wingon social media had me intrigued since the beginning & i’mhappyto confirm that this book is indeed worth the hype. like, mind-blowing-amazing 🫡dragon, dragon-school, competition, tension, enemies to lovers, you get thrown right into the plot, you have amazing antagonists. this book was purelyperfection. everything your heart desires, you’ll get it. nothing better than a fantasy novel with a subplot of romance, a good plot twist and am amazing cliffhanger. yes, you heard correctly. a cliffhanger. i might die right here right then because how am i supposed to wait that long for the sequel to come out?PLS GIVE ME THE SEQUEL NOW!! 🫠🫠—xadenriorsen. the man of the hour. the moment he appeared, i fell in love with him. i might be exaggerating but who cares, right? it’s the way violet describes him, i mean, how could you not fall in love with a brooding dragon rider who has a cut through his eyebrow. what makes him even hotter is the fact that he is the leader of the forth wing and oh my god, his “welcoming” speech.. i don’t know how yarros managed to make himthishot in a few sentences only. it’s his confidence. yes, that must be it. totally not his broad shoulders. or his rank. or his dark hair.“i had it made for you.” his lips curve slightly.his love language has to be acts of service. this man might have taken a while to admit his feelings but the things he did for violet? unbelievable. he was so ruined for her & i was so ready for it.—violet, my beloved. i justlovedhow everyone underestimated her and then she showed them what’s beneath that “fragile” body everyone seems to think she has. what i enjoyed most about her was that we saw her development, saw her fight for the place in the school and proving everyone wrong. she has a good sense of humor and wit, making me giggle — especially when she was flirting with a certain someone.“there’s a fucking smirk onxaden’s arrogant, handsome face.”there were so many chapters i enjoyed that were purely about violet without any mention of xaden & that means so much to me. there have been so many fantasy books were i was just so bored out of my mind when the love interest wasn’t there bc not everyone knows how to write a badass fmc with a great personality. rebecca yarros absolutely nailed it tho. the plot is just so gripping, you get sucked into their story and just want to read more about their world.as i am a big fan of game of thrones & house of the dragons, this book was a total hit for me. i loved reading about the dragons, the different breeds, their history, their shape and color and abilities.—xaden and violet. violet and xaden. you know who they reminded of? tris and four. the young new girl everyone scoffs at, the intimidating older guy everyone fears. also let’s not forget that xaden was the only person mira told violet to stay away from 🤭 their first interactions were so full of tension already, i was giggling and blushing and they’ve only changed a few words by then.”going for blood today, are we, violence?”did i mention that we get a training scene? but like a really hot, full of tension, angsty, fighting scene. she attacks him, he catches her fist, she tries again, he pulls her back against his chest, she jumps him, he pins her down. i could go on and on and on, believe me, it was really freaking hot.we even get a “let-me-see-your-injuries“ scene and if you thought the fighting scene was impeccable, then you have to read about this one. jaw? on the floor 💗💞🩷💕💘”there is no me without you.”—dain, what a hypocrite. you know who this ass reminds me of? adam kent and freaking gale hawthorne. i get that he wants to protect violet but he’s holding her back unlike xaden who wants her to unravel and become stronger. speaking of that, they remind me so much of warnette in that matter. i’m not done, they’re even torydarius coded. i loved seeing their relationship develop in a long time span. days pass, weeks pass, months pass. it’s not like they were enemies and then suddenly a week later they decided to like each other, nope, it definitely took them weeks to even admit their connection. they might be enemies to the core but who doesn’t love a good old enemies to lovers?alsojackreminded me so much of cato hadley from the hunger games. i know he’s evil and all that but every books needs a cato. and he got we deserved soooPLS I NEED THE NEXT BOOK AS OF NOW 💥💥'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 🌟OK SO I GOT PLAYED A LITTLE!!!!THE GOODThis was a HIGHLY enjoyable book. I had so much uni work to do, but I still flew through it. The author wasted no time – she made a fast-paced, action-packed, well established fantasy world. I love how we got introduced to bits and aspects of this world slowly, she really KNEW how to world build, how to ease us into this complicated setting. AT EVERY POINT OF THIS BOOK I knew what was going on, who I was rooting for, what are the aims of the particular scene. And you, my fellow fantasy readers, know how that doesn’t always happen. Like I said in the updates, EVERY SINGLE PAGE WAS A PLOT POINT and no fill-ins. I hate it when writers drag the story, you can really tell when they do that, and fantasy authors are for some reason prone to doing that. This wasn’t such a book. It’s not that long (around 400 pages) and I wasn’t bored in any scene. I love how the story intensified towards the end, but the stakes were high throughout the WHOLE THING.THAT Xaden CHAPTER ATEATEATEATE, I LOVED IT SO MUCH!AND THAT PLOT TWIST IT ENDED ON, I COULD NEVER EVEN IMAGINE THAT HAPPENING! UGH, I can’t wait for the next book.THE BADI said it before, WILL SAY IT AGAIN, this is the most formulaic book I’ve read in my life. You know when popular musicians make songs SPECIFICALLY so they can become popular on TikTok and you SOMEHOW ALWAYS KNOW. Yes, this was that, but for books. You can really tell the author used EVERY SINGLE TROPE she knows people love and will eat up and put it in her book (enemies to lovers, mated pairs, the whole rebellion trope, I’m the chosen one but I don’t want to be that blablabla), I just couldn’t get past that fact. Before reading this book I saw a few posts saying how this book is similar to ACOTAR. When I just started it, I didn’t really see the resemblance, but THEN I GOT IT. Dain is SOOOO Tamlin coded, Xaden is basically Rhysand, again the rebellion thing, THE MATES THING (god I hate that so much). I wouldn’t call this a carbon copy of ACOTAR, but you can’t tell me it wasn’t loosely inspired by it (for the sole purpose of satisfying booktok).This was in no way original, and that’s the number one thing I didn’t like about this book. There wasn’t a single thing happening, a plot point, a scene, a character trait, that I haven’t seen before. This plays into this being EXTREMELY FORMULAIC.For those who read it, is it just me? (I know it isn’t)THE DRAGONS WERE SO FUNNY. I’m sorry, I didn’t like the dragons. I liked them individually (as almost characters) BUT they WERE IN NO WAY WELL WRITTEN. They’re supposed to be these mysterious, dangerous, sacred creatures, but Violet’s dragon says the word FUCK at one point. I LAUGHED SO MUCH, HAD ME ON THE FLOOR.THE CHARACTERSUgh, they’re supposed to be adults, but they’re SO YA CODED. You can’t tell me Violet is 20.Surprisingly, I liked the protagonists, but individually. They’re both flawed, but also with a sense of moral, a great combination of characteristics. However, them as a couple, not really. The banter was there in the beginning but then it just evaporated. They went from being enemies to LOVERS THE PLANET HASN’T SEEN so quickly. They were enemies for a good chunk of pages, I must admit that, but the change was in no way gradual (pls go to the Mariana Zapata slow burn school k thanks).(And also, Violet was so desperate with the L word, GIRLIE STAND UP!!!)The spice was good ngl (had me kicking my feet lol)I LOVED THE SIDE CHARACTERS. RHIANNON AND LIAM (sorrows sorrows prayers) HAVE MY HEART.FINAL THOUGHTSThis was a fast-paced, highly enjoyable first book in the series I will for sure continue reading when the next installment is out. It wasn’t very memorable and won’t make the FAVORITES list, but I still had fun reading. I’m leaving room for improvement.Is it overhyped, tell me in the comments??? (let’s have a respectful discussion)💕💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'if y’all see me on the news tomorrow it’s because i broke into this author’s house and tried to steal the manuscript for the sequel…i can’t even begin to describe the attachment and love i have for this book and its characters. it’s one of my favorite books of all time now. the author really wrote the most heart wrenching, emotionally loaded, appetite terminating sentences and said “deal with it.”to put into few words: this new adult fantasy romance book is set at a war college, there’s dragons, and there’s 2 main opposing sides that hate one another. our fmc belonging to one and our mmc belonging to the other. i think you can see where this is going…WRONG because you could have 30 guns pointing at my head and i still wouldn’t have predicted THAT last sentence. all my brain matter would cover the wall behind me.Violet aka Violence (iykyk) is my favorite character all around. she’s just like me for real. the way she thinks and talks. she’s really a girls girl. i usually prefer dual pov but not in this case. being in her head made me realize i’ve never had an original thought. she’s a fmc written by a woman to its core. she strong, resilient, a fucking genius, badass, witty af, compassionate, and so damn attractive…god idk if i wanna be her or be with her… everything she goes through and overcomes made me shed a tear or 7. she’s unpredictable and that’s what i love about her.Xaden…i’ve never read a man described so damn sexy. i was in heat and prepared to do a line off this man’s stomach…his middle name is basically “self control” and the way that crumbles from just the mere existence of Violet. he says it best when “i’m annoyingly aware of everything you do…”i appreciated how he has a personality outside of the slow (and i mean slow) burn romance. he’s protective but not overbearing. he’s idealistic and charming without even trying. he “hates” her but literally had daggers made for her specific body shape and fit. he had a saddle made for her body type so she doesn’t fall off her dragon. he’s so thoughtful and attentive, it comes natural to him like breathing. the longing that’s in his eyes when he simply glances at violet (you’d think he’d be plotting her death from an outsider looking in) was written like poetry. Violet has him so tightly wrapped around her finger and they can’t even begin to understand the depths of it…one would think the romance would be my hyper fixation for this book but it’s not even that (not only that.) it’s the fucking dragons! the way they are described, have personalities of their own, the way they always check and roast Violet had me LOLing and giddy. the bonds they have with their riders felt as real as oxygen in the air! 😮\u200d💨some quotes that aren’t spoilery but still had me barking like a dog in heat:👹“heat rushes through every vein, wakes every nerve ending. I hate the reaction of my body to the site of him, but I can’t deny it. His appeal is so fucking inconvenient.” she is so me coded“i know how to handle a corset” and he does“There’s a palpable energy in every room, he enters, and brushes over my skin, like a caress each time our eyes meet. Even now, I’m aware of every breath he takes, as he sits next to me midway down the table.”“fuck, that stubborn, feisty look always makes me want to kiss you.” god he’s so miserable 😩the MCs and dragons dynamic is so uniquely and well written like nothing else i’ve read. it’s so ying and yang coded. this book, in short, is a limb to me. cut it off, i bleed out and die! it is diverse, rich, deep, magnificently written, and every fiber of me loves it (i say all of this referring to a piece of media that ruined my life🥲)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""This is kinda harsh but my honest opinion after reading the ARC ~** May 2023 edit: I'm a bookseller and read a variety of genres including children's and YA. My issues are not with these genres. My issues are with books that read as clumsy, horny (and not in a fun camp way), and unpolished. Which in my Personal Opinion(tm)!!!!!!!!!! this book is.It's pretty stock standard commercial horny hetero fiction. That's fine. Can't please everyone. I'll be totally honest: if you don't care that much about quality of writing and want an easy het romance-fantasy novel à la Cassandra Clare et al. (nothing wrong with that!), you may enjoy this. It's not my thing, though, and I can't recommend it if you want a decent wholemeal fantasy novel to sink your teeth into. **I found this disappointing and I’m frankly shocked it has such glowing early reviews.To be fair, my disappointment is partly caused by the misleading blurb and ARC marketing. The blurb implies a high stakes military fantasy set at a war college for dragon riders; this put me in mind of Temeraire, The Poppy War, or even elements of The Hunger Games. Romance is mentioned - “traitors will become allies… or lovers” - but it’s certainly not implied to be wholly a romance novel.I saw on the author’s instagram that this is being marketed as a “new adult fantasy” - if 'new adult' just means ‘lacking the sophistication of genre fiction but can’t be marketed as YA romance because of sex scenes’… then, sure, call it 'new adult'.All the characters - even supposed high-ranking military figures - speak like millennials from the year 2023. Why was the word ‘vibe’ used so many times? As in, ‘his vibe is weird’. But in other ways the setting recalls medieval Europe? Who edited this???I would not have picked this up if the marketing more accurately reflected the content. It’s 100% a romance novel in the vein of Cassandra Claire, Sarah J. Maas, the Divergent series; any genuine stakes are basically subplot to the central romance. The oh-so-important ~tension~ could be resolved by just… talking to one another? Most other world building elements are underdeveloped & confusing, full of plot holes, and everyone’s dialogue is set up to give the protagonist & ~dark~ love interest perfect Marvel-esque quips and one-liners. I get that this is a popular thing but to me it lacks sophistication and polish of contemporary fantasy :-)Also, my certified transgender opinion (tm) is that the inclusion of a random nonbinary side character was disingenuous and definitely tokenism, lol.The reason for two stars instead of one is because I found the representation of the protagonist's disability - and how it was navigated in such physically demanding settings - genuinely interesting.All in all, this, to me, read like a semi-edited fanfic. If that’s your thing, go buckwild. Otherwise, I can’t really recommend it. The blurb is pretty misleading, imo. Expect a YA romance novel.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Decide, Violet. Are you going to die a scribe? Or live as a rider?""Oh, this is good. I see now why y\'all love it so much.IfFourth Wingwere a drug, I\'d be an addict. It grabbed me so thoroughly from the very first moment and refused to let go. I was fully immersed, I didn\'t want to sleep, didn\'t want to eat. I just wanted to inhale it as fast as I could. And honestly, isn\'t this why we read, for this exact feeling?The action begins right on the first page and never lets up. There was no onerous worldbuilding, no endless backgrounds or introductions. We just seamlessly slip into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. Every time I get the itch to read fantasy, the one thing that holds me back is how much worldbuilding I would have to endure just to get to the good parts. But no such issues here. The good parts start right at the beginning.Is this the most original story? No. Is this the most well written? Also no. (Don\'t kill me for saying that, all you rabid fans.) In fact, the dialogue has me cringing at times, with its penchant for f-bombs as emphasis and its often basic but slightly pompous back-and-forth that only teenagers can pull off. I guess in that way, it is true to its characters since they\'re all not much older than teenagers.But slight criticisms aside, this story is executed to perfection. It takes several well-trodden tropes and not only cohesively blends them together, but also manages to squeeze every ounce of entertainment out of them along the way. And I\'m not above being entertained.This is my first real foray into the romantasy genre that\'s got everyone aflutter. And I can see the appeal. Fantasy is a bit of an adrenaline rush and so is romance, so blending the two together is really the perfect symbiosis. Of course you\'d want your hero to fight hard in a war between good and evil. And it totally makes sense that they would love hard too if they could die any day. And if the object of desire is one\'s enemy instead of one\'s friend? Even better.I\'m a little late to theFourth Wingparty, and there\'s good reason. I was certain this was a duology (don\'t ask me why I thought this), so I figured if I just held off a little bit, I could bam my way through both books without having to stop and deal with the inevitable anguish of waiting for the next book.

So many great descriptive words and all this author can do is spout curse words. Curse words do not a personality make. Neither is being a horny 13 year old.

But Threshing was only the first impossible test meant to weed out the weak-willed, the unworthy, and the unlucky.Now the real training begins, and Violet’s already wondering how she’ll get through. It’s not just that it’s grueling and maliciously brutal, or even that it’s designed to stretch the riders’ capacity for pain beyond endurance. It’s the new vice commandant, who’s made it his personal mission to teach Violet exactly how powerless she is–unless she betrays the man she loves.Although Violet’s body might be weaker and frailer than everyone else’s, she still has her wits—and a will of iron. And leadership is forgetting the most important lesson Basgiath has taught her: Dragon riders make their own rules.But a determination to survive won’t be enough this year.Because Violet knows the real secret hidden for centuries at Basgiath War College—and nothing, not even dragon fire, may be enough to save them in the end.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '3 ⭐️ The ending . . .

No matter how hard I try, I cannot get this book out of my head, all because of those last 25 pages . . . \u2060How dare Rebecca do this to us, knowing we have to wait god knows how long for book 3. 😭\u2060Did I enjoy it?Yes.\u2060Was it better than Fourth Wing?No.\u2060But will I continue the series?Abso-f*cking-lutely!\u2060This book is really hard for me to rate because while I enjoyed the story and the ending, there were a lot of technical (plot/character) issues that definitely hindered my overall enjoyment.*SPOILERS AHEAD*\u2060What I liked:\u2060The story is action-packed from start to finish, so you\'ll never want to put this book down.Iron Flame is divided into two parts. Part one takes place at Basgiath War College and part two focuses on the Revolution. There\'s 623 pages total, and I genuinely felt like I read two books because so much happens. I\'m glad I took detailed notes because I\'ve already forgotten a lot and I know I\'ll need to refer to them before starting book 3.The continued world-building is fascinating.Like I said, this story is non-stop and that includes uncovering new information about the history and politics of this world. We now have a solid idea on what\'s really happening on the continent, however, there\'s still so many unanswered questions about the past (before the unification), the venin, and the Empyrean. I love this phase of a long series because there\'s still so much we don\'t know or understand, and I can\'t wait to see everything unfold and come together in the next few books. \u2060These characters are some of my favorites and need to be protected at all costs.Violet is still a badass. Xaden is still daddy. Tairn is fucking hilarious. And Andarna is the sassiest bitch in the realm. I do wish she wasn\'t away for half the story though.Violet internally struggled a lot more in this book by bottling up her emotions, distancing herself from her friends, and taking on too much responsibility (like researching the wards).Violet is just as strong and determined as she was in Fourth Wing, but in Iron Flame, we see the toll everything takes on her. I\'m glad that by part two she starts to lean on her friends more, but I\'m worried how she\'s going to manage after the events at the end of book 2. There\'s only so much a person can take, and I fear Violet may break at some point in the future. I\'m looking forward to seeing how her character develops in the rest of the series.PS: Violet during the torture scenes and and final battle when she saves Sawyer was impressive as hell! I respect her so much and strive to be just as badass.Xaden is still top tier book boyfriend material.Look, he is not perfect. In fact, I\'m a little pissed at him for constantly putting the responsibility of sharing truths on Violet throughout this story when he could have easily been open and forthcoming. BUT I DON\'T CARE. That man is just so damn confident, intelligent, sexy and loyal to Violet, that the minute he\'s on the page, I lose my damn mind. And when he writes letters to Violet . . . I melted. He isn\'t even a romantic guy, but did one of the most romantic things in the world.There\'s also a lot of side characters (both old and new) that I enjoyed getting to know better:Rhi, Ridoc, Imogen, Bodhi, Mira, Brennan, Sawyer, Jesinia, Sloane, and Maren. There\'s also a bunch of characters I loathe and wanted to see die a slow and painful death. Some don\'t. Some do. *cough* Varrish *cough*. Fuck that guy. But I can\'t complain, because everyone likes a good villain and Iron Flame definitely had a few!PS: I don\'t hate Dain anymore.Obviously, what he did was absolutely horrible and I don\'t think I can ever truly forgive him for the role he played in Liam\'s death. BUT we have to remember, he didn\'t know what was going to happen and seems to be very repentant for it all. Do I trust him? Hell no. But do I think he\'s a bad guy? No. I still think he needs to redeem himself, so I\'ll be curious to see where his character goes from here.Those few chapters with imaginary Liam were everything.😭 Liam\'s death absolutely broke me and still haunts me to this day. So seeing him again, in the way that we did, gave me some closure. But this entire situation has me wondering (THEORY AHEAD), what if Violet\'s second signent is her talking to the dead?! We know a lot of history has been lost or written out of existence, so I\'m wondering if the only way Violet can find answers is through some power of communicating with the dead?RIP Mama Sorrengail.For all of Fourth Wing and most of Iron Flame, I hated her. And honestly, even after everything, I still don\'t like her very much. However, while I know she wasn\'t a great person or mom, I understand her choices. Again, I don\'t agree with them, but she really thought she was protecting her children. I wept when she died, not because I am sad she\'s dead, but for Brennan, Mira, and Violet. They now know that even if their mom was misguided, her intention was driven by the love of her children and now that she\'s gone, they\'ll mourn what was and what could have been. They each had such different responses and I felt them all.The ending . . .I mean, I\'ve already talked enough about it but DAMN, I DID NOT SEE THAT COMING. I predicted General Sorrengail would die but I thought maybe Violet would get taken by the Sage or something. So yeah, I am still completely shocked by that ending, maybe even a little pissed, and will be sending Rebecca Yarros my next therapy bill.What I didn\'t like:This is a small gripe, but why are they using the Julian Calendar in this fantasy world?I mean, Rebecca created a completely new world but couldn\'t come up with different names for the months of the year? Every time it mentioned December or July, it totally took me out of the story.\u2060The pacing was frantic and for what?So much happens, yet, at the same time, I didn\'t feel like a lot happened to push the overarching plot forward. The highlights are: Violet goes back to school, Violet tries to learn about wards, Violet gets tortured, Violet and half the college goes back to revolution headquarters, Xaden and Violet get the luminary, and then the final battle happens. We didn\'t need 600+ pages just to give us that. @listenwithbritt mentioned in an IG reel that the pacing felt like she was watching a TV series, and I totally agree. Every few chapters felt like a TV episode with some small task that needed to be accomplished or there was a hurdle to overcome; then it would get quickly resolved and they\'d move onto the next thing. There were a lot of small subplots that were unimportant and felt like filler scenes. So the constant bombardment of action, angst, or mystery was a bit overwhelming and it was hard to decipher at the time what scenes were really important for the overall story. For example, what real value did the survival class or the death hike scenes offer? In my opinion, not much but creating small moments of conflict to keep the story moving along. Maybe Rebecca wrote Iron Flame this way since the series is getting turned into a TV series by Amazon.The story was too dense.There were too many new names, history, and general knowledge to really keep track of what was important. And there were quite a few things that weren\'t fully explained or were overlooked. Pair that with the frantic pacing, and there wasn\'t enough time to fully digest all this new information before we were forced to move on to the next part of the story. I had to read slowly, re-read sections, and take notes to keep track of everything. Doing that for 16 hours was a bit overwhelming and exhausting.I HATED the other woman (OW) drama.It’s a tacky, cheap, and overdone romance conflict and totally unnecessary. There was also a big inconsistency surrounding it. First off, Bodhi mentions Cat early on by saying how Xaden has never cared so much about anyone, not even Cat, which alluded that at some point Xaden was involved with and potentially cared deeply for another woman. But later, Xaden says Cat could die for all he cares and he has never loved her. So why was Violet lead to believe he had feelings for another woman at some point? Solely to create drama between Xaden and Violet. And why didn’t Violet ask Xaden about Cat the minute she found out about her? If she did this, she wouldn’t have been blindsided by it all CHAPTERS LATER when they went to get the luminary from Cat’s family.Also, Xaden should have been transparent about Cat when it first came up so Violet didn\'t spend chapters feeling insecure. And the way Cat was a nasty bitch to Violet the entire book, but then randomly decides she\'s cool with her after Violet saves her life was so anticlimactic. This was probably the weakest sub-plot of the entire book. And if there\'s more OW or OM drama in the rest of the series, I will fucking riot. Xaden better not use Cat to drive Violet away in the next book.I was underwhelmed by the romance.Honestly, their relationship was stagnant because they didn\'t have enough time together in this book. With Xaden being away for most of the first part and then they end up doing their own things for the Revolution during the second part, there was little time for them to really grow deeper as a couple.I also expected more groveling by Xaden at the beginning, but instead he makes Violet responsible for his honesty by saying she has to be the one to ask questions and then he\'ll answer. But for the entire book, Violet doesn\'t ask him anything! So, she doesn\'t get any answers! Meanwhile, Xaden just sits around, not communicating with Violet, when he could easily take the initiative to share his truths. Their lack of communication was so frustrating and was definitely done to create drama for the story. It was dumb and lazy writing. They could have easily set aside time to really hash out the issues of their relationship and dive deep into the secrets Xaden is keeping, but they don\'t.The smut also didn\'t hit this time.For the size of this book and the fact Xaden and Violet are an already established relationship, I expected at least five sex scenes, but we got three. Okay, I\'ll admit, the throne scene was hot but only because of the setting. I wasn\'t excited by the dirty talk and, yeah, the smut was just lackluster in my opinion. It wasn\'t bad, just forgettable.It didn\'t feel like any character had enough time to go through any real development.I think this occurred because there were so many new characters introduced that the attention of the story was split. Or maybe it\'s also because the story is in Violet\'s POV and she pulled away from everyone, so since she wasn\'t as ingrained in their lives, she didn\'t notice changes/growth? I don\'t know, but I wish we could have had more time with Xaden, Rhi, and Sloane.There were a few things that didn\'t really get explained.For example, why wouldn\'t Brennan encourage Violet to do research on wards? Violet was trained as a Scribe and would be an excellent person to assign for this task. I get he didn\'t think they would have enough time to figure it out and he thought they should focus on making more weapons, but no one assigned Violet a mission, so why have her do nothing instead of possibly finding a solution to win the war? His logic wasn\'t full-proof. Also, the end where Brennan fixes the wardstone. . . we spent the entire book trying to understand wards and then figure out how to mend them and somehow Brennan does this but we don\'t see how? It better be explained in the next book and not glossed over. Also, why did Xaden become venin? In the dream he has, the Sage said it would save Violet from dying while she was draining herself for the wardstone, but I don\'t see how thats true. If you have any ideas please let me know. And random but can someone please make a timeline of when Xaden would have been able to have a relationship with Cat? Because according to my math, he would have been, like, 14 years old! There are even more situations that needed an explanation but I don\'t have the energy to go through them all.Overall, Iron Flame was a decent sequel. I enjoyed it. I was entertained. But it was messy, and left me wanting more and less at the same time. It should have been shorter, the plot should have been cleaned up a bit, and we should have spent more time with our favorite characters instead of being introduced to a shit ton of new characters (whom I\'m still not sure are important). It really is entertaining though, so if you enjoyed Fourth Wing, you\'ll probably enjoy this one, or at the very least, be able to push through it.

I didn’t see that coming and while it wasn’t Zodiac Academy cliffhanger level of bad, cuz let’s be real nothing will be as horrific as Shadow Princess or Heartless Sky cliffhanger 💀\xa0Iron Flame ending had me spiralling.. how tf will this issue be resolvedIFit can even be resolved I’M NOT OKAY 😭😭😭Fourth Wing was so action packed and fast paced with lots of “OMG”-moments like when Violet bonded not one but two dragons, finding out the dragon’s power, certain sacrifices etc. So compared to the first book Iron Flame is much slower plotwise. It starts where Fourth Wing left off and continues with Violet and co. going back to Basgiath College for their second year and act like mentors for the new first year students.🗡️VIOLET SORRENGAIL(h) 🗡️”Violence, remember it’s only the body that’s fragile. You are unbreakable.”I love Violet so much, but I think she struggled a lot in this book with her position in this world and what her purpose is. Violet has the best intentions at heart, but feels like she is failing everyone and I just wanted to give her a hug this whole book 😭\xa0when she said that she never failed anything in her life but now she keeps failing and making the wrong decisions I felt for her!!But Vi’s struggle were actually the part that made me love her more. Yes, she did make some questionable decisions in this book, but that’s what makes her character so realistic for me. She tries her best and sometimes her best isn’t enough, but this girlnevergives up. She will keep standing up no matter how many times she gets kicked down. She will find the solution to the problem no matter how many hours she will need to research, but she will do the work.That scene with her Varrish and Nolan and a certain other character whose name I can’t name killed me 😭\xa0it was so painful to read.. Violet was so strong for enduring everything and not losing her mind completely.. I would have folded so quickly 🌚\xa0Violet Sorrengail best girl. There is a reason she bonded not one, but two dragons. 💅🔹XANDEN RIORSON(H) 🔹“Violet.” His gaze rakes over my face, lingering on my cheeks. I love the way he says my name. Sure, it’s the alcohol overruling my logic, but I want to hear him say it again. “Lieutenant Riorson.”LIEUTENANT RIORSON Y’ALL. If you think WINGLEADER Xaden was hot wait til you get Xaden as a lieutenant that just hits differently 🛐\xa0He was so hot in this book.Xaden has still so many secrets we don’t know about and I think there is still so much to his story. Like where did his mother disappear? I’m still so intrigued by his character and now even more after that ending… I didn’t see that coming and I’m still shocked. I wish we would get more Xaden POVs in the books because the one at the end is never enough… with that ending I hope that Xaden will be more of a focus in the next book, cause I just want to know more about him.🐉TAIRN & ANDARNA (DRAGONS)🐉“A rolling dismount would tear you limb from limb on impact,” he retorts.“You don’t know that,” Andarna counters with what seems to be her new default form of conversation—telling Tairn he’s wrong. A growl rumbles through Tairn’s chest, vibrating the saddle beneath me and the harness that holds Andarna to his chest.“I’d watch it,” I tell her, biting back a smile. “He might get tired and drop you.”“His pride would never allow it.”“Says the dragon who spent twenty minutes refusing to put on her harness,” Tairn fires back.It would be a huge lie if I’d say I haven’t missed my sunshine princess Andarna in this book, because I did, but eventually all babies have to grow up and Andarna became a teenager 🥺\xa0her angsty teenager attitude towards Tairn had me laughing my ass off. I love their relationship so much and they are the best father-daughter duo. Their bond is so precious! When Andarna said she wanted to be just like Tairn, because he is loyal, fierce and strong it made me so emotional 😭😭\xa0And to my grumpy, firerce, strong and loyal dragon Tairn.. I can only say that I thought I couldn’t love him more after Fourth Wing, but I do now. The way Tairn protects Violet and stands by her side is everything. The relationship that the dragons have with their riders is *chef’s kiss*🧚THE ROMANCE🧚I meant what I said on the parapet. Even when I’m not with you, there’s only youMy violetxaden heart was so happy!! I mean I knew Violet would be really stubborn about the Xaden lying to her thing and would hold it against him for quite some time, but I loved the angst that created. But Xaden is completely smitten with her and we love to see an obsessed boy. Vi doesn’t think that he would choose her over the revolution, but she doesn’t realized that Xaden would burn down the world for her 😌\xa0he is not like that rule-following loser Dain .. Xaden would break every rule for her and the way Xaden is so worried for Vi and wants to protect her has my heart melting into a puddle 🥰Also can we talk about Xaden writing Violet letters while he is away?? that is so romantic and had me going 🥺\xa0I only wished we could have read more of his letters and not only small excerps. Don’t be shy Rebecca give us the full content.👫SIDE CHARACTERS👫Rhiannon:my queen i love you, it took me forever to remember you name, but now you better survive until the end or i will personally hunt Rebecca til the end of the worldRidoc:my comedic king i love youImogen: i love you my other kickass queenDain:fuck you, i haven’t forgiven you and i don’t think i willJesinia:what a cutie, i like her and she better stays loyal to Violet and doesn’t betray herCat:FUCK YOU, but in capital letters.Varrish:oh i hope someone fucks you with a 10 inch pole i fucking hate you. that c*nt… why does every magical school has a Professor Umbridge character that is so detestable. This man will answer for all his sins and the atrocities he commited against Violet. I hope this loser never finds a moment of peace.to the rest of the side characters: you were either irrelevant, i couldn’t remember you’re names or i refuse to remember to name, cause you going to die either way in this book or later.👯\u200d♀️VIOLET & MIRA & BRENNAN👯\u200d♀️the scene where Mira finds out that Brennan is alive and punches him in the face lives in my mind rent free. That’s my girl lmao cause I would react the same way if I’d find out one of my sibling pretended to be death for the last six years. I’D BE LIVID.But it was great to see all Sorrengail siblings back together. I love seeing them all together and get a glimpse of their different dynamics with each other. When Mira and Brennan were fighting and Violet was just standing next to them and felt like their little sister again dksdskd 😭\xa0I love them and they are all badasses in their own way.🔻WHY IRON FLAME WAS WEAKER THAN FOURTH WING IMO🔻↠ if Fourth Wing was Catching Fire (The Hunger Games) then I’d say that Iron Flame is Mockingjay in terms of action and pace. As I mentioned abovethis book is much more slower paced. It’s one of those books where a lot happens, but at the same time nothing at all, because they are trying to establish the rebellion, gather their tropes, find out more information how to raise the wards etc. So it deals with the characters getting to class and learning about magic etc. While a lot of people still die in this book, Iron Flame just didn’t feel as high staked imo as Fourth Wing did. Violet and her friends survived all the trials and first year, so I didn’t feel like I was constantly on the edge of my seat not knowing what will happen next. Don’t get me wrong there were many scenes that HAD ME STRESSED OUT and sweating, because it was intense, but it wasn’t intense as a whole as Fourth Wing and didn’t me give me as much nostalgia as Fourth Wing did.↠ theinfo-dumpingwas a bit much in this book. I think Fourth Wing had the perfect amount of world building and information. Iron Flame had a lot of information because the characters are going to class and learn about new magic and trying to gather info on how to raise wards and power the wardstone etc. and I get that it was important, but seeing them look for information, just to try it and fail and then having to continue their search was a bit exhausting.↠ some of the themes in this book were repetitive. Since Violet and Xaden couldn’t see each other a lot in the first half of the book I ate up every scenes they had together, but the things they were fighting over were always the same.. Violet not being able to trust him, them not being able to proper communicate with each other, Violet complaining about Xaden lying and having too many secrets .. that was pretty much the root of every single fight they had. Their push and pull was a bit tiring to read at the beginning cause they had the same argument over and over again.CONCLUSIONFourth Wing was a perfect book for me and a 10 outta 10 so even though Iron Flame didn’t reach that level for me and had quite some flaws, it was still an enjoyable book to read and I love love love this world so much with the dragon and magic and harry potter vibes. I love this series and after that brutal ending I need the next book in my hands right now. Praying that we don’t have to wait a whole year for the next book to come out.P.S: What is the author going to write in the next THREE books?! We are already in the middle of fighting against the venin and wyvern and I hope RY doesn’t drag out the storyline too much and makes it another Zodiac Academy situation 💀┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑THE EMPYREAN SERIES#1 Fourth Wing –\xa05 stars#2Iron Flame–\xa04 stars┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '0/5 ⭐️ you thought Fourth Wing was bad…? Oh you sweet summer child.Goodreads has been real finicky about reviews recently so I will only be speaking on the book and its content (not the author though I have very many opinions (none of them kind☺️))also there are spoilers in this review but who cares because you shouldn’t be reading this book to begin with! (Don’t let my sacrifice be in vain)I intended to get this review out way sooner but unfortunately (and unsurprisingly) this book was actually so much worse than Fourth Wing!🥳I naively assumed Fourth Wing would be the top contender for worst book of the year but Iron Flame made me wish I was reading Fourth Wing!!At least Fourth Wing had the decency to be short enough to get through in a week, Iron Flame takes every flaw of Fourth Wing and not only makes it worse but makes it LONGER(???!?!) while somehow simultaneously being even more boring! Wow!🤩 Good job Yarros!!! What a fantasy icon!!🧝🏻\u200d♀️Remember how Fourth Wing had one of the most idiotic, and juvenile writing styles in any adult fantasy book ever? Imagine that but now in a world where editing was never invented!! 🥰The sentence structure was legitimately horrendous. I actually wish I was kidding.If you have the unfortunate displeasure of being in a twenty mile radius of a copy of Iron Flame and are unlucky enough to stroll past it in the store or your local library, I beg you, after you recover from the sheer horror of being in the same room as such an abomination to fantasy, open it to a random page and just ATTEMPT to read a paragraph out loud.I am a creative writing major, I read books out loud all the time. I have never struggled so much with a book in my entire life. Sincerely whoever had to do the audio book must have the endurance and the mental fortitude of a saint.Forgive me, Yarros, for believing reading should be an enjoyable experience, clearly you do not agree. 🧎\u200d♀️Also Yarros used 493 ellipses and 1089 em-dashes on my count! The book is about 634 pages!💫And oh! A Drinking game🥂: take a shot every time a character’s eyebrow or brow or brows are mentioned!! Actually don’t! You’d definitely die! Brows are mentioned over a hundred times!!🫠 I have to laugh (or else I might scream) at the idea that THIS is accessible fantasy because not only is the plot and the world building convoluted and unengaging but the writing is so incredibly shit that it makes you reread half of the sentences over again if you want to the vaguest inkling of an idea of what is going on in this horseshit world. To call Iron Flame accessible spits in the face of twenty plus years of hard work and effort by truly talented authors to make fantasy books that are actually welcoming and accessible to a wide audience.Let’s actually talk about the plot. Fourth Wing was derivative and predictable and Iron Flame doesn’t even try to be any more.Here’s a list of some 🌈✨creative😍 plot points Yarros used:- A shitty copycat version of the Hunger Game’s rebellion (with zero of the interesting nuance or intelligent discourse)😯- what is essentially a boring Umbridge at a half-assed attempt to create tension😧- The Rider Quadrant and the Infantry Quadrant finally interact!! They are dropped in the middle of a forest, are being hunted by dragons, and are given two maps and told to go to a location marked on the maps! A simple assignment for students at a war school who surely know how to navigate using a map because that’s an important skill for soldiers to know, right?! 🗺️ Not only do these riders not learn how to read a map until year two (WHY?) but apparently the Infantry and Riders hate each other so much😠 that THEY DON’T EVEN COMPARE THE TWO MAPS WHEN PEOPLE HAVE CONFLICTING IDEAS ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE. THEY WALK AROUND IN A FOREST FOR HOURS INSTEAD OF COLLABORATING ONCE. I don’t care how much you hate someone at school, if you are given a group assignment literally step one is compare all documents you have been given so you can be done as quickly as possible. ALSO WHEN ONE OF THE INFANTRY ASKS TO WHAT TO SO IN THE EVEN OF A DRAGON ATTACK THE RIDERS LAUGH AND MAKE FUN OF THEM FOR BEING SCARED??? THEN WHEN A DRAGON ATTACKS THE RIDERS ARE MAD AT THE INFANTRY FOR DOING THE WRONG THING AFTER THEY LITERALLY WERE NOT TOLD WHAT TO DO!! Yarros when I find you Yarros Yarros when I find you Yarros🏃\u200d♀️🏃\u200d♀️- Jack Barlow back because I guess Yarros couldn’t come up with another new antagonist… also he’s Venin for reasons. Really it’s not that interesting. The resurrection trope is so fun!!🤩🤗- A torture scene summary that is not scary in the slightest because this book conditions you to know that Violet is never in any real danger despite trying to tell you she is always on the verge of death 😱- A visit to what is essentially the Summer Court in search the Book of some bullshit thing called a luminary (btw we don’t even know what it looks like until 60% through the book AFTER they’ve acquired it???)🤫- a catty ex-girlfriend (named Cat, wow ✨creative✨) making a reappearance and doing nothing but promotes wonderful stereotypes (even though Yarros tries really hard to tell you it doesn’t on page the literal page)💃🏻- and the most anticlimactic and boring battle with the dumbest ending I’ve ever read!! 🤺There are more stupid plot points, but I’m getting brain damage trying to remember the plot of this book so I’m just going to talk about things that made me wish I was attempting to consume whole boulders rather than read the most accessible fantasy book of all time: Iron Flame by Rebecca Yarros😇Varrish. He’s our Umbridge lookalike. He strolls into the Dragon Rider Academy and he’s super scary with his one-eyed dragon Solas!!! 😰I mean he would have been, but literally the first time he does anything scary by letting his dragon incinerate an entire squad, TAIRN FLYS IN AND THREATENS SOLAS. AND SOLAS AND VARRISH BOTH COWER BECAUSE TAIRN IS SO BIG AND SUPER SCARY AND THE 🌈✨⭐️MoST PoWErFuL⭐️✨🌈 DraGOn😀Well maybe this is understandable because Solas just killed like twenty people, right?🤔 But no! Tairn isn’t mad about that, he’s mad because Violet got like a first degree burn.I don’t know what Yarros was attempting to achieve with this scene but you know what it does achieve? It tells the reader that Varrish isn’t actually a scary villain because having Tairn put him in his place the moment he does a single villainous action. IT DESTROYS ALL TENSION YOU COULD HAVE HAD.🧍🏻\u200d♀️And don’t you worry, dearest reader, this is a trend. LATER TAIRN MAKES VARRISH GET ON HIS KNEES AND APOLOGIZE TO VIOLET FOR BEING MEAN TO HER. ⁉️⁉️IN FACT ANYTIME ANYONE IS MEAN TO VIOLET THE ENTIRE WORLD COMES TO HER DEFENSE. Any character, any dragon, I swear to god a speck of dust could land on Violet wrong and the entire cast of characters would jump them. And it’s not just her friends. THE SIDE CHARACTERS, MAIN CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS WITH LITERALLY A SINGLE LINE OF DIALOGUE, MINOR AND MAIN ANTAGONISTS.THEY ALL COMPLIMENT VIOLETC O N S T A N T L Y.VARRISH COMPLIMENTS HER, THE VENIN COMPLIMENT HER, CAT COMPLIMENTS HER.Sloane (the sister of Liam, the stupid dead guy👱🏻\u200d♂️ that Violet tries to convince us was her friend) says the most benign of comments against Violet and Rhiannon and every other personality-devoid lampshade of a character in a seven mile vicinity practically threatens to jump this GRIEVING 20 year old girl.Characters that Violet doesn’t even know will compliment her out of the blue.THE BOOK READS LIKE AN INSECURE PERSON WISH FUFILLMENT. 💇\u200d♀️It’s so unbelievably unbearable. 👹The Violet Defense Squad™️ is literally in every chapter. My favorite part about this book was that I couldn’t find a chapter where Violet isn’t complimented for doing literally nothing in any of all 66 chapters of the entire book.🤭🤩And in case you were concerned that anyone who was mean to Violet would get interesting character development, nope! They either end up dead or want to be her friend by the end🥰 awesome!😎 Violet is my favorite character😍Are you interested in Violet’s character arc? Well let me tell you the wonderful highs of this perfect character that we’re supposed to root for and support!!😘Violet starts out strong by making insane demands of Xaden like demanding he tell her literally everything even though she had her mind read last book! And she doesn’t just mention this once. She mentions this every single time we see Xaden. She doesn’t trust him, she tells us, but she loves him, she tells us. 🙄 They’re such a cute and believable and interesting couple 🥰🥰 and their dynamic is made so much better by that random ex-girlfriend that was included because Yarros got bored I guess!😍On top of being annoying and insecure, Violet decided that this book she would also double down on being one the worst people imaginable! Remember when all those people Violet considered friends died in her first year and she was so sad about that?Well actually this book Violet tells us that she’s gained some new perspective!!🤯Actually she’s glad all those people died because watching all those people die made her a better rider because they inspired her to… not die(?)! Because that’s a normal and morally good thing for our main character that is SO empathetic and SO kind to say!🙈 Violet is so good, I wish I was just like her!!!☺️Also remember Sloane and her dead brother?!👱🏻\u200d♂️ Well Liam spent all of book one writing letters to Sloane, his only living family! Wouldn’t it be so nice if Violet gave those to Sloane out of the kindness and goodness of her heart to help Sloane cope with the loss of her older brother?!😊 Well she didn’t!!Violet withheld the letters for weeks after Sloane arrived at the school, (weeks in which Sloane very well could have died by the way) and only offered to give Sloane the letters if she agreed to train with Imogen (a girl Sloane does not like) and only agreed to give her one letter a week!! There are over fifty letters Violet! What happens if Sloane dies during a freak accident which you KNOW are rampant at this death school???! Violet is such an empath guys🥺 she really understands and cares for the people around her.😣 Don’t you wish you were just like her?!😁Violet also does a variety of things such as:- Dropping a gryphon flier off the side of a cliff and then being surprised when said gryphon flier’s friends don’t like her? Inspirational💫- Talking shit on the infantry for not trusting dragons and being cowards after literally being a prime example as to why the infantry should not trust riders or their dragons! So empathetic🥺- Wanting to murder Xaden’s ex for saying a couple of barely mean comments to her! A totally rational response!!!👍- Trying to translate a journal from a dead language she doesn’t know (she does know many other dead languages, of course) instead of giving it to the girl that she’s knows understands that dead language! Wow! the smartest main character of our generation! 🤯- Accusing every scholar and student of the school of perpetuating misinformation and hiding history that she herself just found out about! She’s so kind and thoughtful 🥳- Forgetting instantly about her friend who got her neck snapped after some assassin asked who Violet Sorrengail was. She cares so much about her friends!👯\u200d♀️- And many, many more abhorrent things🤩In case you forgot (because apparently Yarros did 90% of the book) Violet has EDS. Sometimes it’s brought up, but not really with any substance. And Violet just wraps her joints and “pushes through it” and “puts all her pain into a box” (??) and pretends she doesn’t have a problem at all. No further accommodations are granted to her in this book aside from the saddle from last book which is already dumb because everyone trying to hold onto a flying creature should be using saddles anyway.I highly suggest: Fly Or Die: The Ableist Narrative of Toxic Perseverance by Ella T Holmes for a much better explanation than I can provide as someone that doesn’t have EDS.Let’s talk about Xaden because if I have to think about how super special and powerful and amazing Violet is I might eat all the gravel in my backyard. Xaden’s depiction in this book is gross to say the least.Rebecca has confirmed that he’s a PoC which is great!Keeping that in mind, I love how he’s described as incapable of love and is called a monster and is untrustworthy!!😍😍And I absolutely adore that our super special and talented basic white girl Violet is the person that shows him true love and trust and is the only person who can take his mask of cruelty and violence off for the first time even though she’s so much smaller and weaker than big, strong, powerful Xaden. It’s so cool that all the other characters are so terrified of him and that he acts as little more than Violet’s big overprotective and jealous guard dog! I especially love that Violet’s mom practically tortured him and gave him a hundred and something scars and that he has to take responsibility for all of the marked ones!! That’s not concerning and horrific!!!! And I love that he also got another scar for “claiming” Violet!! that’s so attractive and romantic and good representation and not at all fetishizing men of color at all!!!🥰🥰🥰 Thank you so much for your hard work Yarros!!!🫡He’s also annoying and refuses to tell Violet anything unless she asks hyper specific questions. Their whole dynamic is just annoying and stupid.And I love all of Yarros’ other characters who have less personality than paper bags with faces drawn on them!!🪑 Frankly a folding chair has more charm than any of the characters in this book.They’re so unique and are definitely really funny and don’t ever bog down the scenes with so many characters that you can’t tell who is even talking anymore! They’re all unique and dynamic with character arcs!! Of course! What else would they be?😆And the dragons! 🐉 Oh the dragons! How could I forget about the dragons that are nothing but glorified Uber rides!! They don’t do shit but posture and growl and be boring!Here’s some fun facts about dragons: dragons can choose their tail shape but they can’t choose their color which directly influences their personality and temperament!!All baby dragons are gold because that’s interesting! Is there an evolutionary reason for that or something? Not that we’re told of!More dragon sex is mentioned, thankfully we don’t have to live through the dragon-lust again though!Also the dismounts that Rebecca describes the Riders doing are literally physically impossible!! All the riders should be dead if they try to pull that shit! Giant flying dragons are not horses you can’t just walk around on it while it’s diving and jump off of it😭😭Oh and Anadarna also is now like a super special purple/chameleon never before seen breed of dragon with the rarest tail shape!🐲 Are we surprised? No. Just bored. 😴She also now has like a disabled/malformed wing. Her wings were fine in the first book, but now they’re not? Idk. I feel like that should have been a thing in book one but whatever. (Tairn literally blames it on Violet which is sort of hilariously fucked up??) But anyway she obviously can still fly because god forbid a disability ever hinder a character in anyway that makes them adapt, but she can’t ever hold a rider? Violet is like 90 pounds as we are so graciously reminded so I feel like if Andarna gets bigger she definitely should be able to carry her but whatever. 🤷\u200d♀️TLDR: the dragons are BORING. And they’re not even funny or cool or even scary. Why write about dragons if you make them boring and insignificant to the plot??! And Andarna is a special-special because of course she is. 🤪This review is getting way too long so let’s just talk about the ending.Oh no! Violet’s mom that got no real development or anything died! Anyway. 🧐Why the fuck did the revolution refuse to help Navarre? They claim to be morally superior and to care about the lives of civilians but just blatantly ignore like 50% of the continent’s population because they’re Navarre citizens? And we’re supposed to root for them? Right! Awesome! Okay!😆👍What are the actual morals of the revolution? What is their end goal? Why did Violet join them so quickly without asking any questions??🫠She’s so intelligent!🤓I’m completely fine with Xaden becoming Venin, though I doubt it will be resolved in an interesting way. Though I don’t think it’s really an interesting plot twist and I saw it coming a mile away after all the boring Venin info dumping I had to sit through, but at least it’s something.HOWEVER I CANNOT FORGIVE IT FOR MAKING THE FINAL LINES OF THE BOOK“Welcome to our fucked-up family. Guess we’re brothers now.”THE SECOND TO LAST LINE IN THE BOOK IS “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”😭😭😭😭😭WHAT WHAT WHATDO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT DID TO ME??I READ 634 PAGES OF THE WORST, MEANDERING, BULLSHIT PLOT POINTS, HORRIFIC AND BORING SEX SCENES, INDECIPHERABLE INFO DUMPS, NONSENSICAL MAGIC SYSTEMS, FLAT CHARACTERS, BORING DRAGONS, HORRIBLE REPRESENTATION, AGGRESSIVELY UNFUNNY FRAT BOY HUMOR, UNEDITED GARBAGE AND YOU END IT WITH “WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY”???????????????!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!!?!??!ARE YOU TRYING TO GIVE ME A JOKER ARC??? WAS THAT THE POINT OF THIS BOOK????AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY AS AN ACTUAL FANTASY BOOK???THE REASON THIS BOOK TOOK ME SO LONG TO REVIEW IS BECAUSE I GOT ACTUAL PSYCHIC DAMAGE FROM THE LAST LINES OF THIS BOOK.I HYPERVENTILATED I THREW MY PHONE I SCREAMED I STARED AT A WALL AND CONTEMPLATED MY PLACE AND PURPOSE ON THIS EARTHI HAD MORE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THAN ANY CHARACTER IN THIS ENTIRE BOOK IN THE 0.5 SECONDS AFTER READING THOSE LINESHOW AM I SUPPOSED TO REACT TO THAT??DID YARROS THINK SHE ACCOMPLISHED SOMETHING WITH THAT ENDING??HAVE I LOST MY MIND?? PEOPLE LIKE THIS BOOK? PEOPLE TAKE IT SERIOUSLY AND MAKE UP THEORIES FOR IT??? WHAT??????GENUINELY IF YOU LIKE THIS BOOK WHY? WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? ARE YOU OKAY? DO YOU NEED HELP?WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY??? GUESS WE’RE BROTHERS NOW???YARROS I AM LIVING IN YOUR WALLS WHAT DO YOU MEAN WELCOME TO OUR FUCKED UP FAMILY WHAT DO YOU MEAN😭😭😭😭😭😭I FEEL LIKE I AM ENTITLED TO FINANCIAL COMPENSATION FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE THIS BOOK HAS INFLICTED UPON MEso thanks for reading my review <3 I hope this helps your decision making process when it comes to buying books :) (don’t buy this book) Yarros did not receive any financial compensation for my suffering and I highly recommend that if you want to read this book (for some reason??? Why?? I spent so long writing this to give you reasons not to!😭) you get it from your library or literally any other means.Red Tower and Yarros are not people that deserve your hard earned money or support.Also whoever the fuck claimed to have edited this book is a world class scammer because they got paid for doing literally nothing. But also they should be fired and exiled and never allowed to look at words again.I have more to say but I hit the word limit💀'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Because love, at its root, is hope. Hope for tomorrow. Hope for what could be. Hope that someone you've entrusted your everything to will cradle and protect it. And hope? That shit is harder to kill than a dragon.Well, fuck🥲That being said, I promised myself I'd finish my current readings before starting this one, but FoMo was a bitch and then, would you believe that, I tripped and fell into Xadaddy's arms.Silly, clumsy me.Iron Flame was alright, but I'm not crazy about it.I found the writing even more YAish than it was in Fourth Wing and I, painfully, have to admit I feel the same about the romance.I don't know if maybe, when I first read Fourth Wing, I was in a place, mentally speaking, where my reader needs were more than met despite the flaws, but it seems like I can't overlook them with the sequel.Being completely honest, the plot does pick up after the first half and the romance has its up and downs all through the story, but it never reaches the point where I felt like giving up on it completely.The smut was fine and the tension well written, but I'm not a fan of Yarros's idea of spicy dialogues.The one liners, sometimes, made me cringe a little, and the characterization of the main characters left me a tad confused, at times, especially at the beginning. I couldn't follow the story properly because I felt like Violet was thinking one thing then acting in a completely opposite way.Speaking of Violet...When I read FW, I thought Yarros'd made her a bit of a Mary Sue, but that was okay, because she had obvious flaws, even she was aware of, to balance her randomly having every special skill on the menu and succeding in every single task she was burdened with.Iron Flame Violet is a total badass and she's definitely grown a lot, but she also feels a little incomplete and rough at the edges. I don't know if it's intentional and/or tied to her future evolution, but I wouldn't have minded her being more confident, especially when it comes to her relationship with Xaden.Xaden is still daddy, in case you're asking, and he was a total dreamboat, the ultimate book boyfriend from start to finish.Like I've mentioned before, I wasn't really sure about the romance, at first. I wanted more grovelling and Violet's constant thirsting over Xaden's fine behind gave me a headache. It gave me major early Tory/Darius vibes, and if you're a fan of Zodiac Academy, you'll get what I mean.Thankfully, things took a pleasant turn when I reached the second part and I wasn't only rooting for them, I was absolutely feral when everything mined their eventual happiness.This works for the plot as well. In the first half, I wasn't really enjoying myself and could count on one hand the moments I actually found interesting.But then shit hit the fan, twists started piling up and every page turned was an angsty fest I totally wanted to attend. I devoured the second half in hours and when I reached the end, just felt like staring at the wall.And have a mojito or two.I definitely didn't see THAT coming.Another thing I really appreciated, aside from the chef's kiss perfect action scenes and THE SASSY DRAGONS (omg my baby Andarna!!!), were the secondary characers. Violet and Xaden's friends deserve their own books - Rhi in particular <3<3<3< - and I definitely hope the sequels will focus on them more, especially because some characters are only now starting to blossom and they seem particularly interesting.I also would like to take advantage of this topic to admit I never really hated Dain. I'm pretty passive when it comes to him, but I swear to god, if RY takesthatdirection, I'm gonna throw a fit.Overall, this was, for me, a decent sequel, albeit an unnecessarily long one.If you loved FW but are having trouble with it like I did, I recommend pushing through it.All in all, it's pretty worth it.I'll leave under the spoiler tag some sort of disclaimer because, even though I usually try my best to stay clear of any kind of drama and hate brining real life politics into my bookish heaven, I've been harassed for a couple days both in public and in private because of my choice to give this book a chance, so for the first and last time in my permanence here on this site, I'll go out of my usual way and discuss things I usually never discuss on GR, after all.I'm aware of the controversy surrounding this author and this book series.I'm not ignoring the problem, I'm simply choosing to keep my thoughts on the matter private and my general beliefs silent, except for serious situations that require me to speak up about them out loud or environments where I know judgement or opposition would come in a respectful manner and not in the form of bullying and name calling.Unfortunately, that doesn't always seem to be the case here on GR, these days.I'm publicly choosing to read this book acknowledging what's going on behind the scenes, and my review will simply be that: an objective and honest book review like the hundreds I've written before, as my hobby and favorite pastime.It won't nor shouldn't be my opinion telling others what they can or can't, should or shouldn't read in their free time and how to use their money or to consume the media they purchased.If I had that type of influence, I most certainly wouldn't be spending my spare moments reviewing books for free.Iam choosing, for myself, to leave a review that has nothing to do with the person who wrote this book or her political views, and it's between me, my objectivity and my conscience to decide how this will play out.I don't need to state this, but before anyone starts throwing around terms and essays, my support and prayers go out to people who are suffering. I chose to do something about the delicate and important matters we're discussing (and those conflicts and natural catastrophes I rarely see discussed here, because, guess what? 1) it's GoodREADS not GoodWORLDWIDENEWS and 2) the world sucks everywhere and it's been sucking for a really long time), but you won't hear me being vocal about it, because I've learnt you don't have to boast about your actions and contributions to be a good person. That sometimes those who are lousy and loud with words, just like the idea of being good without really acting on it.I'm choosing to help whoever I feel needs helping in a way that's suited to my personal beliefs and that has nothing to do with the books I prefer to engage with.I'm choosing to remain neutral when it comes to sharing political views on a site dedicated to book tracking; war and death are a reality I'll never turn away from.And if separating art from the artist isn't a tolerated choice, I hope keeping my private life and my reader life separate will be more understandable.I hope those who disagree with my choice to refrain from sharing my political views, will give me the benefit of the doubt, as I'll try to do with them and their ideals.If you wanna talk politics or discuss what an author has or hasn't done, my comment section isn't the place. If you also wanna unfriend/unfollow me for this or because any of my reading/life choices make you uncomfortable, please go ahead. No hard feelings on my part, really. It'll be sad to see some I considered close friends go, but I understad.

Not that this one wasn\'t great, but it didn\'t give the same feelings as the first one did when it hooked me instantly because of the Parapet scene.Many things didn\'t work for me.The start of this book wasn\'t as exciting... (she was eating freaking biscuits). And Brennan\'s revealation and all were just so avg and boring? A lot of info dumps too. The Dragons made this book better.The first 30% of this book is filled with \'You don\'t trust me enough\' drama between Xaden and Vi, which was seriously getting on my nerves.I get that she\'s hurt, but she was being absolutely ridiculous, demanding info while withholding it as a form of retaliation. Her inner monologue about being a \'bad friend\' and always \'feeling guilty\' for lying again and again was constantly on repeat. NO ACTION NOTHING NADA. I felt bad for Rhiannon as she tried again and again and always checked up on her. Rhiannon deserved better! 😭🔪SPOILERS:🔪So, I\'ll start with my fav,—TAIRN CARRIED THIS WHOLE BOOK. PERIOD. He\'s so damn possessive, and I\'m dying at how powerful and protective he is of Violet! He\'s so freaking savage, I can write so much about him! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS DRAGON 😌💕“You do not have the right to burn what is mine.”“Apologize,” Tairn demands, his voice low and sharp. “I’m sorry!” Varrish’s voice breaks. “Apologize to the one Andarna deemed worthy of her bond.""“I chose you last year for that brilliance, and now you’d like to be congratulated like it’s something new? How odd.” “You’re impossible to impress.” “I’m a dragon, a Black Morningstartail. The descendant of—”—Tairn\'s and Andarna\'s banter was so fun ughhhhh I really enjoyed that!!!! 🥹 Both are so sarcastic and witty now! Andarna my cutieeee 🤭“Scratch her eyes out,” Andarna suggests. “Really. The eyes are the softest tissue. Just jab your thumbs in there—” “Andarna! Use some common sense,” Tairn snaps. “The kneecaps are a much easier target.”“Can you carry a luminary?” “That question insults me.” “Can you carry a luminary while insulted?” she prods”""Adolescent.""—How can I not fall for Xaden when he says things like:“She’s worth a dozen of me.""“I will happily watch Aretia burn to the fucking ground again if it means you live.""“I’m in love with you. I have been since the night the snow fell in your hair and you kissed me for the first time. I’m grateful my life is tied to yours because it means I won’t have to face a day without you in it. My heart only beats as long as yours does, and when you die, I’ll meet Malek at your side.—I\'m dying at how much Dain is roasted in this book! 💀 It\'s like the author read all of our reviews about him.“He’s trying desperately for Xaden’s charisma and coming up woefully short”“Garrick has always been my best friend. His father was my father’s aide, which in a way makes him my Dain, except trustworthy”“He’s not slowing down,” I murmur. Part of me hopes Dain falls off.”Me when Jack mf Barlowe entered:jdkskdhaha please he had no business pretending to be kind 😭 I was cackling! like IMAGINE a nice jack barlowe? *snort*. A wise man once said, ""once a bitch, always a bitch""TOXICITY AT ITS PEAK:Xaden and Violet went from being a couple who support each other to being borderline toxic. They were restricted to meet only two days, and it was spent fighting! THEY FOUGHT AT EVERY CHANCE THEY GOT!""you didn\'t tell.""""you didn\'t ask.""THIS SHOULD BE THE BLURB. This freaking drama grated on my nerves, and I was tired of how much this phrase was used. LIKE STOP? Everybody knew that Xaden is not sharing everything just to protect her life, and to a certain extent, I understand Violet, and I agree with her.but she\'s being so immature and whiny, and I swear this book just kind of ruined her character in many ways because she was always back to this old topic, and they constantly fought each other, and Violet constantly defied Xaden again and again (as in risking her life) and then made up eventually.The author really tried to put angst into their story with smut, but tbh I DO NOT PREFER THEM AS A COUPLE (at least not rn). The love was too quick, and the amount of trust issues, insecurities, and fights they had was so wrong and unhealthy. Xaden was being protective of her and hiding truths from her for her OWN SAFETY! and saying from experience, fantasy girlies do not like overprotective bfs. AND ADDING CATRIONA IN IT? That was the worst! The whole ex-jealousy thing was insane. and if this keeps going on, I don\'t think XadenVi will be the endgame (there are 5 books ffs)• side characters:For me,Rhiannonstole the show. She\'s so mature and amazing? and I love her sm! How she kept calm and been patient and supported Violet, and she\'s so damn skillful? SHE DESERVED APPRECIATION AND I\'M GLAD SHE GOT IT. She\'s super genius and literally figured most of the things out and told Violet that \'she\'ll wait for her to tell her everything\' like GURLLLLL 🥺🥰🤭💕Dain\'sreasoning was prettyyy... reasonable? I knew and already predicted what he would say, and it turned out I was correct! I liked his redemption arc though and realized that I cursed him way too much 😂 ok, Dain, you can be back on my okay-ish list. and HE HAD NO RIGHT TO COPY XADEN\'S LINES 💀AARIC GRAYCASTLEY\'ALL (not his real name but will do) jekdjs he\'s so hot? 😭 GREEN EYES ARE A BIG WEAKNESS, and I truly see him getting bigger parts in the other books cuz duh he\'s so freaking amazing and .... royal. He\'s the next Liam 🥹 (sans the death part). HE CARES FOR VIOLET TOO, DADDY ISSUES AND IS CUTIEEE! I low-key ship him and Violet together hhahahaha and pls no sloaneAaric.Sloanewas seriously just different than Liam lol! I expected too much, but she was not that important in this book besides Violet constantly checking up on her. Ngl some scenes/hallucinations of Liam made me so happy and sad. 🥹Rodichdkejs he\'s so good, and his character damn he\'s actually pretty amazing! I\'m glad his character got recognized a lot in this book!Varrishsoooo weirddd sooo creepyyyyy! 👺 I hated him so much and what he did with Violet? HE DESERVED A PAINFUL DEATH WTH! I loved when he begged violet on his knees like bishhhh you deserve that.General SorrengailMOTHER. 🫡 The quote where she told her husband THAT EVERYTHING SHE EVER DID WAS JUST TO SAVE HER CHILDREN! 💔“Most generals dream of dying in service to their kingdom. But you know me better than that, my love.When I fall, it will be for one reason only: to protect our children.”Now, all said, I truly think that this book was too long, and a lot of things were super tough and descriptive like: runes...?what the fuck were those? I read many times and I came with a seizure because why are they even added? A second reread would help, but I won\'t go there anytime soon. A lot of elements of this book were so weird that I prefer book 1 A LOT!what the actual fuckery?(the ending ofcourse)I can finally sleep now as I haven\'t slept more than 5 hours just to finish this book.I\'m sorry but I didn\'t know about this author being zionist when I read this book and I didnt contribute to her financially and all as I read the pirated version. I\'m not supporting gen0cide at all!RATINGS:• Fourth Wing– 5 stars• Iron Flame – 3.75 stars• Onyx Storm– tbr'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""|| 2.0 stars ||Well, damn. This was incredibly disappointing...I don’t even really know where to start with this review, because I feel like I have so many complaints.First and foremost, let’s start with one of the book’s most glaring issues: the writing was genuinelybad. It’s as plain and simple as that. This whole thing dragged like crazy and I was just so bored most of the time. Not only that, the writing was also painfully shallow. Nothing and no one had depth: all of the characters were completely one-dimensional and the plot failed to be interesting or engaging in any way.Speaking of the characters, let’s go on with my complaints by talking about our failure of a main character. I don’t know what happened to Violet between this one and the previous book, but I don’t recognize her whatsoever. She used to be the perfect balance of kind and bad-ass with a clever and sharp mind to boot! But now this girl we all knew and loved disappeared completely and instead we got this whiny, insecure idiot without a single rational thought going on inside that annoying brain of hers. I suddenly couldn’t stand her anymore!Same goes for Xaden: he suffered from major character assassination as well. He used to be strong, smart, mysterious, intriguing, and swoony as hell, but that was all gone now. Xaden turned into the most flat character ever, and he had no depth whatsoever. He truly felt like a robot to me, and I lost all interest in him. He is gone for most of the book, and at first I really missed his presence, but after a while, I was just bored every time he came on page, because I knew he would be the same repetitive and annoying character he was during all his other scenes, so I kind of didn’t care anymore if he was gone or not.The fact that both Violet and Xaden turned into insufferable characters is probably a big reason as to why their romance was terrible in this book too. First of all, after the end of the first book Ineededto get some groveling from Xaden, but did we get that here? No. Not even for a second. Xaden wasn’t sorry, he wasn’t regretful, he wasn’t trying to earn back Violet’s trust. No. He didn’t do anything. He didn’t even fight for Violet to forgive him. He was just... waiting. Not lifting a single finger to get back the woman he supposedly loves. He was so cocky in knowing that Violet would crawl back to him anyway that he refused to do anything to speed up the process. He just waited. And I guess he was right, because our spine-less heroine did indeed take him back without getting anything in return: no promises, no trust. Just nothing.Which obviously leads to a very unhealthy relationship between them where they don’t trust each other and in which they refuse to communicate. EVER. All they do is be horny and have sex, but they never actually talk anymore. They don’t confide in each other and neither do they let themselves fully open up to the other. Their entire relationship was just shallow, boring and irritating. I no longer liked anything about it. And then we even got some goddamn other woman drama, and my patience just vanished! I hated it.Now, when it comes to the side characters I don’t even know where to begin, because I feel like none of them were written well or with any depth to them. It’s like the author could never seem to focus on more than a few characters at the same time, so whenever she wanted to pay attention to one side character, all the other side characters just fell away. For example: at the beginning of this book we have quite a lot of focus on Imogen, and I was really seeing some amazing progress between her and Violet. I thought I saw the start of a beautiful friendship forming between them. But then, the moment Rhiannon started coming back into the fold (after being ignored in the first part), Imogen completely fell away again and her relationship with Violet never picked up. It’s like the author couldn’t handle Violet having more than one close female friend; she couldn’t focus on both at the same time. And therefore, neither Imogen or Rhiannon ever truly felt like friends to Violet because they were often suddenly ignored in her inner monologue or in the story. They were more like decoration, like tools to further the story along. Thus, none of Violet’s friends ever feel like real characters on their own..I loved the dragons in the first book; they were my favourite part of the entire book. But now, I couldn’t care less. Tairn used to be this sassy, grumpy dad-type, but now he was just a flat, monotone character with no real personality. Everything he said was repetitive, and his entire character just seemed way too simple and lacking any sort of depth. When it came to Andarna, I genuinely think her entire character was butchered. She used to be this cute and precious little baby, and now she turned into someone annoying, bitchy and arrogant without any meaningful connection to Violet. She was like an entitled teenager, and there’s a reason why nobody likes those.Of course, there were also other characters of whom I was really looking forward to seeing their story develop, but I didn’t get anything remotely satisfying when it came to them. Liam’s sister was only in a few scenes and in most of them she was just flat-out exasperating; everything about her character was anti-climactic.More importantly however, I feel like Dain just got completely ignored during this entire book. He used to be Violet’s best friend for such a long time and after it is revealed he didn’t even really do anything to betray her, Violet doesn’t remotely seem to care?? She doesn’t think about him and she doesn’t give him the time of day... she sort of forgives him but not really?? It was so weakly developed and I honestly expected more. It was, once again, very anti-climactic.Long story short, the only reason I somewhat enjoyed this book, and why I even finished it, is because I still felt a semblance of attachment to the story and these characters after book one, but even that wasn’t enough to keep me engaged for long enough. I couldn’t help but skim near the end of this book, because I was just so bored. I genuinely didn’t care anymore, and this book was just way too long for no reason. All in all, this was one big disappointment to me.'The Empyrean' series:1.Fourth Wing- 4.5 stars2.

I just want to read in peace.LET\'S START WITH THE REVIEW""Trust me yet?""""With my life.""🫠🫠After having some time to recollect my thoughts, I do believe that in no way this was a perfect book. Yet it was so enjoyable and exciting. I loved it in all its imperfections. Xaden and Violet have my heart and the series seems to be getting darker and more powerful. But oh how I ate it all up 🤭Was it better than Fourth Wing?The plot certainly was better but I do think people will find its execution a bit messy in general.Is it binge worthy?Absolutely, you just need time.So A LOT happens in this one, in fact way more than the first book.This book is so action packed and relationship focused, I didn\'t think I could love this series more but I really do.The best part about this was Tairn and Andarna. No one can tell me otherwise. I came in to love Xaden and Violet but the dragons... AHHHH 😩😩❤The book picks up immediately after the events of Fourth Wing and with no time wasted we jump into the story. Iliked the addition of new charactersand the way they all had their own personalities yet never overpowering.Felixand his sarcastic arse was top notch. I liked how he kept things real. I do believe the transition ofSolane\'sissues with Violet could have been smoothened a bit considering how strong she came to be. I absolutely LOATHEDVarrish.He\'s the equivalent of Umbridge I swear. Hated, hated, hated him. Those who have read Fourth Wing know, am not mentioning one of the characters, but I\'ll just say- his dynamic with Violet was chef\'s kiss 🤌""I want you exactly how you are, emotions and all. I want the woman I fell for...""🩶I lovedXadenand Violet.The groveling and reassurance THROUGHOUT the book was everything!!So we all know how things were left in Fourth Wing, and I expected Xaden to grovel his way for a few pages but our girl Violet made him grovel the whole time and I LOVED it. He was patient with her, he took his time with her. He made mistakes in this one too but he owned up to it and gave her answers.❤️\u200d🔥She had 100 questions? He answered them all. She asked the same question a million times? He answered it each and every damn time. Someone tried to make her jealous? He confidently claimed and assured her every time. Yeah, exactly! That\'s the kind of man he is 🤭😌⚡I adoredVioletin this. Let\'s be honest, there will be a lot of people who will find her annoying and insecure in this one. I personally did not. To me it made sense. Everyone lied to her throughout her whole life. Almost every new person wants to kill her. She lost someone very close to her. Her issues with Cat although wasn\'t really necessary but made sense. It gave Xaden and Violet the opportunity to become confident in each other and gave the opportunity to trust each other again. I loved Violet was patient and open towards Xaden, well eventually 🤭🐉Now let\'s get tomy babies- Tairn and Andarna.Y\'all if you adored them in the last book? You will LOVE them in this. Tairn was his sarcastic self, caring self and always giving his Silver One wisdom. I absolutely LOVED Andarna. Her adolescent self was so snarky, it was adorable. I wanted to protect them both, and especially my baby Andarna. Her reveals(Yes, multiple reveals 👀)had me gasping. I can\'t wait to see what else is in store for them.🔥Theside characters- Ridoc, Sawyer, Imogen and Rhiwere such good friends. The way they supported Violet through thick and thin. They had each other\'s backs. Sawyer and Jesina? They\'ll be cute together if it happens 🤭 These four kept me laughing. They made the two main characters real and brought life to the book. B and Mira 🫡🤡Dain and Cat-Bro now idk what to think about them 😭😩 It feels weird. No they\'re not a couple or anything, just two idiotic characters....""I would have done the same thing you did because I\'m just as reckless for you as you are for me.""The romance. The spice. The action. The plot twists. The drama. The reveals. The writing. PERFECT🤭🤭 I believe the torture scenes and the training bits were the best written parts as it showed how deep all of their bond was. Butthat one scene(can\'t spoil) had me bawling my eyes out, so heart touching and I just wanted to hold and hug him 😭😭😭❤ Those who have read it will know 😭The reveals at theendtho OH MY GOSHHHH. Yes it\'s true I got spoiled for the ending but I didn\'t let it get to me. I was bummed but I ate it up because of how well Rebecca Yarros wrote it. The action was so good!! I couldn\'t put the book down at all. The cliffhanger tho 😭😭😭😭DAMN BRUTAL. DAMN. BRUTAL.Am gonna be obsessed with the next one too 😩😩 Can\'t wait for it.Be kind on the review. Or just move on, I won\'t tolerate any harassment on my reviews against my friends or me.~•~•~LET\'S GOOOOO'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I thought the first half of this book was close to unbearable and the second half was riveting.Why an editor didn\'t suggest shaving off a hundred or so pages of this book I do not know. It would be quite easy. Just get rid of the constant repetitive repetitious:“How am I supposed to really love you if I don’t know you?”and“He doesn’t trust me.” I shrug. “And I can’t really trust him. It’s complicated.”Because, god, it\'sreally notthat complicated. The romantic will they/won\'t they mostly played out inFourth Wing(of course they will) so having to sit through loads of faux love angst about ""oh, Xaden, how can I know you? How can I trust you? Fuck, you have a hot ass"" was so boring. Not to mention the fact that Yarros\' smutty talk is kinda cringe.I was so so close to skimming during the first half BUT I have to say I thought the book went on to redeem itself a lot in the second half.The politics and magic of this world are surprisingly quite interesting when they manage to rear their head in between Violet and Xaden\'s theatrics. Yarros developed side characters further and I really came to love the camaraderie between Violet, Rhi, Sawyer and Ridoc, as well as the developing relationships and tensions with new characters. I love the voices of the dragons. I enjoyed Varrish as a villain (one of the few things I did enjoy about the first half.)When we reached the battles at the climax of the novel, I couldn\'t look away. The action scenes were suspenseful and dramatic and the ending, though a bit predictable, made me actually interested in reading the next book.I admit I was shocked to discover three more books are planned.

I\'m going to need a moment to process all this.Many moments later...Right, onto my thoughts.Allow me a second to gush here. I love it when a book knows what it\'s there to do, and that is to entertain the reader. It isn\'t there to be slow or boring or god forbid, pretentious (shudders). Rather, its goal is to squeeze every ounce of joy and delight out of the pages, and that\'s what this series does best.Cracking open the first page, I was sucked right back into the world of Navarre and Violet Sorrengail. It\'s as if I\'ve never left it. Everything I loved from the first book is here—nonstop action, characters I could root for, snarky dragons, and sizzling romance. I couldn\'t turn the pages fast enough.The only thing I didn\'t love was our main couple having squabbles for half the book over reasons I couldn\'t make heads or tails of. I get that Rebecca Yarros has to inject some sort of strife between them to keep things interesting, but I was just confused. But if it\'s that or hundreds of pages of lovey-dovey mush, I guess I\'ll take confounding couple problems any day.I always have a sliver of trepidation going into book 2 of a series. What if my enjoyment of the first book was a fluke, a figment of my imagination? Or that the author somehow found the magical formula once, but can\'t reproduce it again? Or worse, that there\'s no interesting story left to tell? But I needn\'t worry becauseIron Flamecontains all the magic of its predecessor.I will say though, going in, the length at more than 600 pages was a bit daunting. But once I started, it didn\'t even matter. I was riveted throughout. It felt like every single page served a purpose—except for the aforementioned confounding couple problems—building momentum and eventually hurtling towards a stunning conclusion. Honestly, if there were another 600 pages, I\'d happily gobble those up too.Before this book, I admit I was a bit puzzled that there could be five books in this series, like how much more is there to this story? But seeing the way Yarros has built out the universe and the war in this book, and especially that ending, I get now how there could be so much more to this. And I\'m glad. I\'m not sure I\'m ready to say goodbye to Navarre any time soon, so I\'m happy there are still a few more books to come. I just hope the wait isn\'t too long.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.Fourth Wing~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""1 StarAlright, I'm not going to rant or be very specific in this review because I know many people are still currently reading the book.

I was tempted several times to dnf and simply pretend it doesn’t exist.the main characters in this were absolutely infuriating. they both became the worst possible versions of themselves and it made their relationship completely insufferable. they went from being one of my favorite book couples, to me not caring whether they even lived to see the end of the book.the entire story was so rushed through that I was getting whiplash. the plot of this one book could’ve been spread across the next three books. she needs to slow down the story, because rushing through the plot devalues everything.throwing in plot twists every other chapter for shock value does not make a book better, especially considering most of these plot twists were clearly not planned out. it just feels exhausting.rebecca yarros needs to seriously reevaluate her long-term plan if she wants to restore the integrity of this series (if possible at this rate). the remaining 3 books need to be properly researched, thoroughly thought out, and most importantly: NOT rushed for the sake of popularity.and it probably wouldn’t hurt to fire whoever her editor is (if said editor exists)two stars for a three star read. yes, i’m knocking an additional star off for this being my most highly anticipated read for the back half of the year, and then it having the absolute audacity to be one of the worst books i’ve ever read.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️Overall,Iron Flamewas okay.Parts I\'ve enjoyed and parts I found myself skimming through the pages. It was littered with fillers.My favorite parts were mostly the action scenes and the dragon scenes.I wasn\'t a big fan of the development of the romance in this one, there were tender and hot moments but that still didn\'t make up for how the relationship seemed to go in circles rather than grow. Maybe that\'s because Xaden\'s development was.....meh? Not that Violet\'s development was any better.I absolutely loved the tension between Violet and Xaden in Fourth Wing, but once the relationship passes that phase it\'s tricky for authors to keep it interesting and it certainly fell short in this sequel.I don\'t know if I\'m the only one who feels this way but this book was heavy in dialogue and information dump and that\'s why it felt like it was dragging..The drama between some of the characters had me roll my eyes because most of it was so unnecessary we could be doing other far more interesting things than this.I\'ll just highlight a few spoilers below to get some points across so beware..............[Iron Flame Spoilers Ahead].............First of all, the jealous ex trope should be on every author\'s list of banned tropes. It always results in unnecessary drama and tension between the couple that I do not need especially when they have far more important issues they need to resolve between them. Imighttolerate it if they weren\'t an established couple, but if they are then that\'s a big no no for me.I wanted to throw my kindle at the wall. It\'s just frustrating to read about.And speaking of Violet and Xaden\'s relationship, dancing around the whole ""trust"" issue while still hiding things from each other simply because the other didn\'t bother to ""ask"" was annoying and did not add anything to their relationship but to create unnecessary tension. Did Xaden actuallyworkfor earning back Violet\'s trust or was he just waiting around for whenever the time was convenient? And Violet\'s judgement and choices were often clouded by her longing and lust for Xaden.Still I found some of their scenes tender and sexy but it definitely is less appealing to me than it was in Fourth Wing. Their relationship has less substance now.Because of how lukewarm my emotions were throughout most of the book, the ending did not gut me as much.These thoughts reflect my own experience while reading this book.'}]"

Her days of living in anonymity among the Humans are over: she has been called upon to uphold a historic peacekeeping alliance between the Vampyres and their mortal enemies, the Weres, and she sees little choice but to surrender herself in the exchange—again...Weres are ruthless and unpredictable, and their Alpha, Lowe Moreland, is no exception. He rules his pack with absolute authority, but not without justice. And, unlike the Vampyre Council, not without feeling. It’s clear from the way he tracks Misery’s every movement that he doesn’t trust her. If only he knew how right he was….Because Misery has her own reasons to agree to this marriage of convenience, reasons that have nothing to do with politics or alliances, and everything to do with the only thing she's ever cared about. And she is willing to do whatever it takes to get back what’s hers, even if it means a life alone in Were territory…alone with the wolf.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""update: 4/27/24people are so funny. they preach about respecting people’s opinions and that everyone is entitled to it but contradict themselves and get hurt the moment they see someone rating a book 1-star and writing “a whole essay” on why they didn't like it. you poor thing, hurt over a stranger’s opinion over a book. on a book reviewing site. where we can all share our own thoughts. what has 2024 come to, right? i’ve decided to turn off comments and not let non-friends comment on reviews, as well as go private, cause people can’t understand that this is a public book reviewing site where we are all entitled to say what we want about a book we didn’t like. i’d like to remind everyone that this is my third ali hazelwood book and i read it because it was a paranormal romance, not a contemporary stem romance like the rest. y’all like to read but clearly didn’t read where i stated this.also, if you guys think this review is a whole essay, don't look at my full, coherent reviews. ALSO, if i wanna write an essay, you bet i will. i didn’t know there were rules to how we choose to write reviews! 🫣telling me to grow up but y’all are mad i didn't like your 2010 wattpad vampyre romance over a character named misery. y’all are miserable just like her name. commenting on reviews because you’re mad. 😂 you guys care way too much how strangers spend their own time, it's concerning.in reply to most comments i get:“get a job” i do, and it pays well. it pays more than enough for myself, for my bills, and for my food.“get a life” says the one commenting on a review they disagree with.“why spend your time reading her books” because i can. thanks for caring about how i chose to spend my own time.“did you need to write a whole essay?” did they never teach you in class how to write essays? these are bullet points. there’s a difference. but if i wanna write an ‘essay’ over a book i didn’t like, i will. maybe teach yourself what the words opinion and decision means.“it’s not that serious” so why are you mad?“you’re boring” good thing we aren’t friends.----------------------------------------if ali hazelwood has 1000 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 100 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 50 haters, i’m one of them. if ali hazelwood has 1 hater, i’m me. if ali hazelwood has no haters, it means i am dead. if the world is with ali hazelwood, then i am against the world.other actual thought because i did actually read this…this:• enemies to lovers WHERE? it is never to be seen. not even an ounce of it.• do authors not get second hand embarrassment giving their characters terrible names like misery and lowe??• vampYres instead of vampires is the cherry on top• that cover is giving 2013 wattpad era• i felt no chemistry between the characters. it’s too bad because their friendship and slow burn had potential.• of course he growls, hisses and has a very husky voice• don’t forget he’s So Big. his shoe size is 14, because that is very important and necessary information. his hand is also so big it engulfs her own. he towers over her because He’s Huge. DO NOT FORGET!• obviously he never actually Hated Her, he just had to kinda pretend. she just thinks he does because he can’t stand the smell of her. kinda like when edward was near bella that first time and she thought she reeked? yeah, like that. so she carried this misconception about what he thinks about her but OBVIOUSLY he just, has always liked her. he has been secretly obsessed with her, because when are theynot secretly obsessed but pretend they are not?never.• OF COURSE he’s broody and grumpy and can be mean in the outside but is actually a Big Softie deep down inside. DUH!• misery is quite possibly the most oblivious, useless, boring, weakest, most lame vampire i have ever read about. her being a vampire is actually really irrelevant that you might even forget she’s a vampire. she doesn’t know the difference between a ladle and spatula. ali really likes making her heroines really fucking stupid.• don’t ask me what she looks like because i wouldn’t know. all i know is that she bleeds purple and has pointy ears, which is a weird feature for vampires but whatever. it seems like this author still doesn’t like describing to her readers her characters enough to make them visualizing.• absolutely bland, boring, and very unflavored mmc, just like the rest. he’s a werewolf, has hair that is short and a rich brown cut to a buzz, is the alpha, has broad shoulders…that’s it. anything new? no, obviously. he growls and hisses, but this time he is an artist, i guess, who draws the mc, and takes care of a child.• this was only my third read from this author. i’ve readThe Love HypothesisandLove on the Brain, but i’ve avoided everything published after ‘love on the brain’ because i know i wouldn’t enjoy them. fortunately, i don’t have any desire to read them. i read this because it’s the first paranormal romance by this author, and, for some reason, i thought the genre would mean this would be different. that was not the case for me, obviously. i don’t think i’ll be reading this author again in the futureunless serena and koen get their story cause that ending?? 👀• terrible job of world-building. this author needs to stick to contemporaries. not only does this author not give enough physical descriptions about her characters features but the world building is severely lacking. there is little to no explanation of where and how everything happened. we really just get the basic information necessary. a lot of info dump in the beginning—historical context, names, wars, systems, political diplomatic views, etc. everything piled together.• formulaic, boring, cliché, and immature writing. i can’t even say it’s because this author started off writing fanfiction on ao3 when so many fanfics on ao3 (and even wattpad) are written immensely better than this. so many books published yet this this authors writing hasn’t improved since her debut. i guess when you write a book like the love hypothesis, your quality of books isn’t important anymore because you know your targeted audience will eat up the bare minimum. the characters in this might as well be the same as her previous characters except they’re in a paranormal setting.•if you are excited for this, take my review with a grain of salt as i haven’t enjoyed this author before so just because i didn’t like it, doesn’t mean you won’t.a lot of my friends love this author and her stories. if you haven’t read ali before, you might like it! or, if read her before and have an idea what to expect and don’t care about the formulaic writing, you might enjoy this! for me, the unoriginality, lack of world building, lack of physical characteristics, writing, dialogue, etc., are what made this another disappointing read. if you enjoy this though, good for you!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75/5I didn\'t expect this book to receive such a high rating from me, but as it turns out, I liked it — I liked it a lot even. I read Ali Hazelwood for the vibes and obsessed heroes, and that\'s exactly what I got, so I\'m satisfied. Satisfied to the point that this book may have become my favorite Ali book. I never thought a book with an arranged marriage between an alpha werewolf and a vampire would become one, but here we are. I guess that\'s what happens when you grow up with Wattpad.Listen. Is Ali the best author with the most gorgeous writing style? No. Does she write almost the same male characters, but with different hairstyles and workplaces? Yes. But does it matter to me? No. Her stories always absorb me from the very beginning to the end to the point where I completely forget about reality, so I simply love them despite their many imperfections. You could look me straight in the eye and tell me that these books are cringe, stupid, predictable and that I can probably find better stories on Wattpad, and I would completely agree, but I would still simply read them, as they just have that something that works for me.But, let’s move on to the point. My thoughts. Some spoilers also start here.oneIf you were expecting another short heroine and a hero who would be twice her size, you will be disappointed. We finally have a tall couple.\u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200e \u200etwoI really liked our heroine Misery. Yes, Ali did her dirty with that name and some of her fashion choices — the galaxy t-shirt, but it doesn\'t change the fact that I enjoyed her character. She definitely won\'t be added to my \'favorite heroines\' folder, but compared to really dumb heroines, she wasn\'t bad.threeThe hero, despite the situation at the end when I wanted to strangle him, yes, I\'m talking about the scene in chapter twenty-five when he left her, claiming that ""it was a mistake"" and ""she shouldn\'t be tied to someone like him"", still stole my heart. I know he wanted her to finally have free will and be able to choose what she wanted in her life, but he could have approached it differently.Still, as I said, I loved him. How could I not love the possessive architect Alpha Werewolf who has an amazing way with children, who would do anything for you and his people, who would draw you, who would remind you that consent is the hottest thing in the world and with whose side you would finally find your family and your place in the world. Yes, I know the part about ""architect Alpha Werewolf"" sounds stupid and like something straight out of a bad Wattpad fanfiction, but I don\'t care.“I would take anything she chose to give me—the tiniest fraction or her entire world. I would take her for a single night knowing that I’ll lose her by morning, and I would hold on to her and never let go. I would take her healthy, or sick, or tired, or angry, or strong, and it would be my fucking privilege. I would take her problems, her gifts, her moods, her passions, her jokes, her body—I would take every last thing, if she chose to give it to me.”fourThe romance was in typical Ali Hazelwood style, meaning a hero who is almost in love with the heroine from the beginning, but for some reason doesn\'t want to admit it, and a heroine who can\'t pick up any hint about it even though it\'s quite obvious. However, this does not change the fact that I ate it up. The smut too, if you know me, you don\'t, but it was kind of hot.fiveThe plot was pretty interesting to me in the beginning, but it lost me towards the end when I stopped caring about the whole werewolf/vampire rivalry and Misery’s friend situation, but I was still intrigued enough to not put the book down once, so I won\'t complain.This was supposed to be a short review, but it didn\'t work out again, but if you are looking for a marriage in convenience romance, found family, werewolves and vamps, a slow-burn with, at least, in my opinion, great tension, don’t be shy and add it to your tbr.————————Vampires and werewolfs?

I applaud Ali Hazelwood for taking a risk out of her comfort zone and writing this paranormal romance. She did not ruin werewolves and vampires for me after all 😌This change of writing and direction was majorly needed and it worked brilliantly. But tbf I had minimal expectations 🤷\u200d♀️✔️ Vampires + werewolves✔️ Marriage of convenience✔️ Slow burnThis one came pretty close to perfection. I liked the plot, characters and romance.The paranormal romance and gothic vibes were really good, the whole environment was quite mesmerizing.Tho I would suggest that please don't go in expecting a world building- it's just romance. It's also quite fast paced and easy to binge. If you are in a reading slump, this is your cure.The characters are fun.Misery and Loweare truly made for each other. I love how they balance each other out. While Misery is unlike misery, in fact quite joyful and a fun vamp to be around. Lowe, on the other hand keeps to himself. I also noticed that Lowe although a werewolf, had a very Edward Cullen like personality. Instead of a typical douche, you are met with someone who actually cares. Misery's sarcasm and sense of humor was fun. Ali Hazelwood thankfully for once did not go over the top with it.The side characters-Ana, Serena and Alex were stand outs. Owen was kinda predictable. It also seems like there's something happening with Serena and Koen? Is there going to be another book? CAUSE I NEED IT!!!The romancewas pretty good. I devoured how Lowe and Misery were into each other. The slow burn was delicious. The spice not so much. Ali, listen to me bestie, in the most gentle way possible, babes, you cannot write smut 😭😭 I know you want to. But please for the love of God, stop writing smut. I wanna give you five stars but I can't until you stop knotting, and opening an Airbnb inside people's vaginas 😭😭On a serious note,one thing that could have been better written was the mate storyline.It did not make sense. One moment Lowe wants her, the next he doesn't, then he does, then he doesn't, and then he does. Yeah, he clearly wanted her so why write it like that?! That deducted a star from me.Overall, it's pretty fun and worth trying.

I'm an Ali Hazelwood stan, so my hopes for her very first PNR were extremely high, and I’m so happy that it lived up to all my expectations. This is a marriage of convenience between a vampire heroine and an alpha werewolf hero. Misery is the daughter of a powerful vampire politician and she enters a MOC with Lowe, the alpha of a werewolf pack, not just to form an alliance between the two species (who don’t like each other), but also to find out where her missing best friend is.It’s such a fun read and I loved learning about this paranormal world.

Ali Hazelwood showed readers how to rock \'n\' roll in a fantasy universe by creating the most intelligent, quirky, nerdy heroine free of stereotypes and clichés. She possesses magical fingers that can sharpen computer skills for coding and breaking into highly secured werewolf territories!Themes of enemies to lovers and forbidden love may initially make us think we\'re in for a Twilight-like romance story. However, I assure you that this complex story offers so much more. Firstly, this book is more than a forbidden romance; it tells the tale of Misery Lark, the only daughter of the most powerful Vampyr councilman in the South, and Lowe Moreland, the most powerful Alpha of the Werewolves. Their marriage aims to bring peace and create an alliance between age-old mortal enemies. There\'s so much happening in the story, including political maneuvering and highly calculated schemes within the territories of werewolves and vampyres. A group of rebels, calling themselves the ""Loyals,"" whose lives have been spared by Lowe, seeks to avenge him by recruiting insiders from their inner circles, blackmailing them into committing treasonous acts.The story is filled with action-packed sequences, intricate world-building, and intercepted mysteries about Lowe\'s family line and Misery\'s inner circle, all of which intrigue readers to learn more. Interestingly, the adventure parts of the book slightly overshadow the romantic aspects. The fantasy world-building and the detailed rules and historical progress among werewolves, vampyres, and humans are depicted intelligently. I expected Ali Hazelwood to excel in the fantasy genre as much as in steamy romance, and I\'m thrilled to say she didn\'t disappoint.Here\'s a summary of the events in this book:After evading several attempts on her life, including bullets, knives, and other lethal weapons orchestrated to kill her, Misery leaves the Vampyre community to live in the human world with her best friend, Serena. She gets a job, wears contact lenses to conceal her irises, hides her fangs, and strives to create a peaceful life. However, her father summons her, proposing a marriage between werewolves and vampyres to establish an alliance during the reign of a new human governor. Misery is too smart not to take the bait, but as soon as she hears the name of the groom-to-be, she accepts the offer without asking for details. Is it a martyr complex, a personal concession, or does she have another agenda for her extremely masculine groom who cannot stand her scent?After the marriage ceremony proceeds without incident, if you discount the usual suicide attempts against Misery (she\'s become accustomed to these life-threatening situations since she was once a forced prisoner for a peace offering, but that\'s another story), Misery finds herself in her secluded mansion, surrounded by werewolves who despise her, searching for a reason to end the forced arrangement. Only six-year-old Anna, Lowe\'s little sister, acts friendly toward her despite her caregivers\' snarky comments about Misery.When Lowe senses the secret that threatens her unwanted marriage, he offers her an alliance to uncover the mysteries that will ultimately benefit them. However, not only their lives but also their hearts are at stake during this very perilous, full-throttle, wild adventure.Lowe is more than a vindictive alpha werewolf facade. He\'s loyal, perceptive, caring, and puts everyone\'s needs first. He\'s the first person to show how much he truly cares about her. Could she learn to trust and lower her emotional barricades to let him in?Overall, this is a smart, riveting, and highly entertaining quirky fantasy romance that I thoroughly enjoyed. I hope there will be more to come, as implied in the epilogue. I wholeheartedly congratulate my favorite steamy romance author for immersing me in a well-executed fantasy world, even though I\'m not a big fan of werewolves (I was never on Team Jacob).Many thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing book\'s digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest thoughts.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""what started off as promising went downhillquick.╰┈➤ first 1/3 of the book: solid 4 stars 😄╰┈➤ if i had skipped the spice: 3 stars 🙂╰┈➤the book including theknotspice: 2 stars 🥴╰┈➤ the spice alone: 0 stars. negative stars, even. jail.the spice wasknotit.it wasn't even the knot itself that was bad... it washowthe scenes were written. i amslightly?traumatized. i also traumatized my husband when i forced him to read some of the spice. at least i’m not alone in my misery.speaking of Misery...… really? that is, no joke, the name of the fmc. need i say more?i hope i never have to think ofThe Home Depot’sLowe’s strange, lumpy penis ever again.i am moving on now, goodbye. 👋🏻😌""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""This isknotnot your typical Ali Hazelwood butif you are looking for a furr-ociously good time…no, no, that's too corny…mount up and…wait, too suggestive…sink your teeth into…ah hell…Okay soBrideby Ali Hazelwood is going to lend itself to a lot of jokes and I applaud Hazelwood for leaning into them because at its heart this is a fun and rather bitingly funny novel that brings us back into the veins of paranormal romance that dominated the early 2000s. A forced wedding between a vampire and werewolf (a big, beefy, beast of a man-beast) in order to uphold an uneasy truce kick off this story of paranormal politicking and high-energy action paired with a slow-burn romance of an enemies-to-lovers plot (okay it’s not really EtL, it’s more like vaguely-distrustful to lovers) that puts a new meaning to the term “heavy petting” (pawing?). I tend to prefer romance stories that have a larger plot to hold them up, which is what we have here, though admittedly the plot is a bit lackluster and kind of conflates complicating the reveal of the politics and mysteries with actual complexity. Still this is a pretty fun read that highlights a lot of what Hazelwood does best in a very different scenario for her while also making it feel like a natural next step for her stories and I think this is one that if decide to bite in for some fun, you’ll get just that.Oh, have I mentioned the werewolf is huge yet? Big shocker in a Hazelwood book, right? I mean, when I saw werewolf man we all knew this was coming (and so is he…) but guess what? Misery (oh yea, she named her Misery lol) is tall, so I’d like to applaud Hazelwood for some character growth. Oh, wait, sorry, Werewolf Lowe is actually so huge he can’t even fit in their single king-sized bed (if you are playing Romance Tropes drinking game, take a shot for single bed) so you be the judge if its still her big man little woman trope (if yes, take another shot). But it is sort of fun to see a lot of Hazelwood’s signature elements here and I suppose this is the paranormal offshoot of her STEM stories as Misery happens to be a computer genius and that comes in handy (paw-y?) here.There’s a lot going on here and without spoiling much, due to some long feud and a lot of weird truces that tend to involve hostages and interspecieseroticapairings, humans, werewolves and vampires are all poised and ready for bloodshed and this marriage is another stop-gap in that all. Misery now has to live amongst werewolves (they go by Weres which…okay I’ll get to the world building soon but its not the best) who definitely want to kill her but shes so used to ‘feeling alone among people who were never supposed to be my own’ after living with humans all life that she’s gonna give it the old college try! Good for her even if ‘the whole rival-species-bound-by-centuries-of-hostility-until-the-bloody-demise-of-the-weakest-will-put-an-end-to-the-senseless-suffering thing might seem discouraging.’ Theres a slow moving romance as they move from utter distrust to relying on each other and Lowe being pretty damn into her while refusing to admit it and Misery refusing to notice that he’s pretty damn obvious because we need to stretch this already thin plot out with some romantic tension (drink). This is actually fairly light on the romance and the spicier stuff comes later and while this book does lean towards some omegaverse vibes it feels more a nod to all that than actually embracing it. Except knotting (take a shot). Hazelwood fans will enjoy this and they should, though I’m curious if those who might come to this from a deep love or paranormal romance might find it to read like a pop song cover of a deep-cut song they enjoy.This felt fairly undercooked though to me. In part because the world building is mostly done through conversation between Misery and Lowe, which is something I love in theory and found books likeThe Long Way to a Small, Angry Planetto brilliantly execute world building through picking up context in casual conversations between characters, but here the two are distrustful and all coy about revealing things. Its like pulling teeth because thats basically what they are doing to get answers out of each other and I found myself shaking the book screamingjust fucking tell me already(take another shot, not for tropes but in solidarity). Actually, Lowe is kind of annoying at times to be honest, even with his whole “tough alpha” schtick masking that he’s really a sweet sensitive boy packing a donkey sized dick (drink), and his whole “want better than me” thing was eye rolling. But anyways, the bigger catch is…none of the elements feel particularly fresh? And nobody wants a stale body if you are going to suck it’s blood, am i right vampires? A lot of it felt rather cut-and-paste or “spot what this is inspired by” which sometimes made me realize I liked the techniques better in the other books. Theres definitely a BIGUnderworldfilm vibe here, and the whole sucking blood being orgasmic has been done before. I didn’t dislike this book but it made me actually realize I might like Butler’sFledglingmore than I did before. It all works though, I just don’t think fantasy world building is Hazelwood’s greatest strength and a lot of the ambiguities work to ignore that a lot of it feels fairly flimsy.So will these two ‘live bitingly ever after’ or will the politics of their world crush them? It’s worth a read, and I did like the characters quite a bit. I do like Misery asserting herself against and “alpha” and him recognizing her as a strong woman with agency. The plot is pretty fun too with some good twists, and really I have nothing to complain about other than it just didn’t land as well for me as her YA book. It does seem to be both chasing a romantasy trend while also broadening and popularizing it so its sort of a publishing slam dunk and I think a lot of people will rightfully enjoy it.

""El Animal Salvaje"" se despliega ante nosotros como una intrincada tela de araña, tejida con hilos de apariencias engañosas, envidias de clase, complejas estafas y atracos audaces. Esta novela es un thriller que te atrapa desde la primera página, creando un vértigo literario que hace imposible soltar el libro. Confieso que devoré sus páginas con avidez, consumiendo cien tras cien en cada sentada, hasta terminarla en menos de 48 horas.Sin embargo, lo que distingue a ""El Animal Salvaje"" de sus predecesores no es solo su trama absorbente. En este libro, Dicker nos sorprende con dos cambios notables respecto a su estilo característico. Primero, el elenco de personajes es sorprendentemente reducido, lo que nos permite profundizar en ellos. Segundo, aunque Dicker mantiene su firma narrativa de jugar con múltiples líneas temporales, en esta ocasión, los saltos son notablemente más intuitivos y fáciles de seguir. Este ajuste es un alivio bienvenido y un cambio en su técnica que, para mi modo de ver, enriquece la experiencia de lectura.Totalmente recomendable, Dicker mantiene su esencia en esta novela. La historia ofrece diversión y suspense en medidas iguales. Si te gusta Dicker, esta novela no solo cumple con las expectativas, sino que las supera.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Personaggi di carta velina , ( in particolar modo le donne che nei romanzi di Dicker possono ricadere in due sole categorie , le deluse e insoddisfatte dalla vita e le femme fatale desiderate da tutti, """"""difficili da domare""""""), dialoghi insulsi che hanno scatenato più di un eye rolling, introspezione psicologica pressoché nulla, eventi che si succedono troppo velocemente e senza nessun perché, espedienti da soap opera... decisamente il meno riuscito dei suoi romanzi assieme a ""Il libro dei Baltimore"". Dicker non mi ha mai colpito per la prosa (sempre piatta e banale) ma questo libro non solo sembra una bozza ma manca anche di ciò che almeno si trovava negli altri romanzi e che compensava la debolezza dello stile di scrittura : i colpi di scena, la suspance e il ritmo serrato delle indagini che rendevano i suoi romanzi dei pageturner.

No estamos ante una novela de negra con una investigación, sino que la trama gira en torno a un atraco, pero el tema principal de la historia es poner de manifiesto, por un lado, el peligro de vivir de las apariencias, y por otro, el de quien se cree solo conociendo una parte del todo, que la vida de los demás es mejor que la propia. Una novela sobre la insatisfacción, la rutina (con su lado bueno y su versión más oscura) y las parejas de larga duración.Aun así, el estilo característico de Dicker sigue más que presente: capítulos cortos, muchos personajes todos con algo que esconder y algún giro más o menos inesperado. Para mi, ha sido quizá su obra menos sorprendente en relación a plot twist, pero no me voy a quejar porque en otras ocasiones he sentido que abusaba del elemento sorpresa para dejarte con la boca abierta a base de “trampas” o que renunciaba a verosimilitud para conseguirlo. ¿Puedes intuir más o menos lo que va a ocurrir? Si. ¿Eso me fastidió la lectura? No.Un par de apuntes sobre la trama… Todo sucede en Ginebra y los protagonistas serán dos matrimonios afincados en un barrio lujoso, aunque uno “vive mejor” que otro. La amistad entre ellos devendrá en una obsesión y… pasan cosas.Entonces, ¿está aquí “el mejor” Dicker? Pues cuestión de gustos. Para mí no, porque disfruto más las novelas donde construye personajes que son lo que acabo recordando más allá del misterio. Pero esta novela sin dudas da lo que promete, es un libro que no puedes soltar y muy entretenido. Entonces, si buscas acción y que pasen muchas cosas todo el rato, es tu libro. Me lo he comido con patatas en dos días y me parece un libro disfrutón, muy conseguido y donde cierra sin dejar ningún hilo suelto.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Terrificante.Ti ricorderò com’eri, Joel, ai tempi in cui eri ancora scrittore di romanzi e non sceneggiatore di soap opere. 2 stelle, ma in nome dell’affetto e della memoria passata.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3*El 2 de julio de 2022, dos delincuentes se disponen a robar en una importante joyería de Ginebra.

Serán necesarios varios viajes al pasado, lejos de Ginebra, para hallar el origen de esta intriga diabólica de la que nadie saldrá indemne.Entretenimiento puro y sin otro interés, cómo ver una película un sábado noche en la que los giros se suceden sin parar y terminas satisfecho, pero que a las pocas horas ya has olvidado incluso el título de la película.Eso es lo que pienso de la nueva novela del autor superventasJoël Dicker, del que tampoco soy demasiado fan, tan sólo había leído la indispensable y muy disfrutaba""La verdad sobre el caso Harry Quebert”y""Los últimos días de nuestros padres”, una novela con un cambio de registro hacia una trama bélica en la que se mezclaban espionaje, amor, amistad y una reflexión profunda acerca del ser humano y sus debilidades, quizá la mejor novela que he leído de Dicker hasta la fecha.Con su nueva novela titulada“Un animal salvaje”, el autor suizo nos traslada a Ginebra y Saint Tropez, con acercamientos a San Marino, Londres o Zaragoza, a través de una trama que gira en torno a un atraco y a 2 parejas (y un ""añadido"") con muchos secretos.Narración en tercera persona, con prosa muy ágil y continuos saltos temporales (antes y después del atraco, desde 2007 a 2022) que hacen que la lectura sea muy rápida y que el interés no decaiga en ningún momento, de ahí que el libro se lea de una sentada (6 o 7 horas y te lo ventilas).No hay mucho más que decir en cuanto a la profundidad de los personajes ni de la trama, pues todo se ve reducido a esos continuos giros que se producen en los papeles que juega cada uno de los personajes, sobre todo de las 2 parejas protagonistas y del “tercero” en discordia, todos ellos personajes muy misteriosos y llenos de secretos, que poco a poco se van desvelando y nos van dejando alguna que otra sorpresa. El final es más o menos esperado, aunque es cierto que por el camino las sorpresas se van sucediendo, todo hace esperar ese cierre de la trama. Las descripciones de las localizaciones y de cómo se realiza el atraco y la investigación no tienen ninguna fisura y se ve que Dicker ha hilado una trama intrincada de una manera muy sutil y sin nada que reprochar, la verdad es que hay que reconocerle el gran trabajo a la hora de planificar un libro con tantos saltos temporales y en el que nada queda al azar ni ""suena raro"".Novela para pasar el rato, sin pedir nada más ni pretender encontrar un novelón, lo cierto es que el gran poder de la novela recae en la habilidad de Dicker como “contador de historias”, y aunque en esta novela cambie un poco de registro -y se pase demasiado con el salseo amoroso, demasiado para mi gusto- el resultado es aceptable y muy disfrutable, aún así 3 estrellas muy justitas son más que suficientes.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Nici de această dată Joël Dicker nu dezamăgește!

Escrito en capítulo muy cortos, divididos a su vez en subcapítulos, intercalando los sucesos actuales con flashbacks de hechos anteriores que nos van dando contexto, su lectura se hace muy ágil y entretenida, consiguiendo que las páginas (y la historia) avancen sin darnos cuenta.Dice la sinopsis: “El 2 de julio de 2022, dos delincuentes se disponen a robar en una importante joyería de Ginebra. Un incidente que dista mucho de ser un vulgar atraco. Veinte días antes, en una lujosa urbanización a orillas del lago Lemán, Sophie Braun se prepara para celebrar su cuadragesimo cumpleaños.

Serán necesarios varios viajes al pasado, lejos de Ginebra, para hallar el origen de esta intriga diabólica de la que nadie saldrá indemne”.Dicker nos presenta una historia con pocos personajes, donde todos están perfectamente definidos y podemos identificarlos sin problema. En la trama nos encontramos un par de giros de guion que debo reconocer que me esperaba pero que cuadran perfectamente. El final, adecuado, no digo nada para no hacer spoiler pero se siente que todo queda en su sitio. En resumen, una lectura perfecta para entretenerse, sin más pretensiones, ideal para estos momentos de verano.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'A veces disfrutar de la lectura pasa por algo tan sencillo como encontrar un buen contador de historias que, además, cuente buenas historias. Parece básico pero no debe ser fácil, la mayoría de los libros que se publican están lejos de atrapar al lector al nivel de Dicker. Y más difícil aún debe ser sostenerlo en el tiempo, aunque existan borrones (por ejemplo, a mi la Desaparición de Stephanie Mailer me parece un desbarre).""Es un escritor de fórmula"" me han comentado más de una vez, lo mismo sí, mi conocimiento no me da para adoctrinar sobre esa cuestión. Pero si es así, que vengan más y escriban libros siguiendo el mismo patrón, quiero más lecturas de verano como esta. Tampoco debe ser sencillo, a veces las matemáticas están lejos de ser exactas.Esta vez Dicker nos sitúa en Europa, principalmente en Suiza, para contarnos la historia de un robo a la vieja usanza, creando tensión desde el primer minuto, sin que necesariamente esta esté centrada en el plan, ya que las relaciones entre los personajes se llevan la palma para hacernos morder sus anzuelos. Y los mordemos, quizás no todos, pero varios si que van a la boca. Como en toda su obra, en esto sí es reconocible, abundan los giros, regiros y trampas, y va zarandeando la simpatía de la persona lectora que tiene que esperar más de la mitad del libro para identificar el personaje por el que desea decantarse.Que le voy a hacer, una vez más me lo he pasado muy bien leyendo a Dicker y descubriendo los personajes que va tejiendo y las experiencias que los explican.Por poner un pero, esta vez sí que he sido capaz de anticipara algunas de sus sorpresas. Debe ser que con el tiempo nos vamos conociendo. Da igual, la predictibilidad, no quita mérito ni valor al disfrute.Voy a por otro, que mañana empieza el instituto.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Me encantó!

En eso Dicker no defrauda!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Voy a empezar diciendo algo sumamente impopular. A Joel Dicker se le está empezando a poner cara de Javier Castillo. Ahora debajo del paraguas voy a intentar explicarme.Después de una irrupción llena de buenos augurios, casi todo lo que ha venido después ha sido sustentado por un primer libro bastante acertado y un fenómeno fandom desproporcionado (todo siempre desde mi opinión más subjetiva). Hay escritores que evolucionan y otros que se dedican a reescribir una y otra vez la misma historia con distinto envoltorio. La escritura puede tener alma o seguir unas pautas. Uno que es rarito prefiere la primera, y en este libro lo único que tenemos es una presentación, un nudo y un desenlace de lo más estándar. El jugar con el tiempo no es mal recurso, pero existen otros muchos que no estaría de más explorar.Los escritores no nos deben nada a los lectores y nos lo deben todo. Yo sé que no soy nadie para exigir y que cada uno cuenta sus historias como lo siente y como quiere. A mí me da ¿Pena?¿Rabia? que un talento como el de la escritura, al alcance de muy pocos se diluya en la comodidad de saber que su próximo libro se venderá solo con llevar su firma.Pero dejaré de divagar y voy a ir al libro. Se nos cuenta un atraco, pero más sobre las personas que se verán implicadas en ello. Gente perfecta con problemas de gente perfecta y gente mediocre con problemas más mundanos. Personajes con los que es difícil empatizar y más difícil aún cogerles cariño. Todo avanza hacia un desastre que parece imposible de evitar y que será resuelto sin profundizar en nada.No sé la intención del autor, si era presentarnos a personajes reales, o que en la vida no hay ni ganadores ni perdedores, solo gente actuando... Estas dudas, de si hay más de lo que he podido ver, hacen que no le dé solo dos estrellas a este libro que al menos se lee rápido y hace que quieras seguir avanzando.

El libro mezcla el presente con constantes flash backs para comprender los comportamientos de nuestro tres protagonistas. La brevedad de los capítulos te invitan a continuar la historia sin interrupciones, de forma que cuando quieres darte el cuento el libro lo has terminado.A mi el libro, con sus quiebros, requiebros, giros y sorpresas me ha gustado bastante, pero tengo que reconocer que no es el mejor (ni mucho menos) de Joel, por ello le he hurtado una estrella en la valoración.

𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐒𝐌𝐀𝐋𝐋 𝐌𝐎𝐌𝐄𝐍𝐓𝐒.They gave me all the feels. The soft touches. Him randomly tucking her hair behind her ear. Her just staring at him bc he’s so damn hot. The forehead kisses.

This man is the most caring, reckless and loving creature that managed to work his way into my soul. He’s so thoughtful and his inner monologue is so funny. But their banter is even better 🤌❤️\u200d🔥He actually had his own life in this book too. Sometimes dual povs just feel like one because they’re both living the same thing. But this book showed the distinction between their thought processes and how they’re actual individuals, not the same brain.Gosh, 𝗔𝗡𝗔𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗦𝗜𝗔 𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗘𝗡 was so relatable. It was so hard seeing her go through all that shit but watching her grow stronger and healthier was so rewarding. I’m so proud of how she dealt with things.I loved how she became amazing friends with the team and cared about them like family. I loved her for saying what she wanted and sticking to it too. I’m so glad she had a spine and stood up for herself when it mattered.I’m genuinely so impressed this is a debut novel and I cannot WAIT to read more from Hannah Grace!!Whew!

I haven’t read something so unentertaining in a long time and only wasted my time for ten long hours.The book was way too long and too much. Too much drama, too much plot, too much was happening. I was half way into it when I already forgot what happened before because it.was.just.to.much, of everything. I wanted to dnf this book 10% into it, because it was so boring, but I never dnf a book before so I wanted to keep going. But it was just awful. I couldn’t wait until I finally (FINALLY) got to the end. (Have to confess I also skipped a few parts, mainly Anastasias chapters, halfway through the book because these awful, boring scenes weren’t bearable anymore after a few hours into it.)Aaron was a walking red flag since his introduction. I didn’t like him for a second (he gave me major bipolar disorder vibes with his mood swings). His character was awful und I didn’t enjoy a second of him being in this book. I understand that he was the main villain, but he shouldn’t have so much scene time. The main part of this book was for me hating him and I couldn’t enjoy anything beside because the next second he was back again and my mood fell. I don’t understand how people could keep up with him for so long, he clearly was a bad person (even if dumb Anastasia says other wise).Sabrine I liked just fine, but it’s doesn’t sit right with me reading about her behaviors while she is representing a muslim girl (or I suspect she is muslim because most of Algerians are), but I don’t know if she is for sure.Beside her there were too many side characters, I can’t even remember everyone who was there and why they were there.It’s shocking but the one person I disliked more than Aaron was Anastasia herself. Her whole character was so so so unlikable for me. Her freak-outs, how bad she treated Nathan even though he was always nice to her. The on, off, cold, hot she gave him and how she only liked him when she was drunk was annoying and irritating. Sometimes she acted like the biggest child and I hate how no one stood up to her and beat her in place, because she was such a mean person sometimes to the people around her (mainly Nathan who she always attacks without even knowing if he done anything wrong). She deserved to end up losing everything she worked towards. These „getting under his skin“ actions were unnecessary and childish. It was not funny at all and I hate Nathan for playing along with her every time she fucked him over again.It’s paradox how she is portrayed as a dominant, strong willed character with everyone else, but she lets Aaron walk over her over and over again till the last 2 chapters.I really hated her for every second she was present in this book more than I hated Aaron.What was Ryan’s purpose? He was a major part for the first half of the book but in the end he wasn’t even mention. Like he didn’t exist and the author just forgot he was there once. But he also is a person I didn‘t like. He was nice and all but he was interested in Olivia, wants more while laying half naked in a bed with another woman ? Kuddling her ? I wouldn’t want to talk to a boy who is seeing other girls beside me, let alone doing sleepovers with his ex-fuck-buddy.The only part of this book I liked was Nathan’s character. He was cute and polite, respectful, a green flag boy the whole time (even when he was mad that is girlfriend was fucked over and blinded by another man, as he should). He was attentive and always courteous. He cared for others more than he cared for himself. He took care of Anastasia, of his team, his sister. He was totally a golden retriever with a heart of gold. I wish he hadn’t ended up with Anastasia. He clearly deserves something so much better than her. Someone who loves him as equal as he loves, and Anastasia’s wasn’t that. She was just awful to him, treats him poorly and didn’t deserve him or his kindness.This one star is for Nathan and Nathan only.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'To sum up my thoughts very quickly… there was too much going on and yet somehow there was also absolutely nothing going on - so out of a weird mix of annoyance and boredom, I DNFd it at 50%But in case your interested in details…I should have realized right away that I wasn’t gonna like this book when I had a really hard time digesting the writing. There was something about it that wasn’t flowing smoothly from the pages into my brain and therefore I was reading it really slowly and found myself putting it down a lot (which is a very bad sign)Then there was also so much info-dumping for all the side characters. It felt like she already pre-planned out a multi book companion series and was trying too hard to get us invested in all of the side characters by giving them each so much detail and page time.We’ve got her best friend (Liv) who’s starting to get with his best friend (Robbie). Her skating partner (Aaron) who’s mentally and emotionally abusive to her (but she doesn’t realize this even though she’s been in therapy for years and supposedly is really good at expressing her thoughts and figuring out how she’s feeling… but okay.) There’s also a bunch of guys from the hockey team that end up becoming a part of this large friend group that’s forming (JJ, Henry, Russ, Bobby + more). Did I forget to mention Robbie? Yea, he’s Anastasia’s fuck buddy at the beginning of the book because she doesn’t have any interest in committing to a relationship because she just wants to focus on her training and skating career…. but it’s okay because early on he ends up starting a relationship with someone that Liv (Anastasia’s best friend) absolutely hates… so now her and Robbie are just best friends who sleep in the same bed together without shirts on sometimes… nbd (🙄)Then there’s Nate. He’s a sweetie and I liked him enough - but not enough to keep reading. Especially because I really didn’t like Anastasia. As for their relationship… I didn’t like that either. It was a-lot of tell and no show - and the few times there was show and they actually had a minute alone with each other, they would just get it on (yawn).As for the actual plotline - there was none. Yup. None — Basically all these characters meet for the first time when they are forced to start sharing an ice rink and that’s basically just a setup for them all to become friends… and then the rest of the story (from what I’ve read) is just watching them do everyday college shit like go to parties and bars and study and go to training and boring things like that.The funny thing is, is that right at the halfway point is when we get the second half of what was mentioned in the synopsis… where Aaron (the abusive skating partner) causes a ton of drama by getting injured and blaming it on Nate - so Nate ends up getting benched for a while and decides to fill in as Anastasia’s new skating partner…. and that’s right around where I gave up on the story.… and I’m just sayin… don’t put something in the synopsis if it’s not gonna happen until midway through - IMO the synopsis should only have information that takes place in the first 50-100 pages… but what do I know?So to sum all that up again… there were too many characters, too much drama, and somehow there was nothing actually going on other than all these people hanging out a bunch and Anastasia getting it on with Nate every time she was drunk and horny.Is it crazy to say that I have so much more I could complain about?? Even after my longest review ever?? It’s fine, I’ll stop myself here… but just know… I had more.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Is this what kids are into nowadays? Am I too ancient, too old, too out of touch with reality to understand what gen Z likes?""stop slapping your balls this loud""""her ass smells so good""""can Lola really hear my balls?""Yes, these are all quotes from this book.Well... there was zero plot. Every single character talked like they were 15 and just found out about sex through giphs on tumblr. And honestly, sex is the only thing they talk about. Every single page. There is nothing but: who\'s hooking up with who, how many kinky things they\'ve done, waking up and training while wasted from the parties they went to the night before, and how loud his balls are against her thighs when they\'re having sex.The FMC has a hardcore/severe eating disorder. AND THERE IS LEGIT A SENTENCE WHERE THEY EXCUSE A GUY KNOCKING SOMEONE UP BY SAYING:oh, it wasn\'t his fault, he doesn\'t know a lot about pregnancy. he\'s a good guy, he\'s just a 25 year old MAN who doesn\'t understand how sex works. so you gotta give him a pass.But yeah, if you want to know what this one is about, it\'s just a wattpad book that hasn\'t been edited. But I guess these are the books that get publisher deals nowadays.There are too many characters that are introduced in a very confusing way. They get yelled at by their coaches every 10 pages and talk about sex and alcohol for the remaining pages. Rinse and repeat. They all end up sharing a rink and spend a lot more time together, yatta, yatta.It\'s not the worst book I have ever read. But... It is written like a Wattpad story. Repetitive, long and childish.

Stupid instalove shit with a self righteous poorly executed “girlboss” mc who’s whole personality is being sassy and shallow but really she’s fighting demons 🥺🥺🥺🥺 SHUT UP and the love interest is somehow even worse at the beginning of the book he’s said to be in love with a girl and wants to marry her but completely forgets she even exists upon meeting Anastasia? By the way “Stassie” is one of the ugliest nicknames I’ve ever heard in my life. Bitch isn’t the Loch Ness monster.SECOND OF ALL the way he’s immediately like “omg I would do anything to hear Stassie’s laugh again 😍” SHUT THE FUXKKKKK UP YOU JUST MET HER PLEASE LIKE it’s actually painful and So Fucking Forced too. They don’t have two molecules of chemistry to rub together. You can tell the author was literally forcing infatuation on Nathan.THIRD OF ALL the plotline is ass. The author is clearly going for an enemies-to-lovers but Anastasia shouldn’t have even been mad at Nathan in the first place because it was over a minuscule predicament that wasn’t even remotely his fault. “I was planning on being mad at you forever” OVER FUCKING WHAT???? Id get it if she didn’t like him because he’s a useless pushover douchebag who’s literally obsessed with her but she doesn’t even gaf about that. It’s just cuz his teammates ex girlfriends boyfriend or some shit, who he has nothing to do with, fucked up their rink.FOURTH OF ALL nobody in this book has any decorum or home training. Why does Anastasia never wear any goddamn underwear to SOCIAL OUTINGS?Nessie went commando to someone’s BIRTHDAY PARTY. And I’m not sure about you but I wouldn’t want my boyfriend sleeping in another woman’s fucking bed because they’re “best friends” *COUGH* RYAN *COUGH*. And these bitches are talking about sex and literally Having sex in Ubers like MANNERS. THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE IN THE FUCKING CAR OH MY GOD.And for a final note: just how much I hate this stupid useless couple😊 Nathan saying he won’t fuck Anastasia when she’s drunk and 1) Nessie getting literally offended by him saying no and going back to being a complete self righteous bitch FOR NO REASON (for a modern day “woke” book the word “no” doesn’t seem to mean as much when you “don’t take rejection well”! (Stfu!!! No Consent is no consent!)) and 2) they fuck literally a couple days after even though she’s drunk AGAIN.

I didn't like the heroine because she was presented as someone determined and focused on her career as a figure skater, but all her actions towards that goal made her look childish and annoying for me because of the way she treated those around her, as if they were disposable, and almost as if she was doing them a favor by giving them the time of day, when at the end of the day she was always the one who came back for more because of that feeling of familiarity she didn’t had before.2. There were too many side characters that I couldn't keep track of, and at some points they stole the limelight in this book, while others became more and more annoying with each intervention (Henry please shut up, you stopped being quirky like 20 chapters ago). Also I don't wanna be like that, but I really feel like the author tried too hard to score those rep points while not even using google translate properly.3. And then the plot dragged and dragged, forever and ever, AMEN. I heard this was a Wattpad story before and maybe that's why the whole plot feels a bit cut off, but gosh, a new conflict after a few chapters? It was a few conflicts too much.

I’m a delight.”my main problem with the main character:she tried too hard to be grumpy.she was also super overdramatic and she swore to hate hockey players bc of a typical stereotype but one interaction and she realizes she starts to like them. the next thing she does is complain bc she was only willing to like henry. it was infuriating and annoying with how she tried hating all the hockey players. her inner dialogue was so hard to put up with because of the way she simply talked. she was WAY too stubborn for my liking and i did not like it at all. i’m so glad she gave up that behavior bc i wouldn’t have been able to stand the book if it continued like that.i thought there were times where i did seem to understand anastasia. she reminded me of monica geller with the way she was described! from her competitive nature to the way she was “compulsively organized”. it’s also clear how she cares a lot about the people she loves. however they differed in many different ways with how “grumpy” she is and her demeanor around new people.a small spoiler for this quote possibly!!“It felt good hearing him make plans for the future, and I could pretend I don’t know why, but denial is useless at this point. Everything he says makes me melt, and half the time I don’t know how to react, so I kiss him, then things escalate, and before I know it, I’m screaming his name and seeing stars.”—this was one of the many examples within this book that shows there’s no plot, it’s justsex driven.overall, this book wasso slow. it might seem fast paced with the events, but it slowly eased into a normal routine of them fucking every other chapter. it becomes so boring to read the same damn thing every time. it throws you off at the beginning just as an excuse to slow down the plot and focus on them doing it. however this book was great with keeping everything consistent. the amount of pages for each chapter stayed relatively the same and they didn’t favor one pov over another!if u saw my reaction while i read this book, you’d be familiar with these quotes.“I swear to God I will leave you in this airport,” Nate grumbles, slapping my ass, laughing when the noise causes an elderly couple to turn around and look at us, making my cheeks blush.”“It’s like he flicks a switch somewhere and suddenly it’s Niagara Falls between my legs.”mid way this book became entertaining. not for the plot, which remainedboring and gave us nothing. but i genuinely laughed out loud bc of how cringy the writing was sometimes & how it gave off wattpad vibes. the writing itself was entertaining. there was so much smut and usually i don’t mind but there was unnecessarily too much in this book. what was the purpose?? i was going to give this book 3 stars at this point. things were looking up and my rating slowly increased. i also liked the banter between the characters! it was pretty enjoyable on my part so there’s thatusually books that bring comfort involve the found family trope, but it’s not as present in this book mainly bc it focuses on friendships between the boys and anastasia, but even then it’s barely talked about there. plus, the main focus was the relationship between nate & anastasia, which in of itself is all abt sex. my favorite part is definitely the cooking lessons that jj and anastasia had together. cutest!!context: literally just gray sweatpants“He’s in a Maple Hills Titans T-shirt and gray sweats, and I hate myself for being a woman swayed by a man in gray sweatpants. Shit. No, there will be no swaying.””Gray, obviously, because Nathan Hawkins is a man who was most definitely written by a woman.”i hate nathan with a burning passion. this is the rare occasion where iWANTEDa third act conflict. i usually hate them butthey needed it!!he was below the bare minimum. i truly have no idea how anastasia put up with him. she likes a man who wears gray sweatpants and claims he is written by a woman. i wear gray sweatpants!! does that make me written by a woman? i would hope so but that’s besides the point.not every person who wears sweatpants immediately makes them written by a woman!spoilers from this point on“You think he’s going to manipulate her into forgiving him and then she won’t need you anymore. You like being needed by her. It makes you feel important. You know Aaron hates you and you think he’s going to keep her away from you. Which just shows you don’t know how strong she is, or truly understand how much she loves you.”“I shouldn’t have to scream that I’m not naïve or being manipulated for Nathan to trust my judgment. I shouldn’t have to beg him to understand that there is a difference between friendship and partnership.”these quotes single handedly ruined this book for me and made me hate nathan.nathan desperately needs therapy.i’m surprised she put up with the attitude that he showed her. i wanted him to be able to work out his feelings on his own so she would never have to put up with a man who cannot communicate his feelings bc communication is key!! instead they got pissed at each other and would put off arguements. then they don’t see each other for a few days and everything is fixed! i do appreciate the boys knocking some sense into him.“There’s a warm, full feeling in my heart when I’m around this team. It’s unfamiliar but familiar at the same time; a contradiction, I know, but so specific that it feels like it was specifically designed for me. It’s the feeling I didn’t know I needed until these guys crashed their way into my life three months ago.”speaking of the boys:i don’t see why people like henry.he made a LOT of backhanded comments to everyone and whether or not he can tell if it’s mean, i’m surprised they put up with him for so long. i do see that he cares for anastasia but from the beginning he was so blunt. there was ONE scene of henry being kind. he wasn’t even funny! he just had no filter and just cannot control his honesty. if he was able to control his honesty, i’d probably like him better.this book was so fast paced for the characters. this all happened within the span of 3 months.3 MONTHS.i get that the idea of the story is supposed to be that they don’t have any miscommunications and have a “healthy” relationship but i’ve found some problems within this situation. they move way too quickly and the way they address it as “we’ve spent so much time together so we’re built different” does not work for me. don’t get me wrong, they had their cute moments but it wasn’t enough to suffice for me.they don’t fight when they’re “frenemies” which i do appreciate but it’s obvious they wanted different things from the beginning. despite nathan knowing what anastasia wanted, they still got jealous whenever one hung out with another person and they didn’t address it. i feel like they sugarcoated everything and it’s clear anastasia doesn’t think on it much simply because she does not know how he feels. i’ve never met a man who’s happy to be her friend rather than upset that she just wants to be friends.here’s where the book gets confusing: they are obviously involved with one another but not exactly in a relationship type way. they don’t even get together until chapter 30. i honestly stopped caring for their relationship bc i was that done with this book. i thought nathan was desperate and i just did not like them together all that much. sure, they can be cute but their whole relationship and personality revolves around fucking one another and when they were away all they would think abt is alone time between them.the supposed “plot” on the back doesn’t happen until mid way. sure, the ice rink breaks as soon as u jump into the book abt 2 chapters in but the second plot point took too long to happen. i wish it would’ve happened sooner to let the book pick up quicker and become shorter. also i loathe aaron in this book. do i really need to talk abt him? i’m pretty sure everyone hates him.i personally would not forgive nathan for what he said at the end. that might just be me being petty but i don’t want to take shit from a man!! i’d deserve better than someone who can’t work out their feelings bc i got my own bullshit to deal with. sometimes i couldn’t see the reasoning behind the things the characters did bc of the way they justified it. sometimes justification works butnot in this case!TW WITHIN THIS BOOK: EATING DISORDERi want to address the eating disorder that is part of the plot within the book but i also don’t want to be insensitive just in case. i just want to say i’m glad it was addressed and talk about! i didn’t like how late they addressed it into the book thoone more thing: i’m convinced them “playing house” is another way of them boning and making it their entire personality for the entirety of a few hours. this book really pushed my limits. it also sounds like something roleplay relatedpre-reviewi had a nightmare i rated this book 5 stars. rtc'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'what in the insta-lovey-wattpad-pick-me-shit-every-trope-in-the-fucking-world did I just read?this review is longer than aaron’s dick yet smaller than his ego.dnf @ chapter 5update:i read wildfire. sometimes i wonder if my lack of brain cells will be my downfall'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Can we take a moment and talk about therealstar of the book?✨Henry✨He was the best character in this whole book, i was practically frothing at the mouth whenever he appeared, I swear if this man was real i would be on my knees.......to propose, get your minds out of the gutter.He literally so cute and rediculously funny, he says what he thinks in the moment and doesn\'t give a damn.For example Nate wanted to talk to Stassie and JJ said lets get some drink (to let them have some alone time) and Henry said why? you have a drink and so do iGod i love that man, and he got like maybe maximum of 20 pages of screen timeLets not forget :"" it was fun staying in Henry\'s room.

Game of Gods - Discesa agli Inferi
",Hazel Riley,4.39,7624,4751,"Romance, Fantasy, Young Adult, Audiobook, New Adult, Greek Mythology, Fiction",694,24-10-2023,"Ricchi e intelligentissimi, i fratelli Lively -Hades, Apollo, Hermes, Aphrodite e Athena- sono i più popolari di nessuno osa avvicinarli, ma tutti li conoscono e li guardano da lontano. Ogni venerdì sera organizzano quelli che sono diventati famosi come i Giochi degli Dèi, in cui all'avversario non si riserva nessuna pietà. Batterli è impossibile.Quando Haven arriva al campus come matricola, rimane affascinata da loro, anche se un po' impaurita, finché Hades si accorge di lei...L'amore che scoppia tra i due è irrefrenabile, ma si rivela ben presto una vera e propria discesa all'Inferno. I giochi a Yale, infatti, sono solo una minuscola parte di quello che nascondono i la posta in palio è alta e Haven ancora non sa che la pedina principale della partita è proprio lei.Un amore indimenticabile, una storia intrisa di mitologia, Game of Gods è il primo volume di una serie che ha già ricevuto milioni di letture su Wattpad.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'Io con questa lettura ho espiato tanti dei miei peccati.Quando mai ho deciso di dare retta ai miei istinti e lanciarmi su un libro che già dalla copertina sapevo non essere fatto per me. O meglio: il concept mi attirava, speravo di trovare del sano trash che rendesse felice la me dodicenne MA QUI C\'E\' LA MORTE DI OGNI COSA BUONA.Non so nemmeno da dove iniziare.Lo stile è inesistente e quando c\'era sarebbe stato preferibile che continuasse a non palesarsi, dire che i personaggi hanno lo spessore della carta velina è fargli un complimento e l\'ambientazione è data letteralmente dalla formula seguente ""*elemento architettonico* + di Yale"". Giardino di Yale, corridoio di Yale, scale di Yale... siamo a Yale, lo avete capito? Cristo, ma almeno provaci a descrivere qualcosa (ah no, scusate, le descrizioni sono riservate alla cicatrice di Hades e ai capelli di Apollo).A ogni parola il mio cervello fumava un po\' di più.Allora. L\'idea del libro è di disturbare la memoria dei fratelli Cullen - Stephanie Meyer ci manchi - per operare blasfemia e accorparli alle divinità greche. Risultato? Da Omero a Euripide, ogni poeta e tragediografo si sta rivoltando nella tomba. Lasciamola stare la mitologia classica se poi la dobbiamo violentare.Praticamente a Yale ci sono questi fratelli, nominati, appunto, secondo cinque divinità greche, che fanno quello che pare e piace a loro, organizzando dei giochi super estremi (seh, gli piacerebbe) ogni settimana e tenendo così in scacco tutta l\'Università. Questo finché non arriva la nostra pick me girl - versione aggiornata e peggiorata della not like other girls - rispondente al nome di Haven (senza ""e"" se no era troppo palese con chi sarebbe andata a finire) che decide che lei è troppo ficah e sveglia per farsi mettere i piedi in testa. Lei è competitiva, lei vince sempre, lei farà vedere ai Lively chi è che comanda. Spoiler: Haven non è una brava giocatrice ma una grandissima scassacazzo e una paracula incredibile.I giochi ti aspetteresti che almeno facessero finta di essere ispirati alle divinità di cui porta il nome chi li organizza, ma ovviamente era chiedere troppo e nel 90% dei casi si tratta solo di spogliarsi. Immagina che mente strategica devi avere per vincere.Dimenticavo: quando non ci si spoglia, ci si mena alla grande tanto che per un attimo Game of Gods è diventato Divergent (o Fourth Wing, per stare su una cosa più recente. Vi dirò: ho rimpianto quest\'ultimo).Senza contare che con Haven il femminismo incontra la sua ora più buia: almeno Bella ci provava a interagire con esseri del suo stesso sesso, qui di dialoghi con altre ragazze ce ne saranno due e uno in cui si insulta con l\'unica che ha il coraggio di dirle di non rompere le palle. Avrei voluto prenderla io a ceffoni dall\'inizio alla fine, figurarsi Athena.Il suo unico merito è di... ah no, non ci sono meriti. Cosa che rende assurdo il perché Hades, Apollo e Hermes - quest\'ultimo fortunatamente non in senso romantico - siano colpiti da lei. Saranno i capelli ramati e gli occhi eterocromi? (Voi desiderate che io stia scherzando ma purtroppo è davvero questo il suo aspetto).La cosa che più mi fa incazzare è che sti 5 fratelli tra di loro interagiscano pochissimo e se lo fanno è per commentare quanto Hermes sia un deficiente o Athena una stronza. L\'unico elemento possibilmente figo del libro, ossia la fratellanza, annullato in favore di scene intere che dovrebbero essere spicy ma sono solo cringe (quella della frutta QUELLA DELLA FRUTTA, roba da avere gli incubi).Perché ovviamente capirete che Haven - e tralasciamo tutti i soprannomi che si becca che mi fanno sanguinare gli occhi - e Hades si innamorano anche se dicono di odiarsi ma in realtà sono attratti l\'uno dall\'altra lui però è un bastardo complessato ma comunque si amano anche se devono starsi lontani e via così per 500 pagine di sofferenza.Gli altri personaggi non pervenuti, a parte Liam, che io difenderò fino alla morte perché sto povero cristo si becca gli insulti a destra e a manca quando l\'unica cosa che si merita sono degli abbracci per il coraggio di stare in compagnia di certa gentaglia, e Percy, di cui non dico nulla ma tanto si capisce a pagina 2 qual è il suo ruolo (è il tentativo di mystery più RIDICOLO che abbia mai visto).Sorvolerò su quanto pur sospendendo l\'incredulità certe dinamiche siano assolutamente folli e dico solo: servizi sociali dove siete? Ma neanche il più corrotto degli assistenti lascerebbe in mano dei bambini a sti pazzi scriteriati di Crono e Rea Lively.Ci sono altre mille e una cose per cui potrei continuare a insultare questo libro - tipo il fatto che tutti hanno la mania preoccupante di ""non staccare gli occhi di dosso"", ""fissare intensamente"", ""squadrare con attenzione"" - ma in tutta onestà voglio solo mettermi in un angolo a piangere e dimenticare di aver mai letto sta roba (e il finale, il finale cristo santo, ho riso come una scema perché l\'alternativa era buttare il kobo giù dalla finestra. Ma che è sta merda?).Ah, voi per caso avete mai provato a bere direttamente dalla caffettiera? No perché Hermes è un maestro in questo ma ancora mi chiedo come sia possibile che non si ritrovi coperto di caffè bollente ogni volta.E con questa chiudo.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Il mio libro preferito è uscito per una casa editrice ed è diventato cartaceo.Mi piace ripeterlo e farlo presente in continuazione, perché nonostante io l’abbia riletto in cartaceo, non ho ancora realizzato che lui c’è e ha un posto nella mia libreria tutto suo.Haven, la protagonista di questa storia, si trasferisce al collage di Yale insieme a suo fratello.Hades, Hermes, Apollo, Athena e Aphrodite sono i 5 fratelli più temuti del collage, quelli che organizzano giochi immorali, di notte, nei dormitori di Yale.Game of gods è un new adult dal genere mystery romance che tratta la mitologia greca ai tempi moderni.La penna dell’autrice è coinvolgente, emozionante, ironica.La caratterizzazione dei personaggi per me è perfetta. Anche se la storia ha solo una coppia di personaggi principali, ci sono stati tutti quelli secondari che sono stati caratterizzati così bene e nei minimi particolari da farmi sentire legata a loro tanto quanto i principali.I giochi immorali dei fratelli trasmettono adrenalina, tensione e palpitazioni. Ho adorato il modo in cui vengono svolti e il modo in cui mi hanno fatta sentire parte di ogni gioco.In Game Of Gods si ride tanto, si piange ancor di più e ci si innamora sia dell’amore che lega i protagonisti che dei rapporti di amicizia che vengono instaurati.Hades Lively è quel personaggio che ha rubato il mio cuore dal primo momento in cui l’ho conosciuto e continua a tenerselo per se. Il modo in cui mi sento legata a lui non riuscirei a descriverlo a parole, ma so che ogni volta che leggo i suoi pensieri e rivivo quello che ha passato, mi sento così piccola che mi viene da piangereLa storia d’amore che c’è all’interno di questo libro è una delle più belle di cui io abbia mai letto, una di quelle a cui sono affezionata in un modo unico e viscerale. Per chi ha letto solo questo, lo sviluppo della loro storia continuerà nel sequel, ma già solo con la lettura del primo volume si può percepire l’amore che lega Hades e Haven.Lui che farebbe di tutto pur di proteggerla.Lei che lo ama più di ogni altra cosa al mondo.«Ki egó se agapó, Persefóni mou» ♡'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 ★perché nessuno fino ad oggi non mi ha mai legato ad una sedia dicendomi “ora ti siedi e lo leggi”?siamo davanti ad un mistery romance con una rivisitazione della mitologia greca ai giorni d’oggi.a Yale, una delle università più prestigiose degli Stati Uniti, arriva Haven Cohen insieme a suo fratello Newt. tutto può aspettarsi tranne l’incontro con i 5 fratelli Lively, ricchi, di una spiccata intelligenza, misteriosi. ogni venerdì sera organizzano i “giochi degli dei” ambientati in diversi luoghi dell’università. ogni gioco porta il loro nome: sono pericolosi, corrotti, giocano con lo scopo di farti perdere. Haven, stuzzicata dalla curiosità, non si lascia sfuggire la possibilità di partecipare intralciando la strada di ogni Lively si trovi davanti, nonostante la precarietà consigliata dai suoi amici.sin da subito la scrittura ti prende, è divertente, ironica ed è una penna capace di caratterizzare alla perfezione i personaggi tanto da rendermi indecisa su quale sia il mio preferito. ognuno di loro ha un tratto particolare che ti conquista: Hermes con la sua sfacciataggine, Apollo per la sua timidezza e gentilezza, Aphrodite per la sua empatia, Athena per la sua determinazione.ho amato Haven perché nella sua sfrontatezza, impavidità, è sempre stata coerente con le sue scelte, anche quelle prese con poca lucidità, e non ha mai rinnegato nulla, anche quando tutto le stava crollando addosso. Hades invece ha una personalità fredda, calcolata, si sfoga su un sacco da boxe e lascia cadere torsi di mela in mano alle persone.il finale mi ha aperto gli occhi sul perché ci fosse cosi tanta complicità tra loro dall’inizio, erano davvero destinati a stare insieme :,)per me sono insuperabili, come coppia, come gruppo di amici, come storia.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'DNFCosa mi aspettavo da questo libro?Che fosse un romanzo uscito da Wattpad, sì, ma diverso dal solito. Dalle recensioni e reazioni viste in giro, mi aspettavo un livello leggermente più alto. Aspettative soddisfatte o no? Leggete la review (di un abbandono).•La trama mi è sembrata un’unione tra Twilight e The Inheritance Games che non è un male perché sono due cose che mi piacciono, in più è stata comunque abbastanza innovativa rispetto a ciò che troviamo spesso su Wattpad.I protagonisti principali non sono i soliti che si trattano malissimo ai limiti della violenza, amandosi in realtà segretamente. Il protagonista maschile puntualizza da subito che lei “non gli da fastidio”, punti bonus solo per questo.•MANon posso passare sopra al fatto che manchi completamente il contesto oltre la storia d’amore dei protagonisti.Quanto è credibile che una persona che frequenta legge a Yale non apra mai un libro per studiare? Se lo fa, non ci viene raccontato.La verità è che non ci si distrae mai dalle interazioni tra Haven e Hades, durante la lettura. Lei ha continuamente in testa solo Hades e i suoi fratelli, i Lively: anche quando è con altre persone l’argomento sono sempre e solo loro.Haven è una protagonista che ami o odi: è intrepida e ha sempre voglia di sfide e giochi pericolosi, parla per flusso di coscienza senza riuscire a controllare quello che dice (anche quando potrebbe e dovrebbe davvero!) e per uscire da situazioni scomode si denuda.•I personaggi secondari sono per la maggior parte abbastanza inutili. A parte i fratelli Lively che compaiono più spesso, gli altri amici potrebbero anche non esserci. Liam è stupido come uno scolapasta (ma frequenta Yale), Newt è il fratello di Haven e riesce solo a dirle “questo non si fa”, Jack non ha una personalità definita, Percy l’ho visto in tre scene su per giù.•Lo stile di scrittura non è prolisso (grazie al cielo) e non si perde in mille ripetizioni. Però manca di quelle scene extra e quei semplici accorgimenti che avrebbero potuto rendere tutto più credibile e coerente. Ovvio che non può risultare credibile un americano che usa modi di dire o espressioni italiane.•È una lettura terribile? No. Effettivamente tiene compagnia, ha un po’ di spicy che non guasta ed è di gran lunga migliore rispetto ad altri prodotti Wattpad… ma non è comunque un libro che riesco ad amare per i motivi detti sopra.Ecco perché l’ho abbandonato a circa il 60% senza voglia di continuare e conoscere il finale, troppi elementi che mi infastidivano mi hanno rovinato la lettura. Mi stavo annoiando.Di solito quando abbandono do sempre 1 stellina, e lo farò anche in questo caso per coerenza.Un libro che non mi spinge a leggere fino all’ultima pagina perde in partenza. Ci tengo però a specificare che non fa schifo… semplicemente non mi interessa continuare a leggerlo.1⭐️🌸Disclaimer: il mio parere è soggettivo e personale quindi in base a gusti, sensazioni e stato d’animo al momento della lettura il libro mi è piaciuto oppure no.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Vorrei dire tante cose su questo libro, ma penso che ogni cosa che io dicessi non rispetterebbe la realtà, quindi mi limito a dire che questo libro è e rimarrà per sempre nel mio cuore.💙Lo lessi per la prima volta a marzo dell\'anno scorso e già mi ero innamorata profondamente della storia, dei protagonisti, dei personaggi...di tutto in poche parole.

Da queste premesse, ci tengo a dire che questo libro per me è molto speciale, non mi capita spesso di affezionarmi così tanto a una storia d\'amore, ma in questo caso, è successo, e non riuscirò mai a dimenticare la storia d\'amore tra Haven e Hades, insieme ai fratelli Lively.💙🍎Per quanto riguarda lo stile di scrittura penso che Mary abbiamo fatto un lavoro eccezionale, non solo perché il libro è estremamente scorrevole e manco ci si rende conto di quante pagine si stanno leggendo, ma anche perché ha avuto la capacità di riuscere a farmi immergere tra i corridori di Yale e anche a farmi sentire parte di tutte le vicende che sono successe all\'interno di questa storia, come se fossi anche io un personaggio all\'interno del libro.

Sarà lunga, mi scuso, ma c’è davvero troppo da dire.Questo libro, semplicemente, non ha senso. Non c’è una vera e propria trama, i personaggi sono un ammasso di rimbecilliti che però frequentano un’università della Ivy League, non si sa come, oltre al fatto che è tutto surreale e assolutamente non credibile, a partire da certe espressioni utilizzate, che fanno capire benissimo che la scrittrice non è americana o inglese, ma italiana (altra cosa che, onestamente, non ho apprezzato - potevi anche fare qualcosa di più interessante ambientando il tutto all’Università di Firenze o Pisa, magari I Lively potevi trasformarli in una potente famiglia della malavita e sarebbe stato meno cringe).La qualità generale del libro è veramente scarsa.Haven è una ragazzina che viene ammessa a Yale con una borsa di studio (che non si sa bene come si sia procurata), la cui madre è deceduta in un incidente stradale lasciando al marito 5 milioni di debiti (che non si sa bene come si sia procurata, anche lei), il cui fratello frequenta Yale con lei sempre tramite una borsa di studio parziale (lui, forse, se l’è procurata grazie alla bravura nei numeri che viene citata casualmente una sola volta in tutto il libro).Ma Haven è anche una irritante e sfacciata bimbetta, che non fa altro che portare le persone che ha intorno al limite della sopportazione, spacciando la sua incredibile maleducazione con “determinazione”, caratteristica per la quale tutti, grandi e piccini, maschi e femmine, finiscono per adorarla come se fosse la sola donna al mondo.Il criterio che utilizza per prendere qualsiasi decisione è il non aver criterio, ma fare tutto a caso, sperando che poi qualcuno la salvi da sé stessa, che sia suo fratello, i suoi amici (con cui non ha neanche davvero fatto amicizia, glieli ha letteralmente procurati suo fratello) o i fratelli Lively.Si spoglia davanti a tutti senza preoccuparsi di niente, ma poi se parlano male di lei ci rimane male perché non ne hanno il diritto e fa scenate.Illude i sentimenti di Apollo per tutto il libro, ma poi si infastidisce se Hades fa lo stesso con lei.Tratta male tutti, ma poi si arrabbia se qualcuno non le dice quello che vuole sentirsi dire.Ad un certo punto si struscia su Hermes come una gatta in calore, ma poi si arrabbia se Hades le dice che si comporta da poco di buono.Insomma, una psicopatica.Non ha hobby, anche se è stata presentata fin dalle prime pagine come una “ludopatica”. Dal dizionario, la ludopatia è la “dipendenza patologica dai giochi elettronici o d’azzardo”. E lei non propone neanche una volta una partita a carte, un gioco qualsiasi, parla e parla e parla, ma sempre del solito argomento: i Lively.Parliamo un attimo di Yale. Nessun accenno alle lezioni, tranne una scena assolutamente ridicola in cui Hades irrompe letteralmente nell’aula in cui lei ha lezione di diritto e il professore non lo rimprovera solo perché è il suo pupillo (nonostante lui non frequenti neanche una lezione, su sua stessa ammissione), si siede accanto a lei come se niente fosse e si mettono a fare salotto, neanche fossero al bar, il tutto senza preoccuparsi di disturbare chi la retta la paga veramente per studiare e senza preoccuparsi neanche del professore che sta spiegando.In tutto ciò, Haven spera di laurearsi in Legge in una delle facoltà più importanti degli Stati Uniti senza né studiare e, a quanto pare, stare attenta durante le (poche) lezioni a cui si degna di presentarsi. Ripeto, per chi se lo fosse perso, che lei, povera in canna, al punto da non poter a volte fare la spesa, ha una borsa di studio per frequentare quell’ateneo così prestigioso, quindi si supporrebbe che mostri un minimo di apprezzamento al riguardo, giusto? No.La sua fortuna immensa, inoltre, le fa dividere la stanza non con un’altra matricola come lei (non sono un’esperta, ma non dovrebbe essere così che funziona?), ma guarda caso proprio con la migliore amica del fratello maggiore, che già è al secondo anno. Che mondo piccolo, eh?La ragazza, Jack, è un’altro personaggio stupendo: ha meno personalità di un comodino dell’Ikea, non mostra interesse verso niente e nessuno, e pure lei non frequenta le lezioni perché è troppo impegnata a dormire fino a tardi la mattina.Chi l’avrebbe mai detto che fosse così semplice studiare Legge a Yale?!Sì, perché studiano tutti Legge, probabilmente la sola facoltà di studio che l’autrice sia riuscita a trovare su internet…Jack e Haven dividono la stanza, ma non si vedono mai, e quel poco tempo che passano assieme non si parlano, anche perché Jack non ha mai niente di cui parlare, salvo poi dichiararsi innamorata di Newt (quasi la obbligano con uno dei giochi dei Lively), che le dice chiaro e tondo che siccome lei era sempre troppo indifferente non si capiva cosa provava e quindi la friendzona. La cosa la colpisce al punto che, già poco presente prima, sparisce del tutto nell’oblio.Anche gli altri due cosiddetti amici di Haven sono stupendi. Innanzitutto, non sono amici suoi, ma di Newt. Lui li obbliga a cominciare a fare le guardie del corpo della sorella, senza alcun motivo apparente. E loro accettano senza problemi, perché anche loro non hanno lezioni da frequentare, altrimenti non si spiega che abbiano sempre gli stessi identici orari di Haven e che possano scortarla su e giù per il campus di Yale nelle sue aule.Peccato che uno dei due, Liam, sia la testa più vuota che si sia mai vista sulla faccia della Terra (non ha idea di cosa significhi la parola “trascendentale”, ad esempio), ma è comunque uno studente di Yale (nonostante abbia dovuto ripetere lo stesso esame 4 volte prima di passarlo…), ed è proprio a lui che Newt affida la sorveglianza della preziosissima sorella. Anche se fin dall’inizio lo irrita che Liam faccia apprezzamenti su di lei (dicendo che “È bona”, espressione tipica del New England, specie nel 2020 🤦🏻\u200d♀️). Ha senso.Il livello intellettuale dei discorsi di tutti questi signori laureandi è quello di studenti delle medie: in qualsiasi discorso si riesce solo a parlare di genitali e rapporti sessuali, il tutto condito da battute squallide e litigi. Ogni volta che qualcuno apriva bocca mi veniva l’orticaria.I Cullen… ehm, no, scusate, i Lively, sono una banda di ragazzi adottati, anzi, “scelti” (vi ricordano nulla…? E se parlo delle mele rosse? Ancora niente…?) da due violenti e più psicopatici che mai, che sono riusciti a mettere su un impero. Non si sa basato su cosa, ovviamente, perché il fil rouge di tutto il libro è il non avere un contesto. Si sa solo che sono così ricchi che in confronto Elon Musk fa il giocoliere ai semafori.I cinque ragazzi sono burattini senza carattere o volontà. Di Aphrodite si sa che è bellissima, ma non si capisce se sia intelligente o meno. È la sorella gemella di Apollo, ma tra i due non c’è la minima interazione per tutto il tempo. Il che è piuttosto strano considerato che sono stati da soli in orfanotrofio per un tempo non meglio specificato, cosa che dovrebbe contribuire a rafforzare un legame no? Athena è una repressa incavolata col mondo, che passa il suo tempo a far passare l’inferno agli altri senza motivo. Anche lei, guarda caso, è bellissima. Apollo, neanche a dirlo, bellissimo anche lui, è un personaggio molto strano: riservato e dolce, ha una cotta per Haven (basata anch’essa sul nulla), ma non la guarda neanche in faccia. Avrei tanto voluto che vincesse lui, mi pareva che ne avesse bisogno, e forse l’intera storia ne avrebbe giovato. Peccato per le “labbra color amarena”, che non è un colore normale per delle labbra, specie se maschili e non truccate… Hermes, forse, è l’unico simpatico. Fa tanto l’idiota, ma in realtà è intelligente. Però la sua ossessione per il sesso lo rende troppo ridicolo, abbassandone il livello drasticamente. Avrei preferito che fosse un personaggio dalla forte personalità, ma asessuale, lo avrei apprezzato di più, anche in veste di “vero” amico di Haven.E i Titani? Non si sa se i loro nomi, Crono e Rea, siano veri, ma se così fosse, quante possibilità possono avere due che si chiamano così di incontrarsi e poi innamorarsi addirittura? Scarse, se posso dirlo. Ma tanto siamo alla fiera del surreale.I temibili e violenti coniugi Lively vengono descritti come bellissimi, potenti e innamorati. Ma poi impediscono ai loro figli di innamorarsi perché è una debolezza. Beh, alla faccia della coerenza.Infatti, le cose si fanno nebulosamente pericolose proprio quando, grazie alla loro onniscienza, vengono a scoprire che Hades è innamorato di Haven e non possono accettarlo perché lei deve essere una loro figlia.Qui la cosa si fa ai limiti del grottesco. Ma forse anche senza i limiti, in realtà.Non parlerò del ridicolo quanto inutile Ballo d’Inverno, non parlerò della scena nell’aula di Yale in cui i ragazzi vengono praticamente pestati come l’uva dai loro amorevoli genitori senza che nessuno se ne accorga, solo perché non ne ho le forze.Ad un certo punto, entrano in scena diversi personaggi inspiegabili e dallo scopo non meglio precisato. Percy, alias Ares, Lizzie, alias Hera e un altro, tale Zeus.Non si sa chi siano e cosa vogliono, ma irrompono sull’isola privata della famiglia che è sorvegliata meglio di Fort Knox senza il minimo sforzo e interrompono proprio sul più bello le minacce di Crono.Ho subito pensato “Ah, meno male, ci sarà una spiegazione adesso”.No, anzi, il tutto diventa ancora più cringe quando, dai contenuti extra, si scopre che Haven in realtà era stata adottata dal padre e la madre (ma lei non lo sa), però la volevano i Lively per primi. E questo non lo hanno mai accettato, a quanto pare…In più, (e qui la cosa tocca un picco che credevo inarrivabile) Haven era nello stesso orfanotrofio, dall’improbabile nome di “Saint Lucifer” (ma seriamente?! 🤢) con Hades, e che i due già da piccoli avevano un rapporto di amore odio. Ma ovviamente nessuno dei due ne ha memoria, anche se avevano 6 anni…Ridicolo, patetico, non c’è altro modo per descrivere il tutto.Ore della mia vita buttate, ma dovevo finirlo per parlarne con la mia amica.

Il libro non è quello che sembraSinossi, marketing e prime 200 pagine lasciano presagire una storia che non si svilupperà mai. Non c’è niente di Dark Academia, non c’è nessun retelling, non c’è nemmeno alcun MISTERO (i.e. “mystery romance dove l’unico mistero è, appunto, come faccia a protrarsi per 700 pagine senza che accada, di fatto, nulla).2. Quanto potenziale sprecatoPerché prendere una bella idea, seppur non originale, come quella di giochi sanguinosi organizzati da una società segreta, e pasticciarla in questo modo? Giochi degli dei: obbligo o verità, strip obbligo o verità, gioco del drago e botte da orbi. Perché qualcuno dovrebbe partecipare se non si vince niente?3. Plot twist senza alcun sensoNo, non basta far succedere cose inaspettate per scrivere un bel plot twist. Soprattutto se le cose che accadono non hanno alcun senso e non sono minimamente state anticipate da alcun presagio. Un personaggio che ho visto tre volte e di cui a stento ricordo il nome non può essere la svolta chiave della storia solo perché fa comodo. Il finale è aperto, ma i dubbi che restano dubito saranno sciolti nel seguito.4. Lei è una ragazza diversa, ma lui non scherzaLa protagonista femminile è scritta in un modo assolutamente incomprensibile. La sua personalità è fare A, e poi pentirsi. Dire B e poi ritrattare. Dovrebbe essere fortunata nei giochi, ma non la spunta letteralmente mai. Il protagonista maschile è il classico energumeno^tm ma lo perdoniamo perché si mette l’eyeliner. Pensavo ci fossimo evoluti rispetto a Ragazzo-che-prende-ragazza-come-sacco-di-patate-per salvarla da sé stessa, ma mi sbagliavo.5. Basta, basta, basta pubblicare libri NON EDITATIQuesto, a mio avviso, il difetto più grande di questo libro. Perché okay, magari sono fuori target. Okay, magari ho aspettative diverse e sproporzionate. Magari non fa per me. Magari tutti i difetti sopracitati non sono difetti per altre persone, ma è assolutamente inaccettabile pubblicare un libro in questa forma. Al di là dei refusi, grammaticali e/o sintattici (che ci sono e sono talmente grossolani da darmi la certezza che non sia stato riletto), il libro ha un problema di passo enorme. Lunghissimo, ripetitivo, pieno di filler. Scene si ripresentano inesorabili, discorsi e addirittura frasi vengono ripetute esattamente uguali in diversi capitoli. Geografia ai limiti del fantasy, per non parlare della questione adozione o della memoria di un bambino di 5-6 anni.Non ce l’ho con l’autrice, ma con la casa editrice che non si è neppure presa la briga di sfogliare il file word e ammettere che certe cose vanno bene su wattpad, non in libreria. Quello che mi atterrisce è quanto sia evidente che non c’è alcun interesse ad aiutare l’autrice stessa a migliorarsi, a darle strumenti per migliorarsi, ma solo a lucrare su un prodotto fatto e finito che era già disponibile online, gratuitamente.Aiuto.Ahia.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Nonostante il mio atteggiamento pregiudizievole nei confronti diWattpad, sono costretta a confessare che, se avessi letto questo libro negli ultimi anni della mia tardo adolescenza, immagino che ne sarei rimasta ossessionata per anni (e probabilmente non mi sarei nemmeno accorta delle incongruenze, delle esagerazioni e degli errori nel corso delle pagine).Il primo volume di“GAME OF GODS – DISCESA AGLI INFERI”è un new adult che fa continui ed interessanti riferimenti alla mitologia greca (una delle mie passioni) e, al contempo, racconta le vicende di alcuni ragazzi che frequentano Yale.Devo ammettere che, inizialmente, con la descrizione dei fantastici fratelli Lively, è stato impossibile non pensare ai Cullen di Stephenie Meyer, ma le analogie si sono ben presto interrotte.Senz’altro una persona della mia età ha la continua sensazione di una storia già conosciuta, maHazel Rileyha avuto l’abilità di aggiungere un tocco di cultura classica e di mistero ai drammi esistenziali e sentimentali e ai triti e ritriti romance trope, con uno stile narrativo tutto sommato coinvolgente e con personaggi dalla personalità piuttosto intrigante (anche se alcuni tendono alla follia).Peccato che il libro si interrompa proprio sul più bello, quando i segreti stanno per essere svelati: per soddisfare la mia innata curiosità ora mi toccherà proseguire con la serie.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Mollato nel momento in cui i sedicenti Dei hanno iniziato a parlare in greco con i loro genitori.“Twilight” ha camminato affinché “Game of Gods” potesse correre, peccato che quest’ultimo sia inciampato rovinosamente nel tentativo di farlo.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Pensare che prima di scrivere questa recensione ho scelto persino di mangiare un KinderParadiso, per provare ad addolcirmi un po', ma purtroppo... è servito a ben poco.Diciamo che la fortuna di questo libro sono i suoi fan di Wattpad, perché se non ci fossero stati loro sarebbe stato bellamente ignorato. E lo dico a malincuore dato che Quiete (della stessa autrice) mi piacque davvero molto, così tanto da valutarlo cinque stelline che do veramente a pochi libri.Il motivo principale di un voto così basso è che, da un'autrice che ha già sulle spalle sei romanzi pubblicati,questa stesura io non l'accetto. Non ho messo una stellina solo perché il concetto alla base è davvero interessante e se fosse stato sviluppato e scritto meglio, se i personaggi non si fossero mossi solo a fini di trama come burattini privi di personalità sarebbe diventato un'ottima saga - e molto probabilmente tra le mie preferite - ma così assolutamente no, non lo accetto.Mi fa dannare che tutti i riferimenti e gli incastri presenti sono quel tipo diinside jokeche adoro sempre tantissimo, ma che siano rimasti invischiati in mezzo alle incoerenze che inevitabilmente si creano quando si pubblica qualcosa a puntate.La fase di editing, che sarebbe dovuta essere lunga e profonda, sembra sia stata del tutto bypassata ed è un vero peccato dato che sono consapevole che le capacità dell'autrice sono ben al di sopra degli bassi standard di ciò che si trova su Wattpad.

Aggiungerei inoltre che le manca giusto un briciolo di dignità, in particolare negli ultimi capitoli. Il protagonista è già più accettabile, classico bad boy che non sa cosa sia l’amore e via dicendo.Un plus per i personaggi secondari di Hermes e Liam che mi fanno pisciare dalle risate ogni volta che ci sono!In linea generale è una lettura leggera, dal mio punto di vista la trama si perde spesso nel corso della storia e ho faticato a trovare un filo conduttore. Trovo che la storyline enemies to lovers abbia spesso scavalcato la trama principale, che si è ripresa con un grande plot twist solo negli ultimi due capitoli.

Se l’avessi finito probabilmente ne avrebbe avuto 2, ma anche qui ho i miei dubbi. Però una lettura che si perde talmente tanto da spingermi a non portarla alla fine non “merita” di più di una sola stella.E mi dispiace tantissimo perché l’autrice a me piace come persona e ci ho riflettuto se lasciare o meno questa recensione. Però alla fine ho deciso di sì, siccome non sto valutando il suo carattere e neanche il suo talento, semplicemente un prodotto che ho acquistato e che è stato fatto da lei.Premetto che non ho mai letto nulla di Mary. So che scriveva su Wattpad, ma io l’ho scoperta su Twitter circa 8 anni fa e mi faceva ridere (perché la trovo una persona molto divertente e intelligente. Una combo che adoro). Quindi non posso fare il paragone esatto tra quello che scriveva lì e i libri cartacei. Non so quanto sia cambiato dal sito al prodotto che è passato tra le mani di un editore. E nemmeno posso paragonare questo testo a un altro pubblicato da lei. Il mio discorso al riguardo rimane solo nell’”astratto”.Detto ciò, questa storia la trovo molto più adeguata a Wattpad che all’editoria. Mi spiego: la bellezza di Wattpad è avere una sorta di bookclub insieme agli altri lettori, commentare i capitoli pubblicati e “sclerare” insieme, formando una comunità. Perciò lì ci sta riproporre la stessa dinamica, lo stesso suspense. Perché stai creando un’esperienza di lettura prolungata nel tempo. E, tra l’altro, più porti avanti il libro e più lettori appassionati hai.Questo però non si applica nel momento in cui tu acquisisci un libro fisico. Perché hai già tutto lì. E lo leggi da solo. E nel vedere 1000+ pagine di cui più della metà riporta scene già viste… no.Non leggo spesso libri usciti da Wattpad proprio perché parto con questo pregiudizio: si rivolgono a due tipi di pubblico diverso. E non necessariamente a persone diverse, ma a un “mood” differente. Leggo sulla piattaforma quando ho bisogno di rilassarmi e quando voglio commentare le repliche dei personaggi, discutere una teoria ecc. Mi prendo un cartaceo quando voglio essere sorpresa dalle vicende narrate. Wattpad è un po’ come le commedie romantiche degli anni 2000 che sulle piattaforme online me le guardo con piacere. Ma so già come finiscono. Invece, non andrei mai a vederle al cinema perché non mi andrebbe di pagare il biglietto per qualcosa che so già. Quindi sì, per me alcune opere sono esclusive per Wattpad.Che poi le autrici riescono a pubblicare e a campare, tanto di cappello. Semplicemente non fanno per me. E penso che questa sarà l’ultima volta che che leggerò qualcosa da lì esclusivamente romance. Proverò sicuramente un fantasy se avrò l’occasione.All’inizio l’idea mi piaceva tantissimo. Anzi, mi aveva presa come pochi libri del genere. Ma tutto è finito verso la metà.Innanzitutto, penso che se la storia si fosse racchiusa in 400 pagine (intendo anche il secondo libro che suppongo abbia la stessa dinamica di tira e molla) avrebbe reso di più e l’avrei portata a termine con tanto piacere. Anche perché la scrittura dell’autrice non mi dispiace affatto. E’ molto divertente e leggera. Quindi anche adeguata al genere scelto (che non è da dare per scontato).Abbiamo la famiglia ̶C̶u̶l̶l̶e̶n̶ Lively: ricchi, misteriosi e che stanno sempre insieme. ̶E̶d̶w̶a̶r̶d̶ Hades è il ragazzo più desiderato di Yale e giustamente diventa l’interesse amoroso della protagonista, Haven. Questi ragazzi ogni venerdì sera organizzano dei giochi rischiosi a cui invitano chi sta loro sulle palle. E Haven vuole troppo giocare e conoscere tutti i giochi perché affascinata da questa idea. Quindi fa di tutto per farsi invitare da loro.Lei, presentata come ludopatica e ossessionata da giochi (della mente, attenzione), si intrufola alle serate dei fratelli per vedere a che cosa giocano effettivamente. Conosce solo 3 dei 5 giochi organizzati (a uno ci gioca anche). Poi questa ossessione scompare (probabilmente perché era interessata solo a giocarci, però a questo punto non presentarla come una malata di giochi perché chiamarla ludopatica e non farla giocare ogni volta che ha l’occasione… è un po’ contraddittorio). Intanto, in tutto il libro lei non gioca una volta a un gioco. Nemmeno a qualcosa tipo… UNO. Zero. E’ riconosciuta come una giocatrice accanita ma non propone mai di fare una partita di… qualcosa. Scala quaranta, scacchi. Boooh. Non pensa mai che vorrebbe giocare a qualcosa. Quindi questa bravura non la capisco. L’autrice ha deciso di presentare la dinamica tra Hades e Haven come qualcosa di giocoso. Ma… a me non è sembrato così. Nonostante ci sia stato scritto nel testo che a loro piaceva giocare l’uno con l’altra. Sembrava solo un flirt tra due persone consapevoli di essere attraenti. Punto.Un’altra cosa che non fa la protagonista è studiare. Nel senso: questa ragazza è a Yale ed è povera come poche. Quindi dovrà essere entrata con una borsa di studio. E come fa a mantenerla? Se l’autrice non voleva inserire lo studio, allora perché scegliere una delle università più prestigiose al mondo? Ci sono due scene in cui lei ha un libro in mano. La prima in cui qualcuno le presta i propri appunti e quando lei li apre vede che in mezzo ci sono dei complimenti in codice. E poi chiude gli appunti e smette di “studiare” (non aveva nemmeno iniziato). E la seconda in cui è in biblioteca e specifica il fatto che studia per solo mezz’ora. Basta. In un semestre lei con 30 minuti mantiene la borsa di studio a Yale. Un genio incompreso.Un altro aspetto molto fastidioso sono i personaggi secondari. Gli amici di lei sono messi lì solo per dire che non sta da sola. Le uniche volte in cui compaiono si parla solo della famiglia Lively. Quindi la dinamica è: o Haven che parla con i Lively, o Haven che parla dei Lively. E boom, 550 pagine di primo volume. Questa ragazza non ha hobby. Se non i giochi, ma solo in teoria perché in pratica le interessano soltanto quelli che riguardano… sorpresa… i Lively.Suo fratello penso sia stato l’unico un po’ più approfondito della sua cerchia. Gli altri… zero. C’è Jack che è come se non ci fosse. E Percy che me lo ricordo in due scene perché ho letto il suo nome, non perché abbia fatto qualcosa di particolare. E Liam… perché introdurre un personaggio così stupido e fargli frequentare la Yale? E non si tratta dell’essere “stupidi” nelle relazioni umane. Ad un certo punto l’autrice ha scelto di introdurre una scena assurda: qualcuno usa la parola “trascendentale” e chiedono a Liam se sappia cosa vuol dire, prendendo in giro il fatto che non fosse il più sveglio della cucciolata. Lui risponde di no e loro ridono. Questa non è neanche più avere lacune nel relazionarsi con persone, ma mancanza di intelligenza accademica. Quindi perché mettere questo personaggio a Yale? Che bisogno c’era? Hermes, ad esempio, dipinto come molto simile e assurdo a Liam, mantiene la sua intelligenza.Vabbè, torniamo a Haven. Penso che sia un personaggio che o ami o detesti. Personalmente l’ho apprezzata abbastanza. Ha un carattere diverso dalle solite lagne dei romance di wattpad. Era curiosa, sì. Ma non l’ho trovata troppo invadente (come ad esempio la protagonista di “love me, love me”). Mi è piaciuto anche il fatto che fosse dipinta come qualcuno che non si guarda nello specchio e si fa schifo in ogni scena, che si trucca e che abbraccia la sua femminilità. Non ci sono molte protagoniste di questo tipo. Normalmente si punta alle pick me girls. E questo è stato un motivo per cui ho continuato la lettura.Mi è piaciuto anche il modo in cui veniva dipinta la mascolinità non tossica di Hades. Il fatto che lui fa la skin care, si prende cura dei suoi capelli e usa l’eyeliner e viene menzionato molto… casualmente. Non è un aspetto che colpisce subito Haven. E’ visto molto normale. E questa mancanza di tossicità mi ha fatto molto, ma moltoooo piacere.Hades poi… palesemente un uomo scritto da una donna. Il che non è assolutamente un insulto. Si aggiunge anche lui alla mia lista di personaggi che mi fanno pensare “ma gli uomini perché non possono essere così?”Voglio solo sottolineare che le interazioni sessuali non mi sono sembrate per nulla cringe e anzi, quasi rilevanti per la “trama”. Che non è qualcosa che vedo molto spesso.Potrei fare una recensione separata in cui spiego del perché mi irrita quando un autore ripete all'infinito la stessa modalità di descrivere gli occhi. Qui abbiamo “ho visto due iridi * inserisci colore * che mi fissavano”. Bastaaaaaaaa. Ma poi, giuro che in questi libri qui sembra che siano solo occhi con genitali che camminano. Così vengono descritti…Il motivo principale per cui ho smesso di leggere è stata la previdibilità della lettura. Perché dovrei leggere circa 1170 pagine per qualcosa che so già? Io leggo circa 40 pagine all’ora quindi, supponendo che non mi distragga mai durante la lettura, ci impegnerei circa 29 ore per leggere tutto. Più di un giorno della mia vita. Per qualcosa che non mi ha fatto dire neanche una volta “chissà come finirà”. E, se qualcuno venisse da me a dirmi che in realtà Haven muore o rimane con Apollo io vado a riprendere la lettura, ad acquistare il secondo libro e a cancellare questa recensione, chiedendo scusa.Se c’è qualcosa che non mi piace nei libri è “la perdita di tempo”. E personalmente mi sono stancata dello stesso scenario: ragazzo triste e incompreso che nel passato aveva “rubato” la ragazza del ragazzo green flag e che ora si contengono in qualche modo la stessa ragazza e lei, come quella del passato, sceglie la red flag perché è più figo. Io dico: ma perché una volta non fai innamorare il ragazzo cattivo e invece di correre con lui al tramonto non vai da quello buono che è sempre stato messo al secondo posto da tutte per colpa dell’altro?Non capisco l’amore per questa dinamica. Né quella degli autori, né quella dei lettori. E sono una che adora i trope con “i can fix him” però questo in particolare mi ha stancato troppo.E, un’altra cosa che non capisco, è il motivo che spinge un’autrice italiana, che ha scelto di scrivere in italiano, rivolgendosi a un pubblico italiano, di scegliere un titolo in inglese. Che cosa non va nel “Giochi degli dei”? Per me questo è e sempre rimarrà un campanellino che segnala che quello che sto andando a leggere ha una bassa qualità.Ma in tutto ciò, se questa ragazza pubblicherà mai qualcosa che mi faccia pensare che sia diverso, andrò a leggerlo. Perché, ripeto, la sua scrittura non è per niente male.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Parto subito col dire che questo libro, oggettivamente, non è da quattro stelle. Non è un capolavoro e se lo volessimo analizzare per bene, i difetti supererebbero i pregi.Quindi perché ho dato quattro stelle?Perché non posso negare quanto questo libro mi sia piaciuto. Non posso negare di averci pensato per mesi. Non posso negare che sia stata una delle letture più emozionanti degli ultimi mesi.E la cosa sorprendente è che questo libro è completamente fuori dalla mia comfort zone. L\'ho letto per mettermi alla prova, per combattere i pregiudizi che mi fanno perdere esperienze di lettura come queste.Ora capisco perché Game of Gods è così tanto amato. Non abbiamo il libro dell\'anno, così come la scrittura non è da premi letterati. Però Game of Gods funziona: ti fa emozionare e affezionare ai suoi personaggi. E in fondo, non basta questo per amare un libro? L\'esperienza di lettura (soggettiva) è tutto ciò che basta. E io mi sono stupita in positivo.Fatta questa premessa, ora vi dico perché GOG mi è piaciuto così tanto. E parlerò anche degli evidenti difetti, perché voglio che le persone si approccino alla lettura con la giusta consapevolezza. Inizierò proprio da questi.Game of Gods è un libro che nasce su wattpad e le sue ""origini"" si sentono tutte. Lungi da me criticare la provenienza di un libro da wattpad. Sono stata e sono ancora lettrice sul sito e ho trovato tanti piccoli gioielli che sono stati in seguito pubblicati.Tuttavia in GOG sono presenti i tipici cliché che spesso vengono criticati dalla comunità di wattpad. E non sono neanche pochi. A partire dalla protagonista: capelli rossi, occhi eterocromi, acqua e sapone, povera. Poi c\'è Hades con il tipico aspetto che va ultimamente, con tanto di vistosa cicatrice. Per non parlare dei personaggi secondari, alcuni delle vere e proprie macchiette che servono solo a reggere il loro ruolo prestabilito (il fratello iperprotettivo, l\'amico idiota, ecc).La scrittura è scialba e pigra. Le descrizioni sono troppo generiche, sia quelle fische che ambientali. Per descrivere gli ambienti dell\'Università si usa la locuzione ""-di Yale"". Il corridoio di Yale, la stanza di Yale, la mensa di Yale, la festa di Yale. Va bene che Yale esiste e la conosciamo tutti, ma questa non è una scusa per non descrivere nulla.Ci sono inoltre delle metafore che si ripetono di continuo. Provate a fare un drinking game ogni volta che viene menzionato questo maledetto bicchiere mezzo pieno o mezzo vuoto e credetemi che finirete in coma etilico, solo dai primi capitoli.Ci sono poi tantissime situazioni e dettagli assurdi e inverosimili. Per leggere questo libro dovrete completamente sospendere l\'incredulità. Molte dinamiche non sono per niente credibili.In più i giochi dei Lively sono quasi da bimbi delle elementari. Io mi aspettavo qualcosa di più estremo, invece sono di una banalità che fanno quasi ridere. In generale i personaggi sono molto più infantili dell\'effettiva età. Per questo per me non sembra neanche un new adult, ma una lettura che va benissimo anche per degli adolescenti.Tutti questi difetti, però, sono passati in secondo piano nel momento in cui mi sono innamorata della coppia.Haven e Hades sono bellissimi insieme. E nonostante tutti i litigi, le brutte parole e i tradimenti, sono una coppia sana. E questo mi ha colpita nel profondo. Io faccio fatica con i romance contemporanei, perché spesso non riesco ad affezzionarmi alla coppia principale. Ci sono troppi romance con coppie che hanno comportamenti tossici.Mentre qui c\'è un amore puro e incondizionato. Hades tiene tantissimo a Haven e e viceversa.Ciò che ho apprezzato di più è che i personaggi sono sinceri fin da subito. Non negano di essere attratti l\'uno dall\'altro, come invece vedo fare in tanti altri libri. Loro si piacciono fin da subito (fisicamente e caratterialmente) e la curiosità di conoscersi è viva. Al contrario di ciò che si dice, non li considero degli enemies to lovers. Non lo sono mai stati, anzi non riescono a stare lontani l\'uno dall\'altro.E questa cura, il voler instaurare un rapporto aspettando i giusti tempi di ognuno, mi ha fatto battere il cuore.Un altro aspetto per nulla scontato è stata vedere, FINALMENTE!, un approccio alla sessualità sana. Vengono menzionati i preservativi (e vengono effettivamente utilizzati!) per ogni rapporto. Non è una cosa da poco. Le protezioni vengono menzionate nei libri raramente, perché si pensa che possano smorzare la tensione della scena.Mi sono quasi commossa a leggere di come Haven e Hades esplicitavano i loro desideri sessuali e non se ne vergognavano. Questi due si vogliono da morire e se lo dicono!Mentre spesso leggo di personaggi che si aspettano che il partner gli legga nella mente per capire subito cosa vogliono (e anche nella realtà).Insomma le scene spicy ci sono, ma sono scritte con grande cura e rispetto. Considerando che questo libro viene letto da molti giovani, sono contenta che si parli di sessualità libera e sana, così da poter dare il giusto messaggio.Insomma mi sono innamorata della coppia, ma anche della found family che si crea tra Haven e i Lively.E dopo il finale ILLEGALE, sono curiossissima di sapere cosa succederà a questi scapestrati.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5⭐️ perché ho aspettato così tanto tempo per leggere questo libro?All’inizio mi spaventava il fatto che centrasse la mitologia greca, ma mi sono detta “perché non darci una possibilità”Mi sono innamorata fin da subito di questa storia. Mi piace il modo in cui scrive l’autrice, davvero scorrevole e non ti annoia.I personaggi sono S P E T T A C O L A R I. Letteralmente, Hermes lo adoro, è la mia vita ed è davvero simpaticissimo (sono contenta che uscirà lo spin-off su di lui). I protagonisti sono belli mi piacciono molto. Non mi sarei mai aspettata il super colpo di scena nelle ultime 30 pagine.Appena potrò andrò subito in libreria a comprare il secondo volume.Consiglio vivamente questo libro a tutti'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 stelle!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""5/5⭐️Era da troppo tempo che trovavo questo libro nella mia homepage di instagram e tiktok così mi sono fidata ciecamente dell'hype e mi sono avventurata tra le sue pagine.Il risultato? Ne sono rimasta completamente innamorata. Non posso che dare cinque stelle a questa storia perché è riuscita, finalmente dopo tanto, a rapirmi ed inglobarmi tra le sue pagine. Lo avrei letto anche sotto la doccia se solo avessi potuto, vi giuro che non riuscivo a staccarmi dalle pagine.I colpi di scena sono uno dopo l'altro e questo ha sicuramente contribuito a tenermi incollata al libro. Come puoi andare a letto serena se l'ultimo capitolo letto ti lascia talmente tanto di stucco che senza nemmeno accorgertene hai già iniziato il seguente?Ma entriamo più nel dettaglio della storia. La scrittura di Mary è avvolgente e molto scorrevole, questo ti permette di divorare i capitoli in un battibaleno aiutandoti, fin da subito, ad immergerti nella lettura. A ciò si aggiungono anche le descrizioni e le ambientazioni, molto dettagliate ma per nulla pesanti, che ti accompagnano ancora di più all'interno del romanzo.Tutti i personaggi sono ben caratterizzati, cosa per nulla scontata siccome capita spesso di leggere libri in cui i personaggi secondari vengono buttati a casaccio nella narrazione. Ogni personaggio è ben distinto dall'altro, ognuno possiede le proprie peculiarità, stranezze, segni particolari che lo rendono speciale e lo caratterizzano completamente rendendolo unico.Ho amato Haven fin da subito perché non è la tipica ragazza ingenua e santarellina che si lascia mettere i piedi in testa dal primo che passa, ne tanto meno quella che cade ai piedi del protagonista dopo solamente due secondi. Haven è testarda, determinata, forte, caparbia e coraggiosa. Non si fa scoraggiare da niente e nessuno ne tantomeno si fa dire cosa deve fare. Mi ha insegnato a guardare gli altri con occhi puri e sinceri e ad andare oltre alle apparenze ai pregiudizi.Hades fa finta di essere il tipico ragazzo duro a cui non frega niente di nessuno ma dietro di lui si cela tanto altro. Non si rende conto che nonostante la sofferenza, il non amore e il dolore lo abbiano plasmato, al suo interno conserva una dolcezza infinita e un cuore grande che nemmeno si rende conto di avere. Mi ha insegnato che non bisogna sempre essere forti, a volte ciò di cui si ha più bisogno è una semplice carezza, un po' di comprensione e uno sguardo privo di giudizio.Un altro personaggio che poco a poco è entrato nel mio cuoricino è sicuramente Liam. La sua ingenuità e leggerezza mi hanno fatta ridere centinaia di volte e hanno reso questa lettura ancora più divertente e scorrevole.Hades, Apollo e Hermes mi hanno catturato con il loro rapporto unico. Ricordandomi quanto l'amore e la vicinanza di un fratello possa essere di supporto, anche per le cose più banali, tipo una stupida torta di compleanno o un commento sotto ad un post di tumblr. A cosa ti serve un fratello se non per avere la scusa di punzecchiarlo in qualsiasi momento o fregargli di nascosto la maschera per i capelli all'olio di Argan?Un'altra cosa che ho amato del libro sono i miti greci che vengono riportati a ogni inizio di capitolo. Questo libro è veramente speciale e sono sicura che ve ne innamorerete tanto quanto me. Quindi se siete indecisi correte ad iniziarlo!Ma questa lettura non sarebbe stata la stessa se non ci fossero state @nena e @nina ad accompagnarmi in questa storia. Sclerare con loro, scambiarsi teorie, ridere e scherzare fino alle quattro di notte non ha prezzo. Condividere una viaggio tra le pagine di un libro è già di per sé qualcosa di speciale ma se trovi delle persone altrettanto speciali allora quella avventura diventerà indimenticabile. Grazie di cuore, senza di voi questo libro sarebbe un po' meno speciale.Ora è finalmente l'ora di ritornare a Yale con Game of Titans e scoprire quali altre sorprese ci riserverà la famiglia Lively.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Inaspettatamente questo libro mi è piaciuto, e tanto. Però dei problemini ci sono.Una cosa positiva che ho notato da subito e che per fortuna si è protratta per tutto il libro è come l’autrice descrive le atmosfere e riesce a trasmetterle, soprattutto nei momenti in cui Hades è presente: un personaggio ben costruito, tenebroso, che riesce a trasmettere un certo tipo di vibes, soprattutto nella prima metà del libro. Da più o meno il 45% in poi ho notato un cambiamento nel personaggio di Hades, come se si fosse addolcito in qualche modo. Rimane un alone di tenebra attorno al suo personaggio ma in un qualche modo perde quel qualcosa che quasi metteva in soggezione non solo Haven ma anche il lettore.Parliamo ora di Haven: un punto a favore perchè non è la solita protagonista svampita che ha bisogno di essere salvata in ogni situazione e non riesce nemmeno ad allacciarsi le scarpe da sola; un punto però a sfavore perchè è insopportabile, in più momenti ho percepito la sua personalità e combattività nei giochi molto forzata, molti suoi atteggiamenti erano semplicemente “troppo”.Un’altro punto forte di questo libro è la tensione tra i due protagonisti, Hades e Haven, che ho percepito in ogni pagina di questo libro, con scene che mai sono risultate scontate o fastidiose. Anche il “triangolo” con Apollo non mi è dispiaciuto nonostante tutto (ci tengo a specificare che il love triangle tropes è uno dei tropes che più mi infastidiscono e che di norma evito come la peste).Il punto più forte del libro sono i fratelli Lively, in più momenti grazie a loro non sono riuscita a staccarmi dalle pagine. Le loro scene erano le migliori in assoluto. Ognuno di loro ha una personalità ben costruita e in un qualche modo unica, Hermes è diventato da subito il mio personaggio preferito (il suo libro è quello che più aspetto di leggere) così come Aphrodite, sebbene in questo primo volume la vediamo molto meno.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'DNF perché non ce la faccio più a portarmelo appresso. Sorry fan, but non mi piace.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'come si diventa haven cohen? ho bisogno del sequel. HADES TI AMOO'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'non ho parole per descriverlo, semplicemente stupendo.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Mi sono approcciata a questo libro un po’ per gioco, siccome già sospettavo non sarebbe rientrato nelle mie corde, e un po’ per grande curiosità, visto che l’autrice mi é familiare sin dall’adolescenza (re: gli oscuri anni di efp e le fanfiction sui one direction). Proprio per questo, é stata una lettura dissonante: da una parte, la penna dell’autrice—particolarmente riconoscibile dai suoi personaggi macchietta e dall’humor un po’ demenziale che contraddistingue la narrazione—é rimasta pressoché invariata (nel miglior senso del termine, perché cambiare ciò che funziona) e mi ha provocato una toccante nostalgia, oltre che molto divertimento e coinvolgimento perché i suoi personaggi sono davvero amabili e ben caratterizzati (seppur rimangano degli archetipi/macchiette).Dall’altra, purtroppo, si sente infinitamente che questo libro é nato esso stesso come una fanfiction ed é stato pubblicato pressoché senza editing professionale: la punteggiatura é così sconclusionata che, ahimè, anche la narratrice dell’audiolibro annaspa nel tentativo di seguire e comunicare il ritmo e i tempi dettati dalle virgole e i punti. I capitoli presentano ripetizioni tipiche di un romanzo a puntate—certi aneddoti vengono menzionati anche tre/quattro volte, per permettere al lettore della fanfiction di ricordarli nel tempo, tra una pubblicazione di un capitolo e l’altro—completamente inutili, invece, in un romanzo, dove non vi è il bisogno di servirsi di tali stratagemmi per comunicare con il lettore. Per non parlare dei tempi di narrazione che a tratti sono completamente fuori strada, con una narratrice principale a cui le cose succedono e non si prende un momento per vivisezionarle nel flusso di coscienza (ex. viene aggredita e, a parte parlarne una volta con il love interest, questo punto della trama non ha alcuna conseguenza su di lei, sulle sue emozioni e sul suo approccio con l’ambiente circostante). La narratrice, invero, assimila informazioni essenziali al risolvimento della storia in modo quasi apatico, il che é particolarmente atipico perché, per quanto riguarda la narrazione più emozionale (il romance, le amicizie etc.) é tutto molto più frizzante e sveglio. Invero, la scrittura dell’autrice, seppur originale, divertente e molto accattivante, risulta acerba e zoppicante in determinati passaggi—soprattutto in momenti di alta tensione o di riflessioni profonde—spigolature del testo che, a mio avviso, sarebbero potute benissimo venir smussate con un massiccio lavoro partecipativo di revisione da parte di Sperling & Kupfer.Per tirare le fila del discorso, seppur le dinamiche tra personaggi e la storia abbiamo un gran potenziale (anche perché, alla fine, mi sono molto divertita), l’adattamento cartaceo di Sperling non ha minimamente lavorato per farlo sprigionare propriamente. Non basta prendere una fanfiction amata e stamparla su carta per renderla un buon libro, sono due medium completamente diversi che richiedono approcci diversi e, purtroppo, ho come l’impressione che nessuno creda in questi progetti abbastanza da impegnarci si più del minimo sindacale. Un vero peccato, soprattutto perché, nelle pagine di questo libro, si sente il pieno amore che l’autrice vi ha conservato dentro, é nelle ricerche meticolose che ha fatto sulla mitologia greca ed é nella dolcezza con cui tratta i suoi personaggi, a mio avviso, da parte della casa editrice, sarebbe bastato anche un quarto della sua passione per plasmare questo testo in un buon romanzo. Peccato.“Credi che ne sappia poco di mitologia greca, ma non è così. Fra tutti gli dèi dell’amore che sono stati nominati oggi, non ne ho sentito uno: Pothos. È la personificazione del rimpianto. E ti consiglio di iniziare a pregarlo, giorno e notte, se vuoi avere la speranza di ottenere il mio perdono in futuro.”'}]"

L'età fragile
",Donatella Di Pietrantonio,3.68,6114,4643,"Italian Literature, Fiction, Audiobook, Contemporary, Italy, Novels",192,28-11-2023,"Non esiste un'età senza paura. Siamo fragili sempre, da genitori e da figli, quando bisogna ricostruire e quando non si sa nemmeno dove gettare le fondamenta. Ma c'è un momento preciso, quando ci buttiamo nel mondo, in cui siamo esposti e nudi, e il mondo non ci deve ferire. Per questo Lucia, che una notte di trent'anni fa si è salvata per un caso, adesso scruta con spavento il silenzio di sua figlia. Quella notte al Dente del Lupo c'erano tutti. I pastori dell'Appennino, i proprietari del campeggio, i cacciatori, i carabinieri. Tutti, tranne tre ragazze che non c'erano piú. Amanda prende per un soffio uno degli ultimi treni e torna a casa, in quel paese vicino a Pescara da cui era scappata di corsa. A sua madre basta uno sguardo per capire che qualcosa in lei si è i primi tempi a Milano aveva le luci della città negli occhi, ora sembra che desideri soltanto scomparire, si chiude in camera e non parla quasi. Lucia vorrebbe tenerla al riparo da tutto, anche a costo di soffocarla, ma c'è un segreto che non può nasconderle. Sotto il Dente del Lupo, su un terreno che appartiene alla loro famiglia e adesso fa gola agli speculatori edilizi, si vedono ancora i resti di un campeggio dove tanti anni prima è successo un fatto terribile. A volte il tempo decide di tornare sotto a quella montagna che Lucia ha sempre cercato di dimenticare, tra i pascoli e i boschi della sua età fragile, tutti i fili si tendono. Stretta fra il vecchio padre cosí radicato nella terra e questa figlia piú cocciuta di lui, Lucia capisce che c'è una forza che la attraversa. Forse la nostra unica eredità sono le ferite. Con la sua scrittura scabra, vibratile e profonda, capace di farci sentire il peso di un'occhiata e il suono di una domanda senza risposta, Donatella Di Pietrantonio tocca in questo romanzo una tensione tutta nuova.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'Io Donatella Di Pietrantonio la vorrei soltanto abbracciare.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Dall’esplosione di Elena Ferrante in poi, tutte le scrittrici, ma anche gli scrittori italiani, hanno deciso in massa di interessarsi a storie dolenti alle periferie dell’impero, dove i protagonisti travolti da traumi e disgrazie grandi o piccoli si guardano passare la vita davanti, nell’inedia e nell’ incapacità di trovare una sola reazione, di fronte al mistero terribile della vita. La pur brava Donatella di Pietrantonio non fa eccezione, confezionando un libro che scorre veloce senza potersi definire riuscito. Dopo questo - l’ultimo di una serie di libri di autori italiani - confesso di aver bisogno di prendere una pausa da questa tendenza letteraria che trovo noiosa e un filo proto- borghese.

Lì, tra i resti di un antico campeggio, si celano i ricordi di un tragico evento avvenuto 30 anni prima.Amanda, ritornando a casa da Milano, sembra portare con sé un'ombra di sconforto.

Nemmeno io ne parlo volentieri, ricordo che quello che accadde quel 20 agosto del 1997 mi lasciò ferita, sconvolta, io che andavo, ero andata senza paure per monti con gli scout, traumatizzata.Ancora una storia abruzzese per Di Pietrantonio, che se pure non è impetuosa e coinvolgente come quella de L’Arminuta, finisce, nonostante la brutalità dell’antefatto che fa da sfondo, per essere più dolce, meno aspra: ogni età ha le sue fragilità, ogni fragilità sembra essere la sola, camminare in parallelo alle altre; ma a volte si incontrano, altre si scontrano, altre ancora riescono a essere l’una il vincastro dell’altra e a segnare insieme la strada da percorrere, a trovare le parole per affiancare le une alle altre.L'età fragile vince il Premio Strega Giovani 2024.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '“Eravamo giovani, ma non invincibili.

FATTO!✅Ecco cosa succede quando, una volta che si leggono gli altri romanzi di una scrittrice e si amano tanto… arriva la delusione perché il libro non è all’altezza degli altri. Ho amato sia #larminuta che #borgosud e adesso… #letafragile è un no.Un libro con una prosa delicata, come sempre, ma con una trama piatta e senza colpi di scena, inoltre su diversi piani temporali che personalmente adoro ma non in questo caso, perché li ho trovati confusionari e poco lineari. Un libro con una storia che non mi ha colpito di per sé, Abbruzzo, montagna, segreti, vite spezzate… anche se il messaggio fine l’ho apprezzato e alcune citazioni che vi ho riportato mi son piaciute. Perché è un libro che affronta tematiche importanti che cambiano la vita di chi le vive.Il titolo e il messaggio che trasmette, ripeto è valido, ma leggendo il libro non è scattata la scintilla, così com’è successo con le altre sue letture. Si mette in evidenza che tutti siamo fragili, sia nella fase adolescenziale che nella fase adulta, da giovani, da genitori o da figli… la fragilità esiste e bisogna accettarla.

E a me tutto questo piace.Ma cosa mi resta del rapporto tra la madre e la figlia? Viene messo tutto in secondo piano per via del fatto principale successo in passato. È come se ci fossero due storie diverse – due libri diversi, che si congiungono semplicemente perché la narratrice è presente in entrambe. Finisce lì.A me piace lo stile di Donatella Di Pietrantonio.

I personaggi purtroppo risultano appena abbozzati, c’è molta poca introspezione. Il tutto stride proprio perché il romanzo sembra doversi basare proprio sull’approfondimento della fragilità di madre e figlia, ma tutto sembra sempre appena detto.

E, come tutte le piccole realtà che vengono colpite da queste tragedie, ne rimase profondamente segnata.Di Pietrantonio mescola la cruda realtà che deve affrontare un piccolo paesino sugli Appennini abruzzesi, dopo il brutale omicidio di due ragazze, al rapporto tra Lucia, la voce narrante della storia, con sua figlia Amanda. O con suo padre, la sua amica d’infanzia Doralice, il suo quasi ex marito Dario. Tutte situazioni diverse in cui emerge la fragilità di Lucia, la fragilità di Amanda o quella del padre. L’età fragile non si riconduce ad un numero specifico, poiché tutti lo siamo, dal momento in cui esaliamo il primo respiro e per tutta la nostra esistenza.Di sicuro, è una storia commovente e struggente, non facile da mandar giù, ma anche per me non è scattata quella scintilla e non mi sento di annoverare questo romanzo tra le mie migliori letture della prima metà del 2024.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Donatella di P. non delude mai con la sua penna ruvida e asciutta.

Nulla mi ha stupito in questo romanzo, dove la voce di Lucia mi è sembrata piatta, dove la figlia Amanda viene sorvolata così, senza dare spiegazioni, letture di profondità. Tutti parlano a mozzichi e bocconi. La sua unica qualità è che si tratta di una prosa leggera e dolce in alcuni casi.

La protagonista, nonché voce narrante, è Lucia: fisioterapista, ha un ambulatorio in paese, è nata e cresciuta in campagna. Apre le porte di casa alla figlia ventenne, Amanda, di ritorno da un\'esperienza universitaria milanese interrotta precocemente. Una camminata in montagna in compagnia della figlia, ai piedi del ""Dente del Lupo"", è occasione per Lucia per tornare indietro nel tempo e ripercorrere una vicenda che ha segnato indelebilmente il suo passato: l\'omicidio di due ragazze, perpetrato da un aiuto-pastore. Un evento tragico, che non l\'ha vista coinvolta da giovane solo grazie a una contingenza del caso. Una natura che diventa teatro di un crimine in una notte, tradisce così l\'occhio di chi la vive.ANALISI, TEMI, PERSONAGGI:Attorno a questa storia, filo conduttore, si configura una realtà contadina, fatta di precise dinamiche familiari, codici culturali, tradizioni, di pastori, greggi e sentieri boschivi. Lucia adolescente è insofferente, vive nella terra e la conosce, ma non si sporca le mani, è in attesa di un riscatto. Il luogo di nascita per gli altri è una fonte di protezione, un locus amoenus, e al contempo falsa impressione e stato di necessità: ""Erano rimasti nell\'unico luogo possibile, dov\'erano nati. Non avevano visto altro, né l\'immaginavano."" La migliore amica d\'infanzia di Lucia, Doralice, nella notte della tragedia si trova insieme alle due vittime, ma riesce a salvarsi, fingendosi morta nel luogo del delitto. Alla sua scomparsa fa immediatamente seguito una ricerca, che è mobilitazione collettiva, espressione di un sentimento di responsabilità: è ciò che lega la comunità locale, in uno scenario di serenità bucolica che viene interrotta. E\' proprio questa interruzione ad aprire uno squarcio, e a mettere - forse - in discussione l\'intero impianto (anche di valori) del mondo che viene descritto. E dall\'esterno il Dente del Lupo viene dimenticato, rifiutato.Ci si chiede cosa significhi essere madre ed essere moglie nelle due storie parallele. Il confronto generazionale si fa sentire: la giovane Lucia deve fare i conti con una madre calata nel sacrificio, che al rientro da una gita vuole affrettarsi a grattare via lo smalto dalle unghie, simbolo di vanità. La stessa donna che, senza fare troppe domande, prende parte alla sacralità indiscussa del nucleo familiare. Eppure questa dicotomia generazionale subisce una riformulazione nella storia più recente, quando Lucia, che ha fatto esperienza dell\'emancipazione, guarda la figlia creandosi delle aspettative, le quali vengono puntualmente disattese, facendo sprofondare la protagonista nel dubbio e nelle insicurezze.Starà accompagnando la figlia nel modo giusto, nel suo percorso educativo? Il percorso educativo è ancora in corso, o è tempo di lasciare spazio? Quali sono le mancanze e le colpe di Lucia? In maniera quasi asfissiante il lettore viene reso partecipe di questi interrogativi, in una richiesta di aiuto. Perché se la comunicazione tra madre e figlia è assente, le domande, le considerazioni, non possono fluire, ma girano e rigirano, e riempiono la mente di Lucia, che è stata la prima a evadere da un modello di vita convenzionalmente imposto.L\'abulia e la staticità della figlia Amanda, tornata da Milano dopo l\'episodio traumatico di uno scippo, sembrano essere a tratti rotte da una forza vitale, che vuole tessere dei legami con il territorio e preservarlo dalla speculazione di un costruttore edile, intenzionato ad acquistare il Dente del Lupo. Amanda sperimenta un sentimento di appartenenza, vuole difendere ciò che è stato e ciò che è. E\' nel riconoscimento di questo impegno che Lucia vede nella figlia una parte di se stessa, e ottiene una fugace conferma di una connessione con lei che da tempo stava ricercando.Figura centrale è poi il padre di Lucia, un pastore, padre di famiglia autoritario. Punto di riferimento per lei anche in vita adulta, dalla profondità della sua pelle dura e dal suo pragmatismo emerge a un certo punto un cenno di esitazione, incertezza, che si manifesta nella necessità di delegare una scelta difficile alla figlia Lucia: il futuro del Dente del Lupo. E\' evidente la fiducia riposta in Lucia e dopo nella nipote, nonostante lo scarto di mentalità richieda degli sforzi nell\'avvicinamento, in virtù del bene.Lucia sperimenta il distacco nel corso della sua vita, si allontana dalla campagna ma il suo passo non può essere troppo lungo, trattenuta, come dice di essere, dall\'obbligo morale dell\'assistenza al padre anziano. C\'è chi va via e sembra trovare il proprio posto, come Doralice; a chi resta rimane un groviglio, e fino a che punto tenerlo in mano è una scelta. Il luogo di nascita diventa a momenti costrizione, catena, ma ecco che è anche attraverso gli occhi della figlia Amanda che quella stessa terra torna ad avere nuova dignità, si riabilita fino in fondo. Quella dignità riacquisita è adesso frutto delle consapevolezza delle azioni che l\'essere umano può compiere nel bene e nel male. E\' reale: il significato della vita, fatta di perdite, di abbandoni, comunque alimentata dal cambiamento.STILE E ASPETTI NARRATIVI:Lo stile è già stato definito da altri ""asciutto, scabro"". L\'elemento cronachistico ha il sopravvento, con periodi fin troppo brevi, martellanti, da telegramma. L\'alternanza tra i due quadri temporali mi è parsa ben bilanciata e riuscita nel complesso. Forse avrei apprezzato una caratterizzazione più profonda del personaggio di Amanda, un po\' appiattita, tra mancanza di volontà e repentina presa di posizione. Avrei voluto leggerne le vicende nel dettaglio, se non il pensiero. Invece credo che il quadro temporale più recente sia stato un po\' trascurato, a dispetto di quello passato; mi è mancato un appiglio solido, come se la vicenda successiva avesse ragione di esistere solo in virtù delle premesse del passato, già esplorate. Una storia centrale lineare (il delitto), costellata da elementi meno convincenti.Sensazioni a bruciapelo: il contenuto è una testimonianza forte. Durante la lettura, però, è questo per me che è rimasto: una testimonianza in un insieme di capitoli, non tali da formare un romanzo, per sviluppo, forza narrativa, profondità e complessità dei personaggi, immagini e atmosfere evocate. Non ho riscontrato uno sforzo creativo, un\'espansione rispetto al fatto. Chi sono davvero Lucia e Amanda? Non mi sento di poter dare una risposta.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3,5 ⭐'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Acquarello su tela, come quando guardi chi ami fare altro senza badare a te e sorridi.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""“Eravamo giovani, ma non invincibili.

Amanda giovane studentessa universitaria a Milano riesce a prendere uno degli ultimi treni prima della chiusura totale, inizierà per lei un periodo di chiusura al mondo a seguito di un evento che l’ha molto scossa.Trent’anni prima sua madre Lucia si trova a vivere a stretto contatto un episodio di cronaca nera che non l’ha vista coinvolta per uno strano miscuglio del caso, il non più tanto notoDelitto del Morrone“A un certo punto la vita accelera. Dopo resta tutto fissato a un'immagine, un suono del momento. Si torna sempre lí.”Ho molto apprezzato la delicatezza con cui l’autrice ha affrontato gli eventi relativi al delitto: gli episodi inerenti la notte del massacro occupano circa l’interezza di una pagina senza andare a scavare nel torbido o mettere il dito nella piaga come siamo abituati invece ai giorni nostri attraverso youtuber e podcast che si occupano di True Crime (Indagini di Stefano Nazi per esempio che di recente ho dovuto interrompere la riproduzione di un recente episodio perché tutta questa pruriginosa curiosità di andare a sentire i più sordidi dettagli relativi a quel particolare delitto io non l’ho provata… - peccato perché ai primi episodi prima che diventasse mainstream avevano un atteggiamento diverso nei confronti della materia trattata);e trovo che non ci fosse modo migliore di come abbia fatto lei per ricordare un fatto di cronaca dimenticato da molti e da tantissimi nemmeno mai conosciuto che imprimerlo in questo modo sulle pagine rendendolo imperituro.L’ho preferito all’Arminuta per complessità di intreccio e qualità delle tematiche trattate ma il fatto che abbia avuto meno riscontro nel pubblico (anche se 50mila copie vendute fino ad adesso sono un ottimo risultato) mi lascia presagire che il pubblico odierno ha bisogno di semplicità e spensieratezza o forse addirittura della minestra già pronta senza particolari sforzi intellettivi durante l’approccio a un testo.Di Pietrantonio riesce a tratteggiare abilmente paesaggi nel cuore dell’abruzzo appenninico con i suoi paesini lontani dalle grandi città con le loro “mancanze” ma soprattutto ponendo l’accento sulle loro ricchezze coniugandoli a una fase della vita che nonostante i cambiamenti operati nella società nei decenni che passano contiene in sé quella fragilità necessaria nella fase di costruzione del nostro se, perché soltanto prendendo coscienza della propria sofferenza e e avendone cura si può raggiungere una libertà di esistere capace di importanti trasformazioni.“Tutto quel male, arrivato dove io e Doralice da bambine ci eravamo nascoste e cercate, con le labbra sporche di fragole. Le mettevamo in grosse foglie a forma di scodelle. Per mio padre era il posto piú sicuro del mondo. Piú dell'autobus affollato che mi portava al mare, o della spiaggia con la gente cosí spogliata.

Vive ormai sola in un paesino di Pescara, quando la figlia Amanda si prende una pausa dagli studi e torna a casa, molto magra e pallida, scontrosa e restia ad esprimere il proprio malessere: le è successo qualcosa. Rocco, il padre di Lucia, coinvolge la figlia nella gestione di alcuni terreni di proprietà, nel paese di montagna di Pietra Rotonda. Ed è così che riaffiora il ricordo di un delitto avvenuto in quel luogo durante la giovinezza di Lucia...È il libro vincitore del premio Strega 2024. Io credo però che, per apprezzare il libro, sia necessario valutarlo aldilà del premio vinto. Questo perché si mostra un libro semplice, senza colpi di scena, dalla trama lineare e ciò che colpisce, a mio avviso, non è la storia raccontata, per quanto grave, ma le conseguenze e le fragilità che comporta, sia per le vittime dirette, ma anche per le persone con cui queste ultime hanno dei legami. Ed è qui che riporta il titolo del libro: una fragilità che non ha età, che può colpire chiunque, che mette paura, che modifica le relazioni... e che rende indispensabile esserci, anche quando si crede non sia necessario: ""In certi momenti bisogna esserci nella vita dei figli, anche se sembra inutile."" Donatella Di Pietrantonio mette al centro la fragilità dei legami: quelli tra genitori e figli, in cui l\'attaccamento materno (in questo caso) rende difficoltosa l\'accettazione che un figlio vada per la propria strada, che può essere anche diversa da quella che si auspicava per lui. Spesso le rinunce dei figli diventano fallimenti per i genitori, ma spesso la felicità si nasconde proprio in quelle rinunce. Ma anche la fragilità di un matrimonio, se le incomprensioni non vengono affrontate con il dialogo; o anche la fragilità di un\'amicizia, se non si fonda su fiducia, sincerità e conforto. Innegabile poi la fragilità conseguenza di un trauma subito, impossibile da cancellare, capace di minare la sicurezza nel profondo... una ferita che richiede comprensione e presenza dei legami più forti. L\'autrice si è ispirata ad un fatto di cronaca nera realmente accaduto nella sua terra, in Abruzzo; probabilmente al delitto del Morrone, in cui persero la vita due giovani ragazze e ne sopravvisse solo una, come nel romanzo. Anche qui entra in gioco un altro tema importante: il coinvolgimento di un\'intera comunità, l\'eco di un delitto su tutto il paese, il cui nome sarà sempre legato a questo misfatto, motivo di tristezza, ma soprattutto di vergogna, per tutti. Il libro è scritto in prima persona: la voce narrante è quella di Lucia, alle prese con una figlia distante ed un passato che continua a bussare. Vi sono così diversi salti temporali, non sempre individuabili nell\'immediato, in quanto ogni capitolo si apre con un personaggio che è possibile individuare solo procedendo nella lettura: forse a sottolineare il labile confine tra presente e passato, quando quest\'ultimo continua ad cessere una presenza rilevante. La scrittura è scorrevole, i capitoli molto brevi, così come le frasi, concise e dirette. Spesso i discorsi vengono riportati in forma indiretta da chi racconta, focalizzando la narrazione su un unico punto di vista.

To claim what belonged to me.""i only sensed attraction but i didn\'t get the feeling they were already at the ""she\'s mine, he\'s mine"" stage. one chapter he\'s acting all nonchalant and cold and then in the next he “desires” her and tells us how badly he wants her and i was like bish when? most of the things he talked about in his pov was about his revenge and a little bit of attraction and with ava\'s pov it was all the operation emotion so them having intense feelings for one another felt kinda quick.their banter was cute the scenes were cute but personally it wasn’t enough for me to be convinced with his new macho man personality towards her. there wasn’t enough depth to be honest. like i didnt get the vibes he cared enough for her to call her “his” because even when he saw her having night terrors in the beginning, i got the vibes he didnt care for her that much and still acted like she was a nuisance.➳telling >>> showingwhen they got together after the first time they had sex there was a lot of telling >>> showing of how they are as a couple and that really bugs me because i\'m the type of person who wants to knoweverything. apparently, they went on dates, alex was suddenly making jokes (?), and they talk through the night but because of the 0 to 100 energy and telling >>> showing, I. STILL. DONT. SEE. THEM. DOING. ALL. THAT. like- what do they even talk about?? and because of this, i wasn\'t really convinced with their “love”, i just didnt feel it becausei wantedallthe details of how they are as a couple and we didn\'t really get that. once they have sex, most of the romance were written in the inner monologue and it\'s mainly because the last half focused more on the revenge plot. also, even the the grovelling was telling >>> showing. noo, i need more.➳Viciousreincarnatedno, but everyone is right tho- i can definitely see the Vicious in Alex. he likes fucking classy women, has insomnia, and has a revenge plan that includes the heroine. i see no difference.➳OW dramadon\'t worry, it\'s nothing bad but i just find it icky when Alex says that the OW fucks like a porn star or when he was about to go on a ""date"" with the OW (don\'t worry, Ava ruined his plans) or when the OW says this to Ava\'s face:""Alex doesn’t do either of those things. It’s well known amongst a certain segment of D.C.’s female population. No kissing, no face-to-face contact during sex. But he will take you from behind. Choke and fuck you till you see stars. Call you the filthiest names and treat you like a slut.""and then Ava thinks this is hot. personally, if someone says this to my face about the guy i\'m into, i will dip because that\'s an ick for me (please blame my virgo sun and my high standards). you\'re telling me you\'re gonna fuck your girl the same way you\'ve fucked your past hookups? ew no thx.-`,✎OVERALL THOUGHTSagain, i thought the romance was cute but it was just ok. the first half was full of cute moments but the last half kinda went down with all the telling >>> showing and i was kinda disappointed with the groveling because of this. like- you\'re just gonna describe how Alex has grovelled for a YEAR in just a page? no ma\'am i want to seeeverything. also, i wanted more scenes of them of how they are as a couple because i just don\'t see Alex being all soft towards Ava.i\'m excited for the next book, aka Bridget\'s book tho! i love the whole princess/bodyguard, forbidden trope. plus, her future mans name isRHYS. that name will forever be sacred so this fictional man who has the privilege of being named after that sacred name better live up to my high af standards.»»━━Twisted series━━««#1: twisted love— ava x alex ➳2.75 stars#2:twisted games— bridget x rhys ➳tbr#3:twisted hate— jules x josh ➳tbr#4:twisted lies— stella x christian ➳tbr'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'OH BOYYYYYYY! LET\'S GOOOOOOOOLet me hype myself up before I write this one.Another absurdly overhyped book. Everyone tells me this series is good and the later books are better. I don\'t doubt it. I don\'t think Ana is a bad writer, her writing is tolerable and sometimes even enjoyable.Can\'t say the same thing for her characters.NOTHINGin this book or even it\'s cover are congruent. Ana thought it would be fun to attemptevery single trope in the history of the universewith a single story, so you can\'t really tell if this is a romcom, a dark romance or just a joke.You get brother\'s best friend, neighbor, nightmare tropes, who did this to you, my parents died or tried to kill me, ex psycho boyfriend, billionaire CEO who doesn\'t date, grumpy-sunshine, family members who want to steal your money and not a single one of these were executed properly. I honestly felt like I was watching a Spanish telenovela.However, I HAVE TO MENTION thebesttrope of all. The one that brought tears to my eyes. The""I AM NOT LIKE OTHER GUYS!!!!!""but I will talk exactly like Christian Grey every time I get the chance. (so he kind is like one guy)Alex, our main character. CEO, billionaire, with an IQ of 190, hates beer, he is not scared of anything, not even bears. Won\'t kiss during sex, because he hates intimacy. He hates birthdays because everyone has one. He thinks everyone wants him for his magnificent shlong. He has been controlling his family\'s company since he was 14, because he was always knew he would be CEO one day and his uncle would listen to his 14 YEAR OLD DEMANDS. He also slut shames his own friends.IT IS LIKE I AM READING THE WORST TINDER BIO EVER WRITTEN.But yet quite possible to exist out there somewhere, the bio under some guy named Rey who lives in Florida and is a republican who hates women.He also says people feared him at 11, because his parents were killed and he swore revenge. It\'s like a wish version of Batman.Except Batman is actually cool.He apparently had a therapist after his parents died. Someone PLEASE GO TAKE THAT GUY\'S license, because it obviously didn\'t work.Alex, and I quote:""Is not a TOY, so don\'t play with him unless you want to get hurt"" WHAT KIND OF FUCKING TOYS WERE YOU PLAYING WITH WHEN YOU WERE A CHILD YOU PSYCOPATH.But yeah, Alex\'s broken record was to please: ""stop trying to humanize me, I am your bad guy."" He also guarantees people that""biological reactions can be mastered""Good fucking luck next time you have to sneeze BRO. Hope you don\'t fucking explodeOur female main character was the SUNSHINE OF THE PARTY! The most giggly adorable girl who apparently ""fucks like a porn star"" (this author had a really really really weird obsession with porn stars since she mentioned them not once, but four times during her entire book)Our FMC had her own mother try to drown her, then proceeded to kill herself from guilt. Her ex cheated on her multiple times, abused her physically BUT SHE IS SUUUUUUUUUCH A SUNSHINE and all she needs is to get dicked down to still see the good in people. Fuck therapy.It\'s so hilarious that in the desperate need to make this book a tiktok sensation... she added so many things that absolutely don\'t go together for the sake of hype, but guess what? Tiktok is that predictable.She succeeded.Now, moving on to the sex scenes. Probably the most hilarious thing I have ever read in my life. Christian Grey comparison aside, we get the most AMAZING LINES I HAVE EVER READ in my book blogger career.""I am turning you into my fuck doll""(?????????????? I mean if you want herunresponsive... I have something to tell ya...We might need to call you a new therapist, or maybe get you into jail.I haven\'t decided yet.)He literally describes the view of her on his bed as a:""sacrificial virgin waiting defilement""Every time she puts her hand on his dick, she""can feel the power it emanates"".I mean, by all means, put a cape on it and give it a marvel contract.Well, anyways... a bunch of stupid things happen, this book is MASSIVELY long for some UNKNOWN reason, just like Alex\'s penis. Near the end, our HEROOOOO threatens the mean girl to destroy HER company, because he has that sort of power, if she doesn\'t tell him where his girlfriend is. It has the same energy as:""my daddy is a lawyer""in third grade.It pains me to say this entire review constitutes of quotes from this book, because honestly? It\'s all I needed.

On one hand, I really liked this book but on the other, I really didn’t. I will try to be as thorough as I possibly can in this review so let’s get on with it...🔹What I liked:✏Characters:〰 Here’s the thing, I liked the characters, I really did. Both Ava and Alex were loveable and the side characters were also interesting and intriguing. I even liked Bridget and wasn’t bothered by the fact that she was aliteralprincess (which, granted, is utterly unbelievable but I still found that aspect to be amusing despite its utter incredulity).✏Tropes:〰 The writing style was good and the book literally had all the tropes that I usually adore (brother’s best friend, grumpy/sunshine pairing...) and they were actually well done.〰 I really liked the fact that Ava’s brother did not forgive Alex at the end. Honestly, I thought that was very realistic considering Alex’s betrayal of their friendship and the way he manipulated both Josh and Ava. I also found that aspect quite refresh since it leaves their friendship open for further development later on in the series (in Josh and Jules’ book).✏Representation:〰 We have a beautiful Asian heroine and a hero of Ukrainian descent, which we just love to see. I also really appreciated all the small details that the author included to help us learn more about the Chinese culture; that aspect was honestly well done and seamlessly integrated in the story.〰 The first half of the book was really entertaining and I was sure that this would become a very fun and quick read for me. The second half however is where things started to go south in my opinion and this is why...🔹What I did not like:✏Plot:〰 During the second half of the book I started getting the feeling that I was watching a bad soap opera. Things started becoming incredibly unbelievable and cheesy. For instance, the whole thing with Ava’s father was such a cliché that I was honestly surprised that none of the author’s beta readers had told her to cut out this “plot twist”. The writing in these instances also needed rework since they reinforced the feeling that I was watching a Disney villain giving his speech and congratulating himself on his wickedness. This is an example of what I mean:“Michael’s face remained anguished for several more seconds before it twisted and morphed into a hideous mask. His eyes gleamed with delighted malice, and his mouth spread into a mocking smile. [...] ‘Bravo’. He slow-clapped. ‘I almost had you,’ he told me. ‘You should’ve seen yourself’I swear, Mrs. James was real,’he mimicked, laughing.”〰 And don’t even get me started on how Micheal was the man who supposedly killed his parents only to find out that Alex’s uncle was actually behind the whole thing. I would genuinely be shocked if anyonewasshocked by this “turn of events”.✏Aspects of the writing style and characterization:〰 And this is what I personally think was my biggest issue with this book. The novel does an awful lot of ‘telling’ instead of ‘showing’. Both characters go from not knowing each other to being madly in love in a short amount of time. And the thing is? They’ve supposedly been seeing each other and getting to know each other for months by that point. But we as readers are only told of this passage of time instead of shown the moments that they spent together. This is not something that can work in a romance novel. We need to see the main characters slowly opening up to each other and starting to like each other in order for us to believe in their romance. This is why some romances that are set within the span of a single week work. Because its not about how many months the main characters have known each other, it’s about how valuable and detailed each interaction between the two is.〰 This happened once again when it came to the groveling aspect. A literalyearpasses in which the hero is supposedly groveling and begging the heroine to take him back. However, readers are once again not shown any part of said groveling. This is what I mean:“Alex and I had developed a new... well, I wasn’t sure if I could call it a friendship, but it was a step up from whatever we had when he arrived in London a year ago.”〰 Ummm, I’m sorry what? You can’t go from having the heroine say that she will never forgive the hero to having her say something like ‘Alex and I developed a friendship over the past year’. If you do that then you can’t expect your readers to believe in the legitimacy of said friendship because guess what (and I cannot stress this enough):👏Passage of time alone does not a convincing relationship make.👏We need to see the development between the characters in order to root for them because frankly? By that point I neither believed in Ava and Alex’s love nor did I believe in Alex’s remorse because I hadn’t been able to see him truly grovel. That said, I honestly hope that this aspect of the novel gets better in the second installment.🔹Final thoughts:〰 If you read any of my ‘pre-reading’ updates then you know that I had incredibly high expectations for this book. I had never read any of this author’s works before but this novel contained all of the tropes that I usually adore. The snippets that I saw on the author’s instagram page also reinforced my belief that this was definitely a book that I would enjoy. Hell, when I first added this on Goodreads it literally only had about 20 or 25 other people who had also added it (so I truly found it very early on). That said, while I wouldn’t necessarily say that I was disappointed or let down by the execution in this book (because, as I previously mentioned, I enjoyed many aspects of it), I will still say that I think many things needed rework and further editing.〰 Finally, I do think that I might read the sequel since I truly enjoyed the friendship group in here and I do think that this author has a lot of potential. So do I recommend this book? I think this could be the perfect example of a guilty pleasure read in my opinion. Many things needed to be done differently but this wasn’t a horrible read in any way.———————Instagram:https://www.instagram.com/rose_books2/—————————————————————————-PRE-READING UPDATES:———————-Ok but I just stalked the author’s instagram and now I’m pretty freaking excited about this😩———————-Mmmm I think I’m intriguedFr tho, gotta love the grumpy/sunshine trope loll.'}]"

White Nights
",Fyodor Dostoevsky,4.07,214668,4502,"Fiction, Russian Literature, Short Stories, Russia, Romance, Literature, Novels",82,01-01-1848,"White Nights is a short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky that was published in 1848. Set in St. Petersburg, it is the story of a young man fighting his inner restlessness. A light and tender narrative, it delves into the torment and guilt of unrequited love. Both protagonists suffer from a deep sense of alienation that initially brings them together. A blend of romanticism and realism, the story appeals gently to the senses and feelings.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""This story, really a novella, is the one I use to introduce people to Dostoyevsky. If you like White Nights you will like Fyodor Mikailovich, I think, and if you don't you won't. In it we're introduced to a charming intelligent young man who lives on the edges of St. Petersburg life, a shy dreamer who spends almost all his time alone. The life of his observations and imagination is very full, however. He daydreams in 3d with vivid colors passionate intricate tales that engross him completely, to the point that an actual friend knocking on his door to say hello flusters him totally, leaving him nonplussed for the entire short awkward visit. Dostoyevsky, in his brilliant way makes me care deeply about our hero, and feel a total sense of identification with him.One day, our protagonist meets an actual real-life girl, one whose temperment and situation in life are something like his. They become great friends immediately, something that has never happened to him before. The story takes off at this point, piling up so much light and darkness that I'm gasping for breath all the way through until the magnificent ending.It's extraordinary the way Dostoyevsky can make all of us feel so much identification with his characters. I feel each time I read this story that he's plumbed the secret depths of my soul that not even I had any idea of. He slices me apart and puts me back together so that I'm somebody totally new after he's done. I feel as though he's writing about me and only me, through a century and a half of time travel and a thorough reading of my subconscious mind, and I do feel exposed by it.My son's aunt who studied Russian literature in Russia says Dostoyevsky is evil, because he cuts us open and has a poke round our deepest selves with such complete and utter honesty.

The world opens itself up into lush landscapes teeming with life and the nights, so full of star light and mystery, seem as vast as the aspirations of first time lovers. Anything seems possible amidst the summer nights, as if the afterhours were a doorway that takes you into a fairy tale world where magic and mayhem await you. Such is the feeling permeating Fydor Dostoevsky’White Nights, an early tale first published in 1848 of a nameless narrator coming to life and love under the white nights of St. Petersburg. ‘I am a dreamer,’ he tells us and embarks on a story that feels as if set in a dreamscape, softly pulling us through the four nights he spends talking with the young Nastenka whom he met sobbing upon a bridge. Over these few days the pair come to know each other fondly, and despite his promise to not fall in love with her as she is engaged to another man, our narrator can’t help but blissfully trip into romantic affection in what seems Doestoevksy’s portrayal and preference of altruistic love. Learning to look and live outward instead of inwardly dreaming, the narrator breaks from isolation and sees that although living towards dreams may go awry, having lived in the world is better than loneliness.‘It was a wonderful night, such a night as is only possible when we are young, dear reader.’I love a good story that takes place over the span of a mere few days, the type that reminds you how life seems to slow down with every moment elevated and vibrating with implied importance when you feel like you’ve stumbled into a narrative within your own life. A handful of days you feel you’ve occupied more than entire months.White Nightsexcellently embodies this and you feel, as the reader, the feverish excitement of the narrator as if it is running through your own veins and not his; a talent of Dostoevsky’s I first became enamored with long ago while readingCrime and Punishmentis his ability to transpose the characters emotions onto you such was the intensity of guilt and anguish I felt alongside Raskolnikov as he sweated in his bed. I was also particularly empathetic to his account of feeling left behind and in a state of a ‘strange anguish,’ finding himself befriending his own city as he wandered the streets aimlessly. I recall a time when I had my own personal loneliness and sadness, spending summer days wandering my own city and finding a particular joy and camaraderie with the landscape one can only enter when out within it walking. The poets have written on this for centuries. Another phenomenon of walking and thinking, especially in summer, is that the whole world feels possible and that around any corner everything might change, fall into place, or trigger a story. And so this tale begins.‘I am a dreamer. I know so little of real life that I just can't help re-living such moments as these in my dreams, for such moments are something I have very rarely experienced.’While perhaps not much occurs in this story, we also feel that it shifts the entirety of the narrators world, he who upon his first conversation with Nastenka admits ‘I will no longer think so badly of myself as I have done at times,’ simply because he had an experience with her. There is a real youthfulness blossoming on every page here with our narrator, somewhere in his twenties but feeling life already leaving him behind, and his loquacity is only matched by his awkwardness. Luckily she find him charming, sharing her own feelings of loneliness spending her days quite literally pinned to her grandmothers dress since the elder woman fears Nastenka will be taken off by a man (a bit on the nose but it works), and is more amused than bemused by his poetic way of rambling. Upon his first explanation of himself she remarks ‘You talk as though you were reading it out of a book.’ Its this sort of inability to temper one’s awkward excitement coupled with a penchant for poetic flourishing that first marks him as a dreamer, but also reminds me of the characters in earlyKnut Hamsunworks, particularlyHungerwhen the narrator’s romantic prospects are dashed by the self sabotage of his grand speeches.Hungeralways recalled Doestoevksy’s narrator fromNotes from Undergroundand inWhite Nightswe see Dostoevsky practicing the sort of long-winded storytelling he would later use for his underground man.‘I don’t know how to be silent when my heart is speaking.’A dreamer, our narrator tells us ‘is not a human being, but a creature of an intermediate sort.’ He lives his life dreaming but never truly living, inventing all sorts of wishes he can play out in his head but never actually having the experiences beyond imagination (perhaps one may see a dreamer as a sort of step-sibling to a reader). He casts himself as the ‘hero’ in his telling, just as in his dreaming, but is nothing but a spectator speculating. And while he has charmed himself with many fantasies of love and lovers, he has never truly known it firsthand and is beginning to regret occupying his time with what amounts to nothing.‘Because at moments like that I start to think that I am incapable of living a proper life, I seem already to have lost any sort of judgment, any apprehension of the real and actual; because after all, I have cursed my very self; because after my nights of fantasy come moments of sobriety which are appalling…after all one matures, outgrows one’s former ideals: they are shattered into dust and fragments; and if you have no other life, it behooves you to construct one from those same fragments.’At least with Nastenka he isexperiencinglife. She too has a story to tell, one of a man to whom she is promised to be wed upon his return to St. Petersberg yet he has been home a few days and has not come to her. Our dreamer, eager to please and to experience life, agrees to take a letter to him. In his dealings with Nastenka we see a sort of idyllic, altruistic purity to his love, one of a boy who puts her best interests before himself and she with no intent to deceive or use him. It feels very much like high school, doing something for your crush in a tale of unrequited love where, deep down, you know they will never be with you but you do it anyway.‘But to imagine that I should bear you a grudge, Nastenka! That I should cast a dark cloud over your serene, untroubled happiness; that by my bitter reproaches I should cause distress to your heart, should poison it with secret remorse and should force it to throb with anguish at the moment of bliss; that I should crush a single one of those tender blossoms which you have twined in your dark tresses when you go with him to the altar…. Oh never, never! May your sky be clear, may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful heart!’It is, perhaps, what a youth would be snickered at by peers and teased for being ‘friend-zoned’, but we see that there is a sincerity here. We also see why the subtitle for this tale is ‘A sentimental story from the diary of a dreamer’ because it is indeed sentimental and tugs heartstrings that reverberate in the tune of nostalgia and young, doomed romance.Of course our young narrator, against her wishes to not fall in love with her, does, but in her grief over the continued absence of her fiancée, she begins to bend her heart towards him as well. Why not, he clearly cares for her. The story takes a twist and we see our dreamer sad but not regretful, because he has experienced life. And life comes with loss as much as love, we just only hope the scales tip more towards sweetness when we tally up our total when the curtain falls for us. We leave the dreamer as he ponders if this one moment of happiness was worth it all.‘My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man’s life?’Doestoevsky forever holds a special place in my heart. While some authors tear out your heart, tear it to pieces and build you back stronger, Dostoevksy achieves the same results in a different way. He shows you inside your own heart and, in recognizing his words capturing inner feelings your own heart could never have expressed so eloquently, it begins to shake and vibrate in harmony with his ideas until it flies into pieces. Then he puts you back together, wiser and thankful for it.White Nightsis a minor work yet it hits so soothingly and with all the bliss of a grand summer’s night. This is one for, as Kermit the Frog once sang, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.5/5‘[A]sk yourself again: what have you done with your best years, then?

It’s as if the sun that warms the rest of the city never shines on them, and instead another sun, especially designed for them, supplies them with a different light. In those corners, Nastenka, a life goes on quite unlike the one seething around us, a life that is possible in some far-away dreamland but certainly not here in our over-serious time. That life is a mixture of something out of pure fantasy ardently idealistic, with, alas, something bleak and dull and ordinary, not to say outright vulgar.”And she recounts him her naive life story too… And, of course, the dreamer falls in love… And, of course, his love is doomed…Judging by the naivety of the narration the accidental encounter is just another dreamer’s reverie – no more than an amorous castle in the air…“And how effortlessly, how naturally the dreamer’s world of fantasy springs up!

The short story is divided into six sections: First Night, Second Night, Nastenka\'s Story, Third Night, Fourth Night, Morning.First Night:The narrator describes his experience walking in the streets of St. Petersburg. He loves the city at night, and feels comfortable in it. He no longer feels comfortable during the day because all the people he is used to seeing are not there. He drew his emotions from them: if they were happy, he was happy; if they were despondent, he was despondent. ...Second Night:On their second meeting, Nastenka seeks to find out more about him. He tells her that he has no history because he has spent his life utterly alone. When she presses him to continue, he suggests that he is of the type of the ""dreamer"". ""\'The dreamer\'"", he explains, ""is not a human being, but a creature of an intermediate sort."" He gives a long speech (in a style that anticipates that of the Underground Man in Notes from Underground), about his longing for companionship, leading Nastenka to comment ""...you talk as if you were reading from a book"". He begins to tell his story in the third person, calling himself ""the hero"". This ""hero"" is happy at the hour when all work ends and people walk about. He references Vasily Zhukovsky and mentions ""The Goddess of Fancy"". ...Nastenka\'s Story:Nastenka tells the narrator her story. She grew up with her strict grandmother who gave her a largely sheltered upbringing. Her grandmother\'s pension being too small, they rent out their house to gain income. When their first lodger dies, he is replaced by a younger man. The young man begins a silent courtship with Nastenka, often giving her a book so that she may develop a reading habit. She takes a liking to the novels of Sir Walter Scott and Aleksandr Pushkin. ...Third Night:The narrator gradually realizes that despite his assurance that their friendship would remain platonic, he has inevitably fallen in love with her. He nevertheless helps her by writing and posting a letter to her lover, and conceals his feelings for her. They await his reply to the letter or his appearance, but Nastenka grows restless at his absence and takes comfort in the narrator\'s friendship. ...Fourth Night:Nastenka despairs because she knows that her lover is in Petersburg but hasn\'t contacted her. The narrator continues to comfort her, for which she is extremely grateful, leading him to break his resolve and confess his love for her. Nastenka is disoriented at first, and the narrator, realizing that they can no longer continue to be friends in the same manner, insists on never seeing her again. She urges him to stay, and suggests that their relationship might become romantic some day, but that she wants his friendship in her life. ...Morning:The final section is a brief afterword about a letter he receives from Nastenka, in which she apologizes for hurting him and insists that she would always be thankful for his companionship. She also mentions that she will be married within a week and hopes that he will come. The narrator breaks into tears upon reading the letter. Matryona, his maid, interrupts his thoughts by telling him she has finished cleaning the cobwebs. ...عنوانهای چاپ شده در ایران: «شبهای سپید»؛ «شبهای روشن»؛ «شبهای روشن و نازک دل»؛ نویسنده: فئودور

His entire life has been like that. That is pretty much how he lived his life, and he does not mind it, not at all, he in fact, likes it.“I am a dreamer. I know so little of real life that I just can\'t help re-living such moments as these in my dreams, for such moments are something I have very rarely experienced. I am going to dream about you the whole night, the whole week, the whole year. I feel I know you so well that I couldn\'t have known you better if we\'d been friends for twenty years. You won\'t fail me, will you? Only two minutes, and you\'ve made me happy forever. Yes, happy. Who knows, perhaps you\'ve reconciled me with myself, resolved all my doubts.When I woke up it seemed to me that some snatch of a tune I had known for a long time, I had heard somewhere before but had forgotten, a melody of great sweetness, was coming back to me now. It seemed to me that it had been trying to emerge from my soul all my life, and only now.”“A fresh dream-fresh happiness! A fresh rush of delicate, voluptuous poison! What is real life to him ! To his corrupted eyes we live, you and I, Nastenka, so torpidly, slowly, insipidly; in his eyes we are all so dissatisfied with our fate, so exhausted by our life""! And, truly, see how at first sight everything is cold, morose, as though ill-humoured among us. . . . Poor things! thinks our dreamer. And it is no wonder that he thinks it! Look at these magic phantasms, which so enchantingly, so whimsically, so carelessly and freely group before him in such a magic, animated picture, in which the most prominent figure in the foreground is of course himself, our dreamer, in his precious person.”But suddenly and quite unexpectedly, life throws something at the dreamer, and he is quite thrilled about it. He starts to think that reality is not that bad after all― that it all finally makes sense, that maybe he does not need― not anymore, to make shelter from reality in his/her dreams. Reality― for once, has become better.Soon enough though, the cruel realization comes to him, he realizes it is not meant to last. This whole thing was a mere interlude in his/her endless world of dreams.The dreamer is not bitter, nor s/he is resentful. S/he accepts it. This little interlude has made his/her life.“In the end, you feel that your much-vaunted, inexhaustible fantasy is growing tired, debilitated, exhausted, because you\'re bound to grow out of your old ideals; they\'re smashed to splinters and turn to dust, and if you have no other life, you have no choice but to keep rebuilding your dreams from the splinters and dust. But the heart longs for something different! And it is vain to dig in the ashes of your old fancies, trying to find even a tiny spark to fan into a new flame that will warm the chilled heart and bring back to life everything that can send the blood rushing wildly through the body, fill the eyes with tears--everything that can delude you so well!”At the end, it all boils down to this trice; a single little moment of sober happiness.“My God, a whole moment of happiness!

He tells his story of loneliness and unrequited love. The story deals with four nights and a day of his life in which he speaks of how his lonely life was changed forever by the meeting of a young woman and falling in love with her. The love remains unrequited as the young woman is already in love with another, but he is not angry nor he is in despair when he says""may you be forever blessed for that moment of bliss and happiness which you gave to another lonely and grateful heart! My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man\'s life.""Although the story is simply about a young man\'s loneliness and unrequited love, what is really amazing is the way his emotions and emotional struggle is described so masterfully by Dostoyevsky. This\'sentimental story from the diary of a dreamer\'talks about a life of a loner, how he immersed in his imaginary and dream world to avoid the harsh reality of his loneliness; how his life is changed from dream to reality with the meeting of a young woman, as he falls in love and feels there is a dear heart who cares for him and that he is no longer alone; and how, when his love was not returned by the young woman, once again turn to a dream world from reality where he finds consolation in the moment of happiness he experienced as being enough to sustain for his whole life.The entire writing is superbly done that the reader feels that Dostoyevsky is telling your own story. I believe, all the youth, irrespective of time, country, and culture, go through similar emotional stages that this young man in the story goes through. For this reason, the story feels so close to the reader\'s heart.There is absolutely no word to describe the brilliance of Dostoyevsky.

En su etapa inicial, entre 1846 y 1847 fueron apareciendo varios escritos que nos mostraron la temprana narrativa de Dostoievski muy inclinada hacia el amor y la compasión. El tratamiento al intercambio epistolar en ""Pobres Gentes seguiría en otros relatos como ""El señor Projarchin"" y en la sufrida historia de ""Nietochka Nezvánova"", que apareciera ya en 1849.""Noches Blancas"" es el epitome del romanticismo en estado puro y una de las más claras muestras de amor, soledad y ensoñación y esto reside en que el Dostoievski más joven, exclamaba lo mismo que esa canción que dice ""yo vengo a ofrecer mi corazón"". Este Dostoievski se encuentra no muy lejos de experimentar las épocas más duras de su vida, como el arresto por integrar parte de un grupo revolucionario que conspiraba contra el Zar y su posterior simulacro de fusilamiento y prisión en Siberia durante cuatro años.Sus tempranas lágrimas derramadas al leer poemas de Pushkin o apasionadas novelas de Goethe y Schiller forjarían una especial sensibilidad en su talento literario a la hora de escribir.Pero este joven Fiódor de 1848 nos regala una pequeña nouvelle de cuatro noches y una mañana en la que un narrador sin nombre, un soñador del que podrán decir que es un soñador, pero no el único, se cruza con Nasténka y a partir de allí, su triste y solitaria vida girará hacia un instante supremo de felicidad como él declama al final, más allá de que su amor, independientemente de la carta de Nasténka no le es correspondido.Su ingenuidad es digna de destacar, pero nos deja un cierto sinsabor puesto que a pocas páginas del final nos imaginamos otro destino para estos dos personajes.No es la única vez que Dostoievski juega con amores no correspondidos. En otras dos novelas suyas sucede lo mismo entre dos de los personajes principales.En primer lugar en el magnífico ""Humillados y Ofendidos"", cuando en las líneas finales el personaje principal, Vania lee los ojos de Nastaha y declama:«Podríamos haber sido tan felices juntos», así también como en otra de sus primeras y desconocidas novelas, ""La Patrona"" de 1847, donde Dostoievski crea una historia en donde el triángulo Ordinov-Murin-Katerina oscila entre el delirio místico y el ardor amoroso y culmina con ese amor trunco con un tercero en discordia como en estos dos casos anteriores.""Noches Blancas"" es uno de los relatos más hermosos que podemos leer de Dostoievski y para ello debemos hacer lo mismo que el narrador: poner en juego el corazón apostando a que seguramente perdamos la partida.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'styl pisania dostojewskiego jest tak wyjatkowy i przesiakniety inteligencja, ze to miod na moje serce. obawiam sie, ze rzucilby mi on najgorsze ochlapy a i tak bylabym zachwycona, to autor tego typu. wspaniala i pelna romantycznych niuansow pozycja. mimo tego, ze watek romantyczny postepowal bardzo szybko,(co bylo wytlumaczalne ze wzgledu na specyficzne usposobienie glownego bohatera) to nie bylo to dla mnie negatywnem. jak ja nie jestem fanka historii milosnych, to kunszt i piekno uzytego jezyka zmiekczyl mi serce. bardzo, bardzo dobra ksiazka.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '«The dreamer—if you want an exact definition—is not a human being, but a creature of an intermediate sort».Fyodor Dostoyevsky.""Ο ονειροπόλος των πεθαμένων ονείρων"".Οι Λευκές Νύχτες στην κυριολεξία εκφράζουν το λυκόφως στις φωτεινές νύχτες της Αγίας Πετρούπολης.Ο ήλιος ποτέ δεν δύει τελείως για να δημιουργηθεί το απόλυτο σκοτάδι.

A lonely soul, a young man, wanders the streets of St. Petersburg musing over a city left emptied as the crowds flee to the countryside for their holidays. He, of course, has not received an invite to escape with the masses. Despite the fact that he makes it a habit to study the faces and emotions of others, not one person really knows or understands him. He is left behind as always. He is a dreamer and finds solace in his fantasies. I imagine the white nights of midsummer, when the sun continues to shine well into the night in the northern latitudes, make one feel even more acutely the pain of being alone, as his or her solitary figure is illuminated even more glaringly by the seemingly everlasting brilliance.One night, however, becomes different from all others as the narrator embarks on an adventure of sorts by saving a solitary young woman from pursuit by a drunken gentleman. A friendship strikes up as the two share their stories with one another. The young man is thankful for the newly discovered companionship and proclaims:""Oh, bless you, bless you a thousand times, my dear, for not having turned away from me at first, for making it possible for me to say that for at least two evenings in my life I have really lived!""The story is quite compelling, and certainly one that is very relatable. Loneliness and unrequited love are indeed universal experiences. What I love about reading Dostoyevsky is how penetrating his observance of human emotion. However, at times I find his writing to be overly sentimental, as is the case here. I don’t like my romance with too much syrup. In fact, I’m more of a light, whipped cream kind of gal, forget the syrup altogether. I think this is a great place to start if one would like to try reading this author, before jumping into one of his rather weighty tomes. It will give you a nice feel for his style, although from what I understand this is one of his earliest works. According to the notes in my copy: “Dostoevsky was to re-write this story in his true manner of creative artist and thinker seventeen years later under the titleNotes from the Underground.” I believe I have a copy of that title as well, so I think it would be interesting to make a comparison of the two pieces.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'نام این کتاب از پدیده ای فیزیکی در نیمکره شمالی زمین وام گرفته شده که باعث پدید آمدن شب هایی نیمه روشن (مانند سپیده فجر) در تابستان می شود.شب های روشن داستان چهارشب زندگی راوی در شهر پترزبورگ است که تمام عمر 26 ساله خود را تا آن زمان به تنهایی گذرانده است.راوی شخصیتی احساسی و خیال پرداز دارد و در عین تنهایی،دوستان زیادی دارد.ساختمان های قدیمی شهر و پیرمردی که تنها با او ارتباط چشمی دارد!و ناگهان در یک شب با دختری گریان روبرو می شودو...تا جایی که اطلاع دارم،دو فیلم با اقتباس از این داستان ساخته شده است.نسخه ایتالیایی با نام شب های سفید(محصول سال 1957،به کارگردانی لوکینو ویسکونتی)و نسخه ایرانی همنام با داستان(محصول سال 1381، به کارگردانی فرزاد موئتمن و نقش آفرینی مهدی احمدی و هانیه توسلی).با خواندن داستان ناخودآگاه داستان را با فیلم موئتمن مقایسه می کردم.کارگردان ایرانی با هنر خاصی به داستان شاخ و برگ افزوده که محتوا و ظرافت فیلم را دو چندان کرده است.در بسیاری موارد،""استاد"" فیلم ایرانی در مقایسه با راوی داستان نسخه اصلی،پخته می نماید.همچنین استاد ادبیات بودن،کتابخانه استاد،نحوه برخورد با کتاب ها،با انسان ها،ساختمان ها و تنهایی اش،باعث جذابیت شخصیت استاد برای مخاطب می شود.به عبارت دیگر شخصیت استاد تا حدودی تحسین برانگیز و قابل تامل است،در حالی که راوی داستان داستایوفسکی شخصیتی ترحم برانگیز است.این تفاوت در هنگام فروش کتابخانه در آن روز پاییزی توسط استاد به اوج می رسد.تحول درونی در استاد بارزتر از راوی داستان اصلی می باشد،استاد در شروع و پایان فیلم شعری از فرخ سیستانی می خواند و تفاوت در صدا و لحن استاد حکایت از تحول عمیق درونی وی دارد'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""There is a sea of emotions raging beneath what seems to beFyodor Dostoyevsky’s uncomplicated storyWhite Nights. It talks about dreams, loneliness, failure, chance love, chivalry, and tears. How can a soul escape from a life of loneliness and unhappiness? At moments of absolute despair, dreaming may seem the only way to survive. I know and can truthfully testify to that because I am a dreamer myself. The unnamed narrator of Dostoyevsky’s love story comes to tell us of his solitude and pain. He begins talking to himself about how is being abandoned in Petersburg by everybody who is leaving for the summer.Whether I walked in the Nevsky, went to the Gardens or sauntered on the embankment, there was not one face of those I had been accustomed to meet at the same time and place all the year. They, of course, do not know me, but I know them. I know them intimately, I have almost made a study of their faces, and am delighted when they are gay, and downcast when they are under a cloud.He has no friends, he is unknown with no connections, and we only hear him when he talks about his city that he seems to know so well.I know the houses too. As I walk along they seem to run forward in the streets to look out at me from every window, and almost to say: “Good-morning! How do you do? I am quite well, thank God, and I am to have a new storey in May,” or, “How are you? I am being redecorated to-morrow;” or, “I was almost burnt down and had such a fright,” and so on.Thus, how else could he escape this life that entangles him within the city but denies him the comfort of human connections? Only dreaming of a life where he would correct everything that is wrong with his life.I am a dreamer; I have so little real life that I look upon such moments as this now, as so rare, that I cannot help going over such moments again in my dreams. I shall be dreaming of you all night, a whole week, a whole year.He dreams of friends and soul mates and all that is possible if only it were all true. Could a chance encounter with a distressed lady bring him forth all his heartfelt desires? Could he live out his dream or must they simply remain only dreams?May your sky be clear, may your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, and may you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another, lonely and grateful heart!My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man's life?What else could Dostoyevsky create for our enigmatic dreamer but a whimsical encounter that will lead him to moments of bliss but nevertheless will throw him again in his solitary life despairing over his unrequited love? He tells us about this dreamer, that represent each of us in our moments of anguish and melancholy. Who has not escape so, running away from what we cannot solve? Perhaps I have the soul of a poet, but I understand our unknown protagonist and fell for him reading Dostoyevsky’s breathtaking beautiful prose. We only have to remember to come back to our mundane life and leave those marvelous moments of fantasy and not brush aside reality altogether as the author’s hero seems to have done. Otherwise, we risk loneliness greater than we faced before wrapping ourselves in a shroud as if it were death itself.I don’t know why I suddenly pictured my room grown old like Matrona. The walls and the floors looked discoloured, everything seemed dingy; the spiders’ webs were thicker than ever.

I think it was fate; I don't usually believe in fate, even though I don't have any proof to disbelieve in it but also no faith to really believe in it, so I'm sort of floating in the middle. However, in this particular moment, I think fate spoke to me. And oh my... Dostoyevsky, what the hell are you doing to me? Yes, addressing to a dead person, here. But this man is always talking to my soul, wherever that thing is. I can always relate to his narrators (they're all so sociable and happy with no problems whatsoever) or some of his other characters. This author described human nature in such a unique way. What a talent to explore the essence of people, from a psychological and philosophical point of view, including the social, political and religious context, of course. He's the whole package.White Nightsis a novella told by an unnamed narrator who goes for a walk every day and knows everybody by sight; he never talked to any of those people. He even imagines conversations with St. Petersburg's buildings. That's how lonely he feels. He's too shy to have any sort of human contact, so he just dreams about it. Until he meets Nastenka, a lonely young girl with a painful story, and they become friends. For the first time, talking-to-buildings guy had someone to spend time with, to talk about anything.Anyway, this novel ends in such a way that shows you what a pure soul this lonely man had. A truly unselfish ending. I even forgot the fact that this man seemed too damn needy. I personally don't like a personthatdesperate for some human contact. You can be desperate, but don't show it that much... don't expose yourself that much, because most of the times, the other person doesn't deserve it. And you let it all out, you share your story and let them see your heart, for nothing. And that might be the cheesiest thing I ever wrote, but it is true.Despite all that, I loved it. If you know what it's like to live in a love-hate relationship with solitude and to have this one single moment of true happiness repeating itself in your mind, night after night, then you will love it too.Dostoyevsky had an exceptionally brilliant way to describe his characters, their inner processes, feelings, thoughts, and if you can relate to any of them, or find them remotely familiar, well my friend, you're stuck with them. You won't forget those people. Ever.Lucky us.*Note: Yeah, I never finishedClockwork Angel... - Apr, 2014** Also onmy blog.""}]"

Questo rende difficile la trasferta, quando si capisce che la loro famiglia non è vista di buon occhio, anzi, da alcuni è proprio odiata, in paese. Le radici dell'odio risalgono a prima della Grande guerra, e si intrecciano al mistero che circonda, da trentacinque anni, il giorno più misterioso ed emblematico della vita di Calcare, quello che lui fin da bambino ricorda come ""Il giorno di Merman"". Negli interstizi dei non detti, l'amore incrollabile di un padre per il suo unico figlio attraversa alcune delle pagine più buie della Storia del nostro Paese, silenziosamente coraggioso. Una storia in cui Zerocalcare si costringe a guardarsi allo specchio e non si fa sconti nel raccontare ciò che vede.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'Tanto bello e caro, però vorrei fare una proposta di legge per tutelare gli italiani da Zerocalcare, perché non è possibile che ogni volta gli venga permesso di spiarci, intrufolarsi nelle nostre teste, leggere i nostri diari segreti, conoscere ogni nostra paura, sogno, rimorso, e tutto il resto.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Bella quest'ultima ora e mezza di daddy issues e sensi di colpaDivertente come sempre, relatable come al solito, confuso e irrisolto come solo i drammi familiari sanno essere (soprattutto le relazioni padri/figli)Ovviamente ognuno ne avrà una visione molto personale e relativa, dubito che *tutta* la storia raccontata sia un'esperienza universale.

È diventato, con il tempo ed espandendosi su altri media [credo che le serie TV abbiano molto influito, a riguardo], un narratore più fine e misurato, capace di intrecciare due piani narrativi totalmente distinti in modo che la tensione di uno traini la fase preparatoria dell\'altro, e che il primo climax, dopo essere esploso, rada al suolo l\'intero scenario per dare più spazio e respiro all\'intimità del secondo. Certo, Zero ha saputo spesso scrivere incastri e rivelazioni riuscite, ma qui tutto è scandito con il metronomo: ha l\'istintività di un regista che, dopo anni di pratica, sa eseguire i suoi movimenti di camera affidandosi solo all\'istinto.Nella famigliarità con il suo stile, il suo modo di fare i ""disegnetti"", emerge anche il timore per la ripetitività e il bisogno di trovare nuove vie. Non mancano i riferimenti culturali della sua adolescenza, né le stilettate alla classe politica attuale, ma sono in numero ridotto rispetto al solito. Allo stesso tempo, mi pare evidente un desiderio di riflessione sul suo modo di disegnare: lo si vede nel doppio che gli restituisce lo specchio in modo esplicito, ma anche in diverse tavole più curate ed elaborate del solito [è probabile che affidarsi ai grigi di Madrigal gli abbia dato tempo e spazio per ""complicarsi""]. Non mi era mai capitato, nelle sue graphic novel precedenti, di fermarmi così spesso per godermi la bellezza dei disegni.E poi, ovviamente, la lingua. Non è tanto la scelta del veneto a essere significativa, quando l\'accantonamento parziale del romano, perché se c\'è una cosa che per Zero è sempre stata identitaria, persino più del suo tratto, questa è la sua voce. Apprezzata o criticata, lo ha sempre reso riconoscibile, anche per quell\'idea, oramai consolidata grazie a tanta TV, che il romano sia verace e schietto, caciarone e famigliare.Se poi, dal punto di vista tematico, ci ha abituati da sempre alla riflessione di sé e su di sé, e quindi anche alla grande consapevolezza sulla propria carriera, inQuando muori resta a menon si tira indietro. È disposto a scoprirsi un altro po\', a tentare di dare voce a ciò che sta sempre in silenzio, la mascolinità, anche per il peso che ha avuto nel renderlo così di successo. Perché nel padre che colpevolizza scherzosamente la sua spilorceria, c\'è il bisogno di giustificarsi, forse persino di chiedere scusa, per il suo aver fatto i soldi senza rompersi la schiena con un lavoro di fatica, da maschio vero [che poi, con tutto quello stare chino, credo abbia più bisogno lui di un chiropratico che tanti altri]. In realtà, però, il successo gli è venuto non dal disegnare - che di disegnatori bravissimi, pure più di lui, ce ne è in quantità -, quanto dal suo essere disposto a esporsi come maschio fragile e fallibile - e questo è un coraggio ben più raro, soprattutto [lo so, mi ripeto], tra i maschi etero cis.Forse è per questo che mi fermo a quattro stelle. Questo libro non è per me, che i miei soldi, negli anni, a Zero li ho dati volentieri proprio perché finalmente ho trovato in lui qualcuno che raccontasse un essere maschi meno asfissiante - certo, complesso e faticoso, una tribolazione inconclusa, ma almeno vivibile. Questo volume è per gli altri, gli uomini che magari sono arrivati al suo modo di scrivere su Netflix e che ne sono rimasti straniti e ora lo stanno cercando altrove. Perché, siamo onesti, questa non è la prima volta in cui Zerocalcare esprime la sua insofferenza per la mascolinità tossica, è solo la più esplicita. Io, da lui, ho bisogno di qualcosa in più, anche se so che è puro egoismo. Ci siamo già trovati qua, abbiamo già parlato di come nostro padre parli una lingua che non capiamo [hai notato anche tu come il modo in cui parla il personaggio di Zerocalcare diventa più freddo e distante e altisonante quando si rapporta con Ping Ping?], abbiamo anche già discusso di quanto è faticoso essere circondati da gente che procrea quando tu non vuoi/non puoi/non te la senti.Zero, io speravo che tu mi dessi qualche soluzione - ma ti voglio bene lo stesso, forse pure di più proprio perché pure tu una soluzione non la trovi.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Come distruggere i lettori con una sola pagina.Quella finale.Bellissimo.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Prima o poi io quest'uomo lo denuncio, perché non è possibile che non solo mi faccia piangere dalle risate e singhiozzare dalla commozione nell'arco di tre vignette, ma si permette persino di sbandierare così ai quattro venti le mie paure e angosce più nascoste, volume dopo volume.

It was all anyone could talk about. And five years later, Pip sees how the tragedy still haunts her town.But she can't shake the feeling that there was more to what happened that day. She knew Sal when she was a child, and he was always so kind to her. How could he possibly have been a killer?Now a senior herself, Pip decides to reexamine the closed case for her final project, at first just to cast doubt on the original investigation. But soon she discovers a trail of dark secrets that might actually prove Sal innocent . . . and the line between past and present begins to blur. Someone in Fairview doesn't want Pip digging around for answers, and now her own life might be in danger.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Yesss! The BBC series adaptation is announced to be released on Netflix on August 1st! It’s a date! Cannot wait!Applause! Applause! Applause! This book offered one of the quickest and most exhilarating roller coaster experiences the moment I laid my hands on it. I’m still shaky, incoherent (I’ve even requested a translator to articulate my thoughts properly), my nails have seen better days, and I’m both confused and dizzy. But I’m also smiling and filled with happiness! I wholeheartedly give it a perfect five out of five mysterious shining stars!The storytelling is exceptional, the plot keeps you hooked, the character development is fantastic, the pacing is fast and heart-pounding, and the ending is immensely satisfying. What are you waiting for, folks? This book won’t just fall from the sky into your lap. Go ahead, buy it, and send me thank-you letters for my encouraging words!We have an incredible heroine in Pippa (don’t mistake her for Pippi Longstocking). Fitz-Amobi is a talented, smart, nerdy, funny, social, friendly, brave investigator who stands somewhere between Nancy Drew and Veronica Mars, a slightly older version of Harriet Walsh, possessing technical skills but without tattoos, leather, or chains, a more restrained version of Lisbeth Salander, and a younger version of Dana Scully without Mulder and alien conspiracies!The blurb is tempting, intriguing, and immediately pulls you in, making it hard to let go of the book, as I found out. My dogs are even jealous of the book, barking at the moon in protest, but I couldn’t put it down, as it’s one of those books that grabs you from the very first page.Five years ago, Andie Bell went missing, and Sal Singh, who committed suicide after confessing to her murder in a text message, was presumed responsible. Yet Andie’s body was never found. The case was closed, but Pippa is determined to reopen it for her school project. She starts by interviewing Sal’s 20-year-old brother, Ravi, who naturally becomes her partner in crime. Their project evolves into a mission to prove Sal’s innocence and find out who might have really killed Andie.As they dig deeper, Pippa’s list of people of interest grows longer, even including her best friend’s sister.There are numerous burning questions in your mind: Who truly killed Andie? Is Andie really dead? Did she deserve her fate? Because as we learn more about her, we discover she was a bully, a drama queen, a drug dealer, and a blackmailer. Her less-than-stellar attributes made me want to give her a piece of my mind. It’s strange because I’ve never felt the urge to confront a presumed dead person—or someone I’m not even sure is deceased! But this character is a living, breathing (or not) scoundrel!Who framed Sal? Did Sal actually do it? His portrayal as a nice, humble, angelic guy led me to nickname him Castiel, like the angel from ‘Supernatural.’ But we can sense he’s been hiding something. His friends changed their testimonies regarding his whereabouts and the time he left their gathering, refusing to be his alibis. So where was he at the time of the murder?Who was sending threatening messages to Pippa, trying to stop her investigation?I devoured this book, and my detective skills failed me completely until the final pages. The author always stayed ten steps ahead of me! I feel blessed to be outsmarted by her brilliant writing. I can already picture this as an amazing YA mystery movie or a limited Netflix series (anything to replace the third season of ‘13 Reasons Why,’ which might as well be titled ‘13 Reasons Why Did You Even Make a Third Season?’).It was an emotional, enjoyable, nail-biting, mind-bending, thrilling, and ultimately satisfying read. I savored every page, every clue, and every heart-pounding moment of this book. I highly recommend it! It’s even better than ‘One of Us Is Lying.’And the best news is there are three more sequels to look forward to! I’ve already started my excitement dance, which is a blend of Beyoncé’s ‘All the Single Ladies’ moves and John Travolta’s ‘Staying Alive’ grooves. Yay!medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""You heard it here first, folks. I have found a newfavorite YA Thriller. I am stoked by how much I loved this!!For her Senior Capstone Project, Pippa Fitz-Amboi, an extraordinarily-focused high school girl, decides to solve a murder.Andie Bell, disappeared five years ago from Pippa's hometown; foul play was suspected.The police, and thus everyone else, believe Andie was murdered by her boyfriend at the time, Sal Singh, who subsequently disposed of the body.Their biggest piece of evidence, a purported confession Sal texted his parents, days after Andie disappeared. This confession was sent just prior to Sal's death, an apparent suicide.In spite of this, Pippa does not believe in Sal's guilt. Andie's body was never recovered and there is no real physical evidence linking him to her disappearance.Pippa is such a great character. She's an overachiever, who works tirelessly towards achieving her goals.You can tell, once she sets her sights on something, she will not give up and that's exactly how she tackles her Senior project.I think one of the things that connected me so much to this story was Pippa. I found her super relatable and loved reading from her perspective.She ends up befriending Sal's younger brother, Ravi. That additional commitment to him, and clearing Sal's name, makes Pippa even more steadfast; in spite of very real danger.Additionally, the format of this was creative and engaging. The use of mixed media sources, including the transcripts for the interviews from Pippa's investigation, and a present day narrative, made me feel like I was a part of the action.As Pippa is evaluating what she has learned along the way, she recaps things, as you actually would if you were working on this type of project; including a running list of current suspects tracked on her murder-board.The stakes were high and there were times Pippa was legitimately in very real danger. Through it all, she stayed true to herself and fought for justice for Andie and Sal.I loved this so much, as I said. I could go on for many more paragraphs of all the positive attributes of this story, but don't just take my word for it, PICK THIS UP!!!If you love it even half as much as I did, you're in for a good time! Well done by Holly Jackson. I am so excited to get more mysteries from her!!!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Who do you think I am, an amateur?""Move aside, Nancy Drew!

Five years later, Pip is a senior in high school, and decides for her final project that she\'s going to find out once and for all what really happened that night.I\'m always in the mood for a good whodunnit. Give me a small group of suspects, everyone hiding secrets, more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and red herrings galore, and I\'m in heaven. I loved putting on my detective cap and puzzling out the clues alongside Pip as she investigates and solves this mystery.For me, in order for a mystery to be successful, it has to be so riveting that there is no room for me to think. Once my mind gets going, it has this annoying habit of supplying me with random unsolicited guesses, some of which inevitably turn out to be right, and ruining the surprises. So it\'s best if I\'m so taken with the story that I\'m only surfacing to turn the pages as fast as I can. And this story was exactly that.I grew up on Nancy Drew, and have been looking for an older version of that for as long as I\'ve outgrown it. And how wonderful that this story turned out to be all that I\'ve been looking for and more. Pip is clever, spunky, and fearless, the perfect teen detective staring down secrets and murderers.

The whole premise was just so unrealistic and unbelievable that I was annoyed from the very first page.The mystery itself was also barely a mystery at all, the pacing was off, things made no sense and everything was terribly convenient. Pip kept making random decisions and suspect basically everyone until she finally guessed the right person. At that point in the book, I was just counting down how many pages I still had to suffer through.Pip had no personality traits aside from her constant need to save everyone because she was such a good person and better than everyone else, which the reader was reminded of every second page. It\'s never explained why any of these people talk to Pip and basically tell her their entire life stories, or even why she cares enough to launch this entire investigation. Her character has no development and at the end of the novel, she\'s still exactly as annoying as she was on the very first page.I wish I hadn\'t read this, it clearly wasn\'t for me and a massive waste of time.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""can i sit at the cool kids table?i enjoyed a popular book. i think i'm well past due my invite at this point.this is a fun book that is sometimes really repetitive and sometimes really boring and only has half of a satisfying ending, and yet it's still a quick read.that is literally all i expect or desire from a popular YA mystery.bottom line: i'm going to read every book in this series until i ruin it for myself <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""This was good but just good.I think I'm getting too old to suspend my disbelief.

I cannot resist a good mystery, and am always on the hunt for the next ""it"" book in the genre. I\'m a busy mom of two, so it is rare for me to find a book so special that I can finish it in two sittings, but that\'s exactly what I found withA Good Girl\'s Guide to Murder.Pippa Fitz-Amobi is a true crime loving teen who aspires to become a top-notch journalist one day. So naturally, she decides to focus her senior capstone project on her small town\'s most buzz-worthy, unsolved crime: the murder of Andie Bell. What begins as a simple proposal quickly turns into an in-depth investigation full of unexpected twists and turns. After teaming up with the alleged murderer\'s brother, the pair spiral into a web of danger and obsession, and quickly wonder if they\'ve gotten themselves in too deep.This debut reads as if you are investigating alongside the main characters, and fans of true crime podcasts will rejoice in the multimedia formatting that so wittily engages the reader from beginning to end. If you enjoy a grounded, engaging mystery that features a diverse cast, discussions surrounding racial injustice, and the importance of found family, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.

Here me out I got my reasons 🫣So I had a lot of fun reading it, the mystery surrounding Angie and Sal was really awesome. Pip and Ravi are likable characters and with intriguing personalities. The amount of work Pip put in to unravel the mystery was commendable and it's all for a school project 😅It's awell written and extremely well thought out book,no doubt, so kudos to the author there. Also the way she exposed racism via characters like Stanley is something I really liked. Let's be honest, people like him still exist. That was the only part in the book where the author was realistic...Cmon you expect me to believe a school girl solved this murder case when the big guys police, detectives can't do shit. I get there can be some sort of corruption involved in cases but no way a school kid is solving a murder that complicated without the consistent assistance of someone with experience. I don't care how intelligent Pip was, it's justextremely unrealistic.Also, it was kind of a bummer that Ravi didn't get that much of time in the book. I wanted to see him involved more often.Don't even get me started on the dog. Thelast 100 pages were really wild.So much happened, so many exposed and new questions arising. Am keen on starting with the next book already.It's definitely worth checking out but it's not anything special. Maybe the expectations got to me but I would suggest to anyone who reads this for the first time- go in with lowered expectations. I personally believe thatFive Survivewas the better book.~•~•~Y'all.. Am gonna do it🤞 Really hope it's worth the hype""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Well, it appears, I've been reading YA mysteries all wrong these past years. Evidently, I should not expect plausibility, believability, character development or strong motivations in these books, like I do when reading adult mysteries. No wonder there is only ONE teen mystery that I think is good, and actual teens don't even like reading it, from what I hear. (It'sSadiein case you were wondering).A Good Girl's Guide to Murderstarts off as a Serial rip-off, with upstanding Pippa swooping in Sarah Koenig-like to clear the name of a poor brown guy accused of the murder of a popular girl whose body remains missing. You see, it's only Pippa who believes in Sal's innocence, and she will save the day, because she is a GOOD GIRL and Sal was once nice to her years ago! I was already annoyed at that point.However, from there this story devolves into a sleuthing adventure where Pippa manages to have every Tom, Dick and Harry confess all their misdoings to her, because PIPPA IS WRITING A SCHOOL PAPER ABOUT THE MURDER. She catphishes people, breaks into houses, blackmails drug dealers, discovers 5-year old evidence in plain view, because she is just so much better than the police at everything. I can understand why police wouldn't care to pursue a case of aWho Drew The D!cks or The Turd Bulrglarvariety, but a suicide and a presumed murder? And the victim is still missing and nobody but Pippa cares? Have you heard of Natalie Halloway? She disappeared 15 years ago, and she is still on TV. The whole investigation was one giant eyeroll for me.Anyway, to put it short, this book has nothing that I look for in a mystery. I am not reading any more YA mysteries if suspending disbelief entirely is the main requirement to get through them. I am just going to stick with Courtney Summers from now on. Thankfully she has another one coming out next year, and it's about cults!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""The dad wouldn’t allow boys in the bedroom but was fully OK with Pip going on unsupervised co-ed sleepovers…….The best audiobook of the year!

Those lies were allowed.”I LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH 🫶I had the sudden urge to reread this series after reading a different murder mystery book and realizing that I am so good at reading those types of books quickly, so I was hoping and praying that they would get me out of my terrible reading slump, and since I just reread this entire series, I\'m really hoping it worked 😭🤞This is also such a good series to reread if you first read it a long time ago, because going into this I remembered nothing except for the basics and who the murderer was, but it was almost like reading it for the first time all over again which is such a good experience.∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The PlotAll of Holly Jackson\'s books have wild plots 😭 even in this reread I was gasping and feeling so confused and then almost crying.Murder mysteries always have a way of making me super stressed or tense or nervous but this trilogy is something else when it comes to that, there\'s just this certain undertone to them that make me so wrapped into the story-line that I forget about the real world and literally everything spooks me 😭I love that this book isn\'t super predictable. During my first read I was so confused, but I had so many guesses as to who the murderer was, or who any other suspects for any of the other small plot-lines were, but I never guessed who it was, which is always a good feeling. Though I get a good feeling when I get it right too, so either way, it\'d have been great 🤪Still never getting past acertainevent in this book.Thatscene has always stuck with me 😒“Pip wished she was strong enough, but she’d learned that she wasn’t invincible; she too could break.”∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The CharactersI know that we only really begin to see it in this book but Pip is an actual like psychotic genius or something. She is so smart and such a good detective, and she can solve mysteries in the amount of time that it would take for me to even start collecting the clues. Excluding that, she is also just such a relatable character, like if you disregard the fact that she solves murders and stuff then she\'s just a normal, relatable teenage girl! 🤷\u200d♀🤷\u200d♀ way better than me though, I wish I was more like Pip (only in this one though) she\'s also like crazy brave, I would not be able to do ANY of the things she did.Ravi is my KING. I\'ve always loved him, he\'s just so adorable and friendly and EVERYTHING. He\'s so loyal and seeing him try so hard to prove his brother\'s innocence is just so amazing, just showcasing his determination and passion. I also ADORE the fact that he\'s not afraid to show his emotions; like I\'ve read a lot of books about stone-cold guys who don\'t show emotions, like their grumpy and blah blah blah but Ravi is definitely not the grumpy one, I\'d say Pip is more of the grumpy one if that\'s the case, but Ravi tries hard to be sunshine and rainbows and I love it 👑🫅FUCK MAX HASTINGSI love Pip\'s friends (except for two people), they\'re just so fun and have a wide range of personalities 😃Yeah I didn\'t really care for them much, except I did really love Cara.“They were each other’s crutch to lean on when life got too much to carry alone.”∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘The RelationshipsNow, there wasn\'t really much of a romance but it\'s kindaquiteobvious where one ""friendship"" is headed, so you\'ve been warned if you don\'t wanna see.I loved Pip\'s relationship with her family, it felt real and authentic, and they were all so cute, as well as her friendships, they were all just so loyal.All of those are insignificant in comparison to Team Pip and Ravi, my dream team. They mesh so well together that it\'s actually insane. They are the ONLY romance I have ever accepted in murder mysteries, which is saying a lot because I actually despise despise despise romances in murder mysteries, so these two are waaay up on a pedestal that even I can\'t reach right now.Also, the nickname Sarge is the cutest thing ever.“We’re a team, remember. You and me.”AH∘◦ ✂ ————–✂ ◦∘Overall, this was probably the last time I can ever read this book ""for the first time"" because I usually remember everything after the second read, which is unfortunate, but whateverI LOVE THIS SERIES SO MUCH5 stars(note: and if this stupid show isn\'t available in the US I\'m gonna scream my head off.)“Maybe laughter was one of the very first things you lost after something like that.”<><><><><><><>rereadeither Pip is some sort of genius or the cops in that town are actual idiots. i think it\'s bothanyways i\'m on a roll, two books in one week is great for someone who hasn\'t read since december AND i read this in 2 daysrtc 😜<><><><><><><>Y\'ALL I HEARD THEY\'RE MAKING A SHOW OUT OF THIS, THIS BETTER NOT BE A JOKE AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I NEED PIP AND RAVI HELP<><><><><><><>Holy cow, I did not expect that ending.

And it\'s also one of the first I\'ve read entirely in English, and as you know that Spanish is my native language, I assume you\'ll know that it was a bit complex. Although, I\'m adapting a bit more to reading in English. Wish me luck, folks.In A Good Girl\'s Guide to Murder we follow Pippa Fitz-Amobi, a 17-year-old student whose final year project is the case of Andie Bell, who was murdered by her boyfriend, Sal Singh and taken for granted by the police. But Pippa knows Sal is innocent, so she decides to find out what happened five years ago and whoreally killedAndie Bell.Pippa discovers that Andie had many secrets, that she was not the beautiful and tragic victim that the people of Little Kilton martyred and idolised, branding Sal Singh a murderer and a monster, treating his family very badly for it. In addition, Little Kilton holds even more secrets that intrigue Pip and make her want to keep digging to solve the mystery.Writing.I don\'t think I remember reading a book like this, with diary-like entries speaking in first person and then in third person. It was a bit strange, if I\'m honest, and it took me a bit longer to adjust. However, it was an easy read in some respects. And, I don\'t know if it\'s because of the difference between British and American English, but there were phrases that I had to look up because I didn\'t understand them, lmao.Plot.The plot kept me glued in my seat, not wanting to put my phone down, wanting to know what would happen next. I mention that I was late with this book because college is eating me alive, though I made time to keep reading because I was consumed with thoughts of not knowing what would happen, who the killer would be and if Pip was going to find out. There are a lot of plot twists that I wasn\'t expecting and a lot of things that made my brain almost melt from thinking about it so much.Pacing.It was a quick and light read, and I take back that I was late because of college: I would have finished it sooner if it weren\'t for homework. It\'s not that complicated to understand and the pages turn very quickly.Characters.Pip is a good girl, addicted to homework and determined to solve the Andie Bell case and prove that Sal Singh is innocent at all costs. So eager is she to find out what really happened, that she finds herself lying to others so that they won\'t worry about her and try to stop her from abandoning her project.Ravi is the younger brother of Sal Singh. He has been the target of criticism, and is known as the brother of Andie Bell\'s killer. Ravi knows his brother is innocent, and when Pip shows up at his door asking him a few questions, he thinks it\'s a joke. And soon, Ravi becomes Pip\'s partner in crime, both looking for answers about his brother\'s sudden death and his innocence in the case. Ravi is a beautiful little baby, don\'t touch him I want to take care of him.Also, Ravi: marry me.Andie was a bitch and it doesn\'t surprise me much that bad things happened to her. Everyone held her in such high regard, believing she was a good girl whose boyfriend murdered her. Andie ruined several people\'s lives, and although I thought I would feel bad that she had died, I didn\'t really. When you find out the truth about Andie Bell, what she did and didn\'t do, you don\'t feel any empathy for her.Cara is Pip\'s best friend, her older sister is Naomi, who was in turn Sal\'s best friend and who also keeps a big secret that makes Pip dig very closely into her and her life, including her family.(Bonus and unnecessary fact:Cara translates from Spanish to English as: \'face\' and \'expensive\'.Unnecessary examples:Sucaraes hermosa= her face is beautiful. La camisa escara= the shirt is expensive.) Follow me for more unnecessary Spanish classes, they are free of charge.Pip\'s family is ok. They\'re the typical caring and normal family. Tho I loved Vic\'s jokes, jsjsjs he laughing at his own jokes (just as Ravi) is totally me.Max Hastings can die and I wouldn\'t care for him. He deserves the shit going on in his life. He\'s a dick and you can easily see it. Please, go fuck yourself, you fucking bastard. 🥰🥰🥰⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️oK, PEOPLE, SPOILER SECTION. YOU\'VE BEEN WARNED.⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️Tho I loved this book, I really enjoyed and liked it a lot, there were many ??? things that left me with a bitter taste on my mouth.First of all, Pip felt a little bit dry and typical. She\'s a good girl who starts to lie for her project and she doesn\'t feel the same anymore. I mean, idk, I can\'t put it into words, I just hope she felt morerealand not flat.Second, how quick all of the possible suspects told Pip the truth, when they lied to the police or omitted information. I found it quite unbelievable and a little bit ilogic. Also, Mr. Ward confessed really quick and it felt dry... I don\'t quite know how to explain it, but I was expecting more. Becca Bell also confessed really quick, and spilled her secrets out as she were talking about the weather, which also felt a little bit bitter.aND THE FINAL STRAW: BARNEY. NO. NO. NO.

Ustedes saben que llevo tiempo interesada en leer thrillers y este me lo habían recomendado un montón, luego vi las reseñas y terminé por convencerme, ¡no me arrepiento!Pippa, la protagonista, es un ser fácil de querer, jajaja. Sí siento que a veces era demasiado impulsiva y no medía las consecuencias de sus actos, pero aún así solo quería que todo le saliera bien. No sé, como protagonista me pareció dinámica y divertida y carismática, en ningún momento me cansé de seguirla en su investigación :). DIGO, sí llegué a pensar que estaba llevando las cosas muy lejos, pero se me hizo un personaje tan bien construido, que sus acciones tenían sentido (tipo de: ""¡eso es tan Pippa!"").AWWW, además no me esperaba al interés amoroso y, aunque la historia no se centra para nada en el romance, se me hizo una parejita súper bonita AND I WAS ROOTING FOR THEM.El elemento principal de la historia es el misterio y está súper bien llevado. El libro te atrapa desde el primer momento y es imposible de soltar. Además, a mí me pareció poco predecible. Teníamos a varios sospechosos y TODOS PODÍAN SER CULPABLES. Todos tenían sus razones muy fuertes. ¿Y adivinen qué? Obviamente no le atiné, jajajaja.Eso sí, no sé si continuar con la trilogía porque creo que este libro terminó muy bien así.

No es que hubiera leído muchas reseñas positivas ni nada por el estilo, perome daba esa sensación misteriosa que algunos libros te dan y sabes que necesitas leerlo y que te va a gustar.Sabéis a lo que me refiero, ¿no?EnAsesinato para principiantestenemos una trama que sinceramente me ha sorprendido muy positivamente.Losthrillersjuveniles de este estilo, a lo Natasha Preston o incluso Sara Shepard, suelen quedarse a veces un poco en la superficie de todo. Bueno, quizá no es la superficie, pero sí queme suele faltar un poco que me construyan mejor todo. Y es que Holly Jackson no escatima en detalles.A ver,el libro te agarra desde el primer momento.Yo normalmente leo el primer capítulo de un libro para decidir si va a ser mi próxima lectura o no, y en este caso es que llevaba página y media y dije pOR DIOS, SÍ, ESTO TIENE QUE SER MÍO.El estilo de la autora hace que te introduzcas de lleno en la historia, y lo mejor de todo, es que no es solo unthriller.Para que un libro de estas características funcione, o por lo menos para mí es esencial, tiene que tener una buena protagonista con la que conecte, entienda y quiera luchar por ella. Pip es así.La construcción del personaje no es algo accesorio, al contrario. Holly Jackson se centra bastante en tener una protagonista muy definida, conociendo detalles de su vida privada, relaciones con amigos y demás.No hace que el ritmo del libro bajey no hace tampoco que te impacientes para descubrir qué está pasando en el pueblo. La manera en la que Jackson maneja el espacio entre escenas me ha gustado mucho.No es muy normal para mí ponerle 5 estrellas a un libro de este género. No sé por qué, la verdad, peropuedo recordar pocas ocasiones donde unthrillerme haya volado la cabeza tantísimo.Pero es que enAsesinato para principiantestenemosuna historia que está perfectamente hilada, que se desarrolla lentamente pero con decenas de giros, y que te atrapa cada vez más porque se va convirtiendo en una locura cada vez más increíble.De hecho, le han visto el increíble potencial que tiene y los derechos audiovisuales han sido comprados. Esperemos que la cosa fluya y tengamos a Pippa y Ravi en la gran (o pequeña) pantalla, porque de verdad,este libro es increíble.Tenemos toda la trama de misterio, sobre qué pasó con Addie Bell y Sal Singh, cuyas averiguaciones van poniéndote los pelos de punta cada vez más.Los métodos para descubrir mentiras o verdades a medias de Pip son de aplaudir, porque es una chica muy inteligente y que no le tiene miedo a nada: tan solo persigue la verdad y la justicia.Una de mis cosas favoritas del libro es lowokeque es la autora.Pippa tiene un padrastro -al que llama padre- de origen nigeriano, su nuevo mejor amigo es indio y una de sus amigas es lesbiana. Y dirás: “¡pero la protagonista sigue siendo blanca! ¡Es una privilegiada!” Y así es. Y, de hecho, es tan así que hasta ella misma lo dice.Hay situaciones de racismo en el libro en las que Pippa habla sobre tener privilegios por ser blanca, sobre cómo puede tener actitudes racistas pese a haberse criado con un padre negro…Me ha encantado que en un libro de misterio aparentemente solo de eso, se debatan o comenten este tipo de temas sociales.También se habla de machismo, abusos sexuales…En general, es un libro con temas de actualidad, y quizá la excusa para tratarlos es el misterio. (Aunque tampoco es que la crítica sea una pieza central, no nos confundamos.)Sin embargo,con lo que más me quedo deAsesinato para principianteses con la pedazo de trama de Holly Jackson y cómo está organizada. Os prometo que es increíble la cantidad de capas que tiene la historia, la cantidad de personajes relacionados… Es que sigo sin palabras.Qué maravilla.Ahora solo queda esperar a ver si traen el segundo pronto a España, porque si no…Amazon, is that you?(También os digo, que me da mucha rabia hacer la reseña sin spoilers. Se me queda corta comparada con todo lo que quiero hablar, pero no quiero joderos la experiencia.

But Pippa Fitz-Amobi thinks that Sal is not the killer. She chooses this case as the topic for her final year, Senior Capstone Project. She is trying to find the mystery behind Andie Bell\'s case. Was Sal the real killer? If not, is Pippa\'s life in danger? Will the killer try to hurt Pippa so that she won\'t be able to solve the case? Holly Jackson will answer all these questions through this book.What I learned from this book1) What is hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia?This is an interesting new word I learned from this book. Its meaning is fear of long words.“Pip knew a great many things; she knew thathippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobiawas the technical term for the fear of long words.”2) What happens to all the missing people?The author shares some interesting statistics related to the missing people in this book. This will help us to know what actually happens to the missing people.“I found these statistics: 80% of missing people are found in the first twenty-four hours. 97% are found in the first week, and 99% of cases are resolved in the first year. That leaves just 1%. 1% of people who disappear are never found. And just 0.25% of all missing persons cases have a fatal outcome.""3) What is toxic productivity, and how can it hurt our life?Few of my friends and patients are obsessed with watching productivity videos on YouTube. Productivity is always good in our life. But when it reaches such a level that we always try to be productive in all areas of life, it might reach toxic levels. Are the online productivity gurus hurting people\'s lives instead of helping them? This serious question can only be answered after more profound research and understanding.The author indirectly mentions toxic productivity in a couple of areas in this book.“What\'s wrong with me? ... I might seem like the ideal student: homework always in early, every extra credit and extracurricular I can get my hands on, the good girl and the high achiever. But I realized something just now: it\'s not ambition, not entirely. It\'s fear. Because I don\'t know who I am when I\'m not working, when I\'m not focused on or totally consumed by a task. Who am I between the projects and the assignments, when there\'s nothing to do? I haven\'t found her yet and it scares me.""“Your efficiency offends me.”My favourite three lines from this book“Half less of a bad thing meant there was room for half good.”“The people you love weren’t algebra: to be calculated, subtracted, or held at arm’s length across a decimal point.”""But sometimes remembering isn\'t for yourself, sometimes you do it just to make someone else smile. Those lies were allowed.""What could have been better?If you are someone who attended Med School, you will know how some patients try to avoid Med School students saying that they are not Doctors even after knowing they will be Doctors in a couple of years.If we look at the world from the angle of the people I mentioned above, it will be difficult to believe that a teenager is going for an important murder investigation like this, and almost every person connected to it treating her like a real grown-up police officer/ detective and fully cooperating with her and telling her everything they know. It, in fact, looks totally unrealistic from any practical human being\'s point of view.Rating3.5/5This is a real page-turner with many twists that will satisfy most of the readers.—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""3.5/5 ✧･ﾟi have finally finished this and i'm not sure entirely how i feel - i think i'm going to give it 3.5 stars for now? i definitely enjoyed it, but the ending was a little... i don't know maybe i wasn't following as closely as i should of? 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶╰┈➤Plot:This was overall enjoyable, it was YA so I didn't feel a gripe in my stomach (but I did in Five Survive). The stakes didn't feel that high - this is for sure more murder mystery than thriller. It was very addicting though and did not see the first big plot twist coming at all. A lot of the points Pip (the main character) though 'oh that's suspicious!' - I think a normal person wouldn't have thought that and all. I get that's the point of her character, she 'overthinks', finds leads and chases them down like a bloodhound. To me, whilst this book discusses some really important topics, I didn't find it thrilling.I also didn't guess who did it, but I was hoping Sal would have a bigger part to play, considering how him and Andie's relationship is pictured?.I know I've just trashed on the plot so you might be wondering why it's still such a high rating -╰┈➤Characters:All the characters were loveable.Pipis your typical quirky and super intelligent female YA MC. She grows on you, especially her relationship with her family. She started to annoy me in some parts - and she seemed tohave a bit of plot armour.Raviis so incredibly sweet and funny I could picture the flirting in my head.We didn't see too much of any other characters, but it all felt like typical high school to me.╰┈➤World/Setting:This... was OK. I could kind of picture the different places she was talking about, the places of interest - it wasn't particularly like amazing or adding a sense of dread. Compared to Five Survive, the world didn't feel as vivid. It does the job though.╰┈➤Pacing:This is where the book really shines. Holly Jackson is so good at creating addicting page turners. I couldn't put it down, even if some points frustrated me at times and I cringed at others.╰┈➤Enjoyment:I'm not the target audience for this book, so I didn't expect to give it 5 stars here. However, I did enjoy this book a lot. To me it felt like a fun detective story, I wasn't trying to solve anything because too much information was being thrown my way.

Those born Ordinary are just that—ordinary. And when the king decreed that all Ordinaries be banished in order to preserve his Elite society, lacking an ability suddenly became a crime—making Paedyn Gray a felon by fate and a thief by necessity.Surviving in the slums as an Ordinary is no simple task, and Paedyn knows this better than most. Having been trained by her father to be overly observant since she was a child, Paedyn poses as a Psychic in the crowded city, blending in with the Elites as best she can in order to stay alive and out of trouble. Easier said than done.When Paeydn unsuspectingly saves one of Ilyas princes, she finds herself thrown into the Purging Trials. The brutal competition exists to showcase the Elites’ powers—the very thing Paedyn lacks. If the Trials and the opponents within them don’t kill her, the prince she’s fighting feelings for certainly will if he discovers what she is—completely Ordinary.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""an editor! an editor! my kingdom for a f*cking editor!(no kingdoms were harmed in the making of this review)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩i am what some sexist pigs would call a basic bitch. if you give me a tall, dark-haired, sarcastic, morally-grey guy in a romantasy that combines some of my favourite books and tropes -whilst still keeping some sense of originality, i'll be content.this book had all of that. (well, the tall-dark-haired-mmc-in-a-romantasy part)excluding the originality. (and the morally-grey part but i’ll get to that)lauren said powerless was“if the child of the hunger games and red queen didn't look anything like its parents.”…see, if that were true, then this review wouldn’t exist.(and i know i’m the myopic bitch of the prime meridian, but this was exactly like it’s parents, as well shatter me and the selection)in fact, i was so angry about it, that i made a whole list. and then other people helped me add more to the list, and then, i realised that this wasn’t really an unpopular opinion at all.but before i get into all the ways this book was unoriginal, i’m going to criticise everything else. and if you don’t want to read about that,then scroll away.do not throw a tantrum in the comment section because someone expressed their criticisms about a book that you enjoyed. it’s incredibly immature, and quite franklyhilariousstupid because you’re wasting your time writing a comment that i’m just going to deleteafter screenshotting it and sending it on the group chat.anyway, let’s talk about something that actually wasn’t criticised that much: the writing.for a debut novel, it wasn’t that bad. for a book hyped up to the point where it could be mistaken as the greatest literary masterpiece this generation could ever bear witness to, it was trash.it read like an unedited draft that was both half-finished and yet too long at the same time, with the typos only making it worse. every sentence was so long-winded with synonyms upon synonyms being thrown into one sentence so whilst it might sound like this deeply thought-out didactic monologue about how inflation has affected the economy to the point that shakespeare's sonnets are no longer analysed correctly, it’s really just a horny teenage boy trying to sound edgy.and serious question: have recent authors heard of show not tell? i am not an idiot incapable of coming to my own conclusions, thank you very much. i don’t need to be told about just how morally questionable princekrabskai is, when i should just be able toinferfrom what the authorimplies. except the author didn't imply anything, for fuck's sake this dude barely killed anyone.on top of that, the sheer amount of times i read “blue eyes”, “smoky eyes”, “ocean eyes” was enough to put me off reading forever. billie eilish is crying through her “aquamarine orbs” right now. and the amount of times these characters were huffing and puffing - for the love of all that is holy, use!!an!!inhaler!! someone’s lips were always twitching into a smile, or someone was snorting/ chuckling/ blinking/ eyeing something or someone, or paedyn was being called “vicious little thing” by kai - which only succeeded in me receiving fourth wing flashbacks. kai was always flicking paedyn’s nose for no given reason, and one or the other was constantly in a “throng of people”. plus, the inner monologues were also the most repetitive things i have ever read which really helped make the book incredibly long and boring, with the pacing losing to a snail in a 500m run. it’s filled with so much banter and such eye-rolling dialogue that after a certain point, you begin to wonder how on earth the mcs would cope without hearing themselves speak, as well as so many trope-centred and pointless scenes.if you don’t believe me yet, screw you and read this list of tropes:knife/dagger/arrow to the throat (every other page), enemies to lovers (not on a single page), insta lust, slow burn, who did this to you, she's so smol, forbidden romance, cleaning each other’s wounds, comforting after a nightmare, the most unnecessary love triangle (only one love interest has a pov), some stupid trials that have no history and don’t even make sense, and the street thief trope (cue the eyeroll - i’m probably an outlier on this one, but i just hate how much the street thief trope has been overused. there was no way paedyn would have survived a day on the streets with the amount of stupid shit that she pulled. did no one notice her wonderfully-amazing-most-gorgeous-beautiful-stunning-oh-so-rare-never-seen-before hair colour while she was off pickpocketing the rich? i’m very sure no one did, seeing as it wasn’t mentioned on every.other.page.)now it's time for more stupid things.. so many stupid things. so many. and i’ve actually missed a lot so if you can remember anything i’m missing please let me know <3➳ a trained soldier is dancing in the middle of a deathly arena because he likes a girl - mhm wow what a great idea, it's totally not going to get your dumb ass killed. aaand now they’re playing thumb war. sorry are we sure this dude is the future enforcer?➳“what i should have done was laugh in his face before making him go down the staircase first, but i’ve thrown caution to the wind and hastily replaced it with curiosity.”yeahhh great idea, go down a dark, damp, dank, dirty, dusty, secret stairway with a guy you're not even sure you should trust. greaaat idea!!➳“it’s really quite simple,” calum says. “the majority of us will finally all gather together, and we’ll show the people of ilya who we are and what we have to say. show them that we are not a threat while also reminding them of who they have been killing for decades. the king is going to have to either admit his lies about the ordinaries or simply give us our freedom. and you are going to help us do it.”ahhh yess so simple - it totally won't lead to a bunch of deaths, lies, revelations,andanother book.➳“i can practically hear sadie blink behind me. she’s clearly stunned by his lack of concern, especially after seeing the two of us dancing together only minutes ago. i would be stunned myself if i wasn’t so used to seeing his masks—if i didn’t recognize the cold one he’s just slipped on.”every.romantasy.ever becauseGOD FORBID A MAN SHOW HIS FEELINGS➳“yes, we are opponents. yes, i am the future enforcer. yes, I’m a killer that has no right to want to keep her. but there is something else, something that has her refusing to admit this confusing connection we share.”wannabe mafia lord who?➳“something begins burning inside of me, but I ignore it, not bothering to acknowledge the jealousy painting me Ilya’s kingdom color.”i- ..no comment➳ oh, but little miss paedyn gray over here was no better. every part about her needed a special mention (or two). even her ass!“as soon as my ass got numb from sitting on that bloody stump, i stood and paced circles around our camp before splashing cold water from the creek on my face and body. then my ass got cold, and i moved next to the fire to lie down on the hard ground i’m so familiar with.”narcissism who?? this was my daily reminder as to why fictional ya books don’t include the part where they have to deal with bodily functions out in the wild.➳ and in regards to the trials aspect,it had no real point.our only explanation was that the elites were being killed off in an arena to display their oh-so-original powers despite us constantly being that the elites' lives were more valuable. what the fuck?? someone introduce this author to world-building immediately. it would have been much more understandable if it were all the ordinaries to battle to the death, (despite this already drawing a lot from the hunger games) and then you get your one oh-so-precious girl who goes through a makeover, has two guys lusting after her yada yada yada [insert all your favourite 2010 dystopian references here]. i honestly wouldn’t have even minded it, and i would have eaten it up immediately.➳ if anyone is interested in more of my points, i wrote a very long paragraph in message 192 on page 4 of the comments section below. it's also one of the many pages where you can find me breaking my promise to myself to not respond to idiots on the internetmoving on, let’s go back to paedyn seeing as my love for her runs so deep!she’s katniss’s not-like-other-girls cousin who decides to insult the fuck out of you the minute you’re stood in a 2-mile radius to any guy. i wanted to claw her eyes out when she began with her “play the part shit” - which i’m pretty sure was ripping off the selection, which starred our just as talented, just as flawless america singer!, who by the way is a singer. from the dollar tree.ANYWAY, according to this very unbiased book, miss paypal over here had exactly 0 flaws. her only weakness was her infinite love for others, which was clearly evidenced when her seamstress friend is introduced yet barely ever mentioned. when our “darling” pae finally realises that she forgot about her after she was whisked away to the palace to become a princess overnight, she has the audacity to ignore her the entire time because she's too busy fawning over prince kahoot. *sigh* don’t you just love our 2012 wattpad heroine!now for prince krabs! yay! honestly he was the funniest character in the bookby far. his lines weren’t just cheesy and cringey, they were downright stupid too! he really is the whole package *swoons*he was bland as fuck omg. and annoying. very annoying. the only thing he ever managed to kill was my sanity. he’s also managed to ruin the word “darling” for me forever, which is yk, great. morally-grey my ass, he's a walmart kaz (insulting to kaz but still). he has no true redeeming qualities, and for that reason i quite frankly believe that him and pea-brain really deserve each other!(iwasgoing to do a section on the side-characters, but considering the amount of brain cells i have already lost just by recounting the so-called “personalities” of the two love-birds above, i don’t think that will be the best thing to do right now. however, when i figure out how to regenerate my axons and dendrites, i will be back.)˚✩ ⋆｡˚ ✩after this rather long paragraph ends, there will be tons of spoilers for the selection series (which i don’t recommend reading), the red queen (didn’t love it, didn’t hate it, just indifferent), the hunger games (if you haven’t read this yet, then what the hell are you doing with your life?), and a few mentions of the shatter me series (which is regarded by some as the greatest piece of literature and by others - me - as the greatest piece of dog sh*t that was dropped into this world), the darkest mind series (i’ve never read it), and the jasad heir (i enjoyed it). if you don’t want to be spoiled (although not all the similarities are spoilers, i just couldn't be asked to mark the ones that are) then you can skip to the bottom of this review where you will see a funny gif i found that pretty much sums up my personal experience with powerless.update:there is now a bonus section at the end (before the funny gif) with books that are similar/give the same vibes as powerless. note: i have not read all of these so please don't kill me if i'm wrong about any. if you have any info you want me to add then leave me a comment/dmyes, i realise that i have missed out on so many herethe selection:➳illéailya➳ a girl from the slums and from an undesirable position in society that rose up in the ranks➳ our fmc has different colour dress to everyone else➳ all the scenes where they're eating food➳ the queen likes the dancing in the balls➳ the balls➳ the safe room stuff that i’m not asked to go into detail about➳ the girl on girl hate -

i was rooting for her so hard. it was refreshing to see a fmc that didn’t have magic or special powers and had to rely on her wits to stay alive. she was an incredibly written character — the overlooked girl who constantly had to fight for what she has. her strength, wit, determination and preservation was just so admirable. getting to see her development and overcome so many obstacles was so lovely to read about. she is one of the best fmcs i have read about in a while!! she is the embodiment of “don’t underestimate the underdog.” watching her prove everyone wrong was so fun to read about, she always found a way to conquer a situation and be powerful in her own way. but girly was way stronger than me. constantly pulling away from someone you want is baffling to me, especially since it’s kai like girl that man is obsessed with you!!➳kai:the prince of Ilya and the king’s future enforcer hunts those like paedyn and kills them, yet pae somehow convinces him she’s a mundane, an elite who has a lesser power. kai has the ability to sense and use other elites powers and though he can’t sense pae’s “psychic” ability he goes along with it. from there we get to witness their palpable chemistry and snarky banter. aaa he is everything n more, i can’t get over him. this man just has a way with words. the way i was giggling like a little girl, blushing, twirling my hair and kicking my feet every time he spoke. kai was a complex character, and his struggle for redemption was interesting to read about despite who he had become. but he was just so sweet, charming, tortured, swoony, witty and perfect. when he braided her hair and called her “my pretty pae” I COMPLETELY LOST IT. I NEED HIM BIBLICALLY. the way he was so down bad for pae?? he was smitten with her from the very beginning — for him, she is the only girl in the room. the fact that he knew her capabilities and gave ‘that’s my girl’ vibes rather than forcing her into protection and hiding her away from the world. seriously, how can you not love him!!— what was the authors fascination with the characters fkn eye colour. like seriously take a shot every time you read “ocean eyes” and “grey eyes” (spoiler you will probably die from alcohol poisoning) like pls stfu about his grey eyes and her ocean eyes, i got it the first 10 times you said it and also pae constantly going on about kitt’s green eyes omg pls free me, enough is enough!! 😭➷ the slow burn is absolutely top tier, it worked so perfectly for the setting and the plot. how the author built up this fiery and heated chemistry between the mcs despite them not even sharing a single kiss was just so immaculate 😮\u200d💨 the banter and the tension was incredible, i just love the combination of a “who did this to you” boy meets “i will stab you” / “why do you care” girl. the banter and tension was good but their sweet and vulnerable moments together were even better. seriously the romance is just incredible, the way both characters navigate their own storyline but are so heavily intertwined at the same time, it was all consuming in the best possible way. the tension, knife to throat scenes, the longing stares, the lingering touches, the dance scenes, the yearning, the banter & flirty conversations is etched into my memory!!”mark my words, prince, i will be your undoing.” i lean in, ignoring the knife against my throat as i murmur, “oh, darling, i look forward to it.”— this book is marketed as “enemies to lovers” but it’s definitely more of an instant attraction as they were both captivated with one another from the very beginning. kitt (kai’s brother) and pae would be a true enemies to lovers since she didn’t like him bc of who he constantly reminded her of.— the world-building wasn’t the best and very much lacking as there wasn’t much description and depth and there was many repetitive phrases throughout this book but as this was a debut novel i’m not going to make any judgements on that as i didn’t mind and i didn’t expect this book to be perfect.this book was very fast paced which i appreciated since a lot of fantasy books tend to be slow at times. the world is easy to understand so this book is great for those who are new to fantasy books. the beginning was rocky for me but once i was into it i was really into it - you do get easily engaged and immersed, mainly because the romance is worth it. i felt so much devastation as i was reading the last few chapters. there was so much action, so much emotion and so many reveals. the author done an amazing job setting up book two because there is still so much left unsaid — I SERIOUSLY NEED THAT BOOK RN!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4 stars\'Who did this to you\'BOY\'why do you care\'GIRL.This book is literally a romcom with action scenes in it! It was not screaming FANTASY much, but I still enjoyed it a lot! This story was quite interesting, and I can\'t compare it withHunger Gamesbecause I haven\'t read that series, but it gave meShatter Mevibes (as in powers and some scenes).•Kingdom of Ilya is divided into two types of groups, ELITES (with powers) and ORDINARIES (powerless).Elites were gifted with different powers because of a PLAGUE, and the ordinaries were banished from the Kingdom because they\'re rumored to lessen the powers of the elites!The plot was plotting and IT WAS SO GOOD 😌 though, this book had a lot of repetition (flirting and banter), and was def tropey, it is still SO CUTE! The ending was so angsty, and I DAMN WELL KNOW THAT THE NEXT BOOK IS GONNA BE FULL OF ANGST!😭Kai Azer— PRINCE WHO KILLS PEOPLE WITH NO POWER, BUT IS OBSESSED WITH THE GIRL WHO\'S POWERLESS!!!!! What else do you want??? He\'s so hot for fuck\'s sake! 😭Dark hairs, Gray eyes with loose black shirts, cocky smirk AND DIMPLES.😮\u200d💨The reason this was more rom-com type to me because he was so flirty! He was so gentle and sweet with her. He so selflessly helped her so many times without caring about himself and constantly teased and had fun with her.like letting her pin him with a dagger to the throat, silently asking permission to touch her, braiding her hair, dancing with her, doing anything to protect her life, counting her freckles, stayed awake whole night just to watch her and being affected with just her putting her finger on him! jakshsjssb 😭😭 and...... HE WROTE ON HIS HAND ""she said I can touch her when I\'m sober"" WHEN HE WAS DRUNK 😭🧎\u200d♀️His character was kinda givingAaron Warnervibes because HE\'S A FREAKING WIELDER (he can wield anyone\'s power if they are near) also MAJOR DADDY ISSUES 👺Paedyn Gray— I\'m sorry but EW NAME 💀 She was cool, the way her fighting is described is amazing, and it was easy to imagine! How she fought and no doubt she was pretty strong and amazing on the fighting aspect and how she was trained so perfectly. Her backstory and all didn\'t quite hit me much just like Kai\'s.❝Promise me you’ll stay alive long enough to stab me in the back?❞yes she will LITERALLY and FIGURATIVELY! 👺She has both the prince (Kai and his brother - kitt) wrapped around her finger.THEY BOTH ARE SO SMITTEN 😭, and she was also trying to make Kai her enemy in the start, and ngl prettyyy forced, but glad they lost sight of that lol! I\'m so glad she wasn\'t horny and was pretty annoyed with Kai and wanted nothing with him! Her being attracted to him didn\'t happen quickly, rather it developed slowly but nicely.I won\'t say that her wearing a different color to a ball (where everyone wore green) was pick meHermione Grangervibes lol, but it was definitely cool of her though! Also, SHE\'S THE MAIN CHARACTER SO LET HER SHINE!Her saying \'Gonna stab you in the heart\' was literally the 288262th time. She\'sVicious little thingas he called her. (reminded me of Violet)❝They chose me to die. And all because I saved that prick of a prince.❞•Pae is a thief, and she robbed Kai when he visited the town, and Kai was drawn to her because of the fact that he couldn\'t sense any power from her.Then she saved Kai from a Silencer (one who diminishes power), She caught the eye of everyone as the silver savior, and got selected for Purging Trials — where different trials are taken place for an elite to win. And this year, Kai is a part of them! Now she has to figure out how to SURVIVE because she\'s without power.The whole trials plot was good, but everything was a bit descriptive, and the story was falling into repetition (flirting, banter, and fluff only), and the trials were interesting, but the pace of each of them was different. One taking a lot of chapters, and the other ending in just 3.Many errors in it so the author should def change her editorotherwise everything was fine.

OH MY GOSH~•~•~That ending hurt. A lot.*deep breath* Okay let\'s get started with the review.I absolutely adored this book.The world created is so mesmerizing. The characters and storyline are so compelling. Both the leads- Paedyn and Kai are lovable. I\'ll be honest, this book is not perfect but I enjoyed it regardless.✔️ Magic system✔️ Forbidden romance✔️ Angsty slow burn✔️ Mutual pining✔️ Knife to the throat✔️ Tending to scars✔️ ""Who did this to you?""✔️ He kills for herThe book imostarts off a tad slowbut it\'s completely understandable as we are getting to know the world, the fantasy elements and the characters. It picks up pace towards the middle and stays consistent.An issue I had with this book and which is why it wasn\'t a perfect read for me is the fact that it reminded me TOO MUCH of The Hunger Games.I appreciate when authors take inspiration from a book and make something new with it but the first half of this book was a bit too much replication. This is not to damper anyone\'s expectations but rather give a realistic approach. I still enjoyed it quite a lot which you can see from my updates but it would have been perfect had this issue not existed.I absolutely LOVED the charactersand the complexities that came with them. Kai and Paedyn were imperfectly perfect. They have so much depth and life to them, it was hard to resist them.Kaiis going straight to my book boyfriends list. The man is capable of making me swoon and feel things by merely saying a few words and they don\'t even have to be romantic. He radiates such energy, charisma, and obviously his powers intrigues me a lot. The way he is so smitten with Pae is everything. For him, she is the only girl in the room. For him, she is his and he\'ll do anything to keep her alive and safe.Paedynis no less. She is fierce, equally charismatic and full of zeal and the woman knows how much power she holds in her flirtations, touches over Kai. Her confidence and the ability to stay strong is so impressive. I loved how she holds her own. She tried so hard to resist the charms of the prince and yet found herself wanting him more and I absolutely loved it.The romance is deliciously angsty and slow burning.I get some people are on the surface cause it\'s YA and don\'t really want to give it a go cause of that but believe me you\'re gonna be missing out on the beauty of these two and their intense chemistry. I didn\'t find myself yearning for spice, everything about these two hit perfectly and I wouldn\'t change a thing about it at all.The side characters,Kittin particular, are deeply complex. I saw him destined to become the king that he did at the end, from the beginning. It didn\'t come as a surprise. I found myself sympathizing with him and Kai more so for Pae. I don\'t mind Kitt becoming someone he wasn\'t meant to be, it\'s going to make things immensely interesting. Jax and A were my other favourites.The ending was predictable imo.I saw it coming ages ago so although I wasn\'t completely shocked, it was still impactful and made me excited to read the next one.Overall, an enjoyable read and one I absolutely love. It has the potential of becoming my favorite series but will see how the next books go 😉 What y\'all waiting for? Give it a read!!Like Powerless? Read these-1. The Hunger Games2.

LET\'S GOOO'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'dnf p.308do you ever have the feeling while reading that a book is trying too hard to be something it isn’t?to phrase it simply\'powerless\'has zero originally in it. the book is a replica of many popular books, such asThe Hunger Games, butmake it a cheap and bland AliExpress version. it consisted of recycled scenes jam-packed with tropes that the author was unable to mold to enhance and improve the storyline with. In the end, it appeared that she desperately attempted to sew and combine multiple clichéd scenes to force the protagonists to be in a sort of forced proximity. & it simply did not blend well because the final patchwork felt everything but spontaneous.while the intrigue was compelling enough to dive into the book at first, the unclear and blurry world building made it quite boring after a few chapters. I was under the impression that the author would simplify and distill explanations throughout the story. (how many powers there’s in the wild, for exemple.) but the main question that puzzled the entirety of the book was\'why the trials?\'. i believed it was ancestral, but it wasn\'t. we were not given a concret clarification of why they had to go through them. (solely for the sake of money? sure.)the writing was mediocre to say the least, with an abondance of”blue eyes""not very well dispatched in the narrative. repetitive expressions that clearly underline that the author needs to urgently change editors. the predictability in the dialogues was a major issue for me. It appeared thatKai and Pae were constantly attempting to make the most stereotypical comments. even the king\'s speeches were not as majestic as they should have been.the lack of depth in the characters was the primary reason for my difficulty in going through these 500 pages. why didn\'t the author incorporate any other colors into Pae\'s character other than her still mourning her deceased father? or to Kai to aspire to be more than the future enforcer ? all he does is complain and mop about his obligation to kill people and his brother\'s inability to handle it if the roles where inversed. instead of it being a well depicted enemies to lovers with good character’s wisdom and portrayal it just wavered into them already thinking about each other in a romantic way. all that because the narrative forced them to spend a lot of time with each other.how do you persuade readers to want to continue a trilogy when they aren\'t that attached to the protagonists in the first place?⚠️⚠️⚠️spoilersi did not sign for a love triangle.the way pae inlassably brought up her father’s death and how Kai made strange comments about his first murder seemed like he killed her father not the king.——-here we go..'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'you should know i’m honest to my core when i tell you that i love the author - i think she is an angel of a human being - but i really did not love her book. tragic considering i went in expecting to enjoy it. one day i will stop getting bamboozled by this exact variety of tiktok hype but that day is apparently not today!!!similar to the hunger games i guess if you are ok with nothing making in-universe sense and the reasoning behind it all being “🤷\u200d♀️ i dunno, vibes?” instead of a thoughtful critique of capitalism, commodification, and spectacle.i think i could have gotten past that though (not everything has to be that serious lmfao i am an ali hazelwood fan…i would be throwing stones from a GLASS HOUSE) but the writing was just so over the top and longwinded-but-also-average-fanfiction-vibes in a way that is difficult to capture in a review but that you’d get right away reading the book. it is this very specific style where the author says something, and then says it again but with other words that start with the same letters, and then the sentence has ~parallelism~ but also it is so obviously baked in that it loses any impact. like: ""she was Bold and Beautiful and Beyond my Bountiful expectations."" but x1000 all throughout the book. i found it pretty hard to get through by the end.with that said - i am but one (1) girl, this is a minority opinion. most people i trust online like this book. i think if the writing style doesn’t bother you this could be mindlessly fun a la fourth wing. it doesn\'t take itself particularly seriously. the central relationship is very slow burn and has ample yearning/a decent foundation - though it is quite instalove in terms of their individual feelings, NOT legitimate enemies to lovers (they like each other lmao) and the banter (much like the writing) is often over the top. the story has a mountain of cliches - but they are cliches for a reason. sometimes you just want something silly that is full of all of your guilty pleasure tropes. this was not my experience. but it could be yours, and i hope lauren keeps writing!!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3 starsit’s time to be honest.let me start by saying that i didn’t (and still don’t) know who lauren is on booktok. sothis review is unbiased as possible. 🫶🏻(please don’t forget that a 3 stars isn’t a bad rating either.)the first half of this book was nearly a copy and paste of the hunger games.while some readers probablywantthat, it took away from originality for me. i could NOT stop comparing for storyline.

For this being Lauren’s first book, I was impressed. It has a solid storyline and great characters. Overall, I didn’t hate it and can’t wait to see how the story will continue.I will say I wish the world building was more in depth and expanded, along with the characters. This story felt a lot like the Red Queen in terms of general plot but I did like her personal touch, however it was on the borderline of copying rather than “inspired by” if you know what I’m saying.

Because beasts don’t get the beauty.🪷 bottom line 🪷you must go read this!!if this review didn’t convince you, idk what will. i’ve seen loads of people say this is just acopy paste of red queen and hunger games, but unfortunately i haven’t read them to confirm. but maybe if you like those you’ll enjoy this too? or hate it bc it’s basically the same thing LMAOOI love kai and paedyn, and although july is so far away, it’s also very close! so it’s nice knowing I have something to look forward to when I finish hiatus <3happy reading pookies 😽🫶🏼MWAH ILY….i feel likecrying. andscreamingin frustration. bc that ending hurt and suddenly july feels way too far. im going to need the most cutesy, happy, feel-good romcom to help me heal from the insane amount of anxiety i had reading this ❤️\u200d🩹5 stars. rtc <3'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Listen, I’m no author but I know a bad book when I read it.I know this is a debut novel so I’m gonna be mad at the publishers and people who recommend this saying this was a masterpiece with so much tension💀(Did somebody even drafted this before publishing it?I found 5 errors of editing.)Here’s a booktuber reviewing this book and she explains my feeling better🥰:https://youtu.be/KJgWwwI2ki4?si=vOITs...Idk where to start so let’s just dive in:)❗️(This review contains spoilers for both RED QUEEN and POWERLESS and it’s a very direct review so if you can’t stand that or loved this book, don’t read it please. Thank you🥰)❗️•It was a Red queen fan fiction.•Zero original ideas.•The last 40 pages were the only interesting and unique plot from the author.•Long boring (bad structured) paragraphs•Wattpad diologue.•Lazy writing.•The Characters reactions made no sense.•Enemies to lovers? More like: forced and lazy interactions to enemies (ig)•Quotes that felt repetitive or were directly written many times in the same page or chapter.⚔️ “Inspired by Red queen and The hunger games” = excuse to not say she copied everything about those two series and changed some aspects or characters in the most lazy way. Example:The cream that cures Katniss and it’s sent from Haymitch is changed into: Kai finding a remedy to cure Paedyn because it might’ve fallen from another person’s pocket. LIKE WHAT?⚔️Everything about the trials was boring and didn’t make any sense. When it first started I was like: Finally! 200 pages of nothing, maybe it gets better and then boom IT NEVER DID.⚔️Paedyn and Kitt had more chemistry than Paedyn and Kai (it felt so forced). They were ALWAYS finding each other (also another way to never develop the other characters that had a lot of potential since they all had different and interesting powers). The “I hate you” but I have no idea why was SO HARD IN THIS BOOK.⚔️When I got to Kai’s POV, he was always saying that she wanted to be enemies but in reality they were always flirting and touching each other because they have to have “quemistry” but apparently you also have to force an enemies to lovers trope because what is revealed at the end has to make sense but it never does. It’s very clear that there is NO reason for you to hate Kai because of his “beauty” and the fact that he remains you of his father. Which also leads me to talk about the king and queen:⚔️THE QUEEN was never there, she loved Kai but never did anything for him. Why? We are given a poor excuse that that was correct for him and he was always destined to become the enforcer and suffer.⚔️THE KING and his personality that didn’t make sense, bother me SO MUCH and let’s not talk about his poor dialogues. He was the reason of all the tragedies and traumas but he was even sharing dinner in the same table with everyone!!!😁You can do that, yes! My problem is that he doesn’t have a well developed personality leading his character to become ridiculous in the eyes of the reader.⚔️And I say instead of forcing Kai and Paedyn to find each other ALL THE TIME use all those pages to make her interact with the other characters like Lenny: cuz wdym he calls you princess and likes you out of nowhere (remember if you’re writing a book you are telling the story to the readers not to you! So even if it looks “obvious” you have to develop that relationship and write it directly)⚔️Also, let’s not talk about the amount of ridiculous nicknames🙄🙄🙄⚔️Adena was there at the beginning and at the end, leaving me like: ok you love her so much but she’s barely mentioned throughout the book.⚔️The father taught her how to fight and he was a healer 💀The characters had NO personality, only plain mid and typical backstories.⚔️If you haven’t read Red Queen then you probably are not going to understand why I said this book is a Red Queen fan fiction:•Adena: Mare’s sister. They both design clothes.•Kai: Cal but with a flirting personality (oh but let’s not forget that we have to force him into a dark “I don’t share my feelings cuz I’m a monster” character.) Also, what’s with Paedyn describing him as a cocky bastard and two pages latter saying that he was this mysterious guy 🧍🏻\u200d♀️.•Kitt: Naive prince who’s clearly becoming the villain at the end: Maven.⚔️And I could go on and on but honestly it bores me to tears to remember all of the characters because that’s what the story was: plain and boring(unnecessarily long).⚔️Like I said: a Fan fiction (dare I say that Red queen was at least more unique) and it felt as if the author wrote this and never check it before publishing it. It was like: here🤲🏻 theres this book that feels incredibly overwhelming and it has a lot of tropes that are a favorite on booktok but I didn’t develop them well.⚔️I’ve said this before and I’m gonna say it again: There is one book on Wattpad that includes royals and everything and it was 100% better than this “book”. So if you read books in Spanish you should definitely give it a try!!! It’s called EL PERFUME DEL REY. (And yes I read this recently so there is no: I read this in 2015 you’ll probably not like it now) The book is also in a physical copy!!! And has illustrations😍⚔️People recommend this saying that is very cheesy and it’s for a younger audience, when in reality there are BETTER books with VERY YA scenes like: Once upon a broken heart that were actually good (I’m 18)⚔️Anyway. I say, read this if you want to but I still think it’s not fair that you have to pay 20$ for something that copied basically everything from other popular books and everyone on booktok is hyping it knowing damn well this has a poor plot and it should be on Wattpad.⚔️Im gonna say this a last time: I paid for this book and I feel like at least I deserve to give my opinion on it and WHY I didn’t like it.I gave it 1⭐️ because Ik there could be more improvement and it’s also very impressive that somebody wrote 500 pages at 18!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""What in The-Hunger-Games-Divergent-Serpent-and-the-Wings-of-Night-Throne-of-Glass-Young-Elites-Shatter-Me fandom mash-up is this?Disclaimer:I know nothing of the author and don’t keep up with BookTok books, so this review is unbiased in every possible way. Even in moments where I may diss the book, I have absolutely nothing against the author and am open to reading her future releases.That being said, I have lost faith in humanity.I truly do not understand the hype for this. At all. There are so many other, better written fantasy romance novels out there.It wasn’t just that this was unoriginal and bad writing, but the romance was awful, the characters bland, the plot pacing so damn slow with so many pointless scenes, and every plot aspect was absolutely RIDDLED with logistic issues. If you take the time to look at things for half a second, the whole thing falls apart irrevocably.This whole thing hinges upon tropes and other peoples’ nostalgia and love for to all the books I just listed above.People are actually recommending this to fans of The Hunger Games.For the love of God, if you are a true fan of The Hunger Games, DO. NOT. pick this up.This is SO bad that to compare it to that is to make a mockery of the franchise.The concept of The Hunger Games has a sick sort of logic to it that makes sense.This, whatever trials were in Powerless, did not make sense.So the whole conflict in this world is that the king basically kills all the powerless, called Ordinaries, and the Fatals, which are the those who have powers so strong they are a threat to everyone, Ordinary or Elite. He does this to keep the Elites strong and him in power, believing that reproducing with Ordinaries will deplete the Elite’s power overtime.Okay. Fine. But then why would you host the Purging Trials where many of your treasured elites might die?? Not only that, but to contradict again, it’s literally said multiple times that the trials are meant to showcase powers, not to kill other contestants. But with a name like the PURGING trials, what else do you think the contestests are going to do? Come on. Also, most of the contestants are literally childhood friends or acquaintances, and you’re telling me they’re nonchalantly killing them off, when it’s not even required to win the trials? I’m sorry, but I’m not rooting for or sympathizing with ANY of these sadistic characters. This isn’t morally grey, this is pure evil.Building upon the issues I’ve already brought up and my many questions that remain unanswered, the novel is a mess of plot holes.I’m sure most of this is due to the fact that the plot was not born from an idea—whether it be world, character, or plot based. It’s built from a trope, which is never a solid foundation for a book.I am so tired of this new trend of trope-dumping. Sure, tropes are nice, even amazing, in extreme moderation. And even then, thetropes should not be the driving force in a novel or even in plot progression.These are like literary devices, used to elicit a certain atmosphere or feeling, whether in the story or readers. Tropes do not a plot make. They are not a substitute, they are not character building, they are not even effective romance development techniques. So please, for all of our sake, let's move on!There are many more plot holes, but at this point my frustration over it all, while writing this, is becoming unhealthy so I’ll just stop while I’m ahead.There is nothing of substance to the characters.Nothing to differentiate them from one another and nothing to make them anything but the basic stereotypes of whatever role they’re intended to fulfill.Prince Kai is the worst of them all. He’s supposed to be some badass, monstrous assassin for the king. But nothing ever backs up these claims. In fact, Roberts goes so overboard on his charming nature (which is more cringeworthy than actually charming) and his romantic feelings for the FMC that he’s honestly softer than every other character in the novel. Result the exact opposite of the intention, I’m sure.Paedyn has the most pick-me energy that I’ve had the displeasure of reading in recent memory. She screams Wattpad fanfic on the basis of she has no flaws, her only weakness being her supposed love for others and her unparalleled heroism.The dialogue between characters is the worst.I could not keep my face straight when I read it; the secondhand embarrassment was worse than the experience of watching DUFF or Awkward. (Y’all know what I’m talking about, I know you do).The romance is terrible. I tried to think of a better way to put it, but I could not without altering the truth of the matter.Why, why, why do we follow this ridiculous love triangle between Paedyn and the two royal brothers, Kai and Kitt? For one, this screams heavily influenced by Red Queen. For another, the novel is literally a fantasy romance told from the perspectives of Paedyn and Kai. We know it’ll be their romance in the end, because Kitt’s POV is not included. So why waste our time? It literally adds nothing to the story.Onto the actual romance at the forefront of the novel, this is as insta-love as it can possibly get, folks. Sometimes, insta-love is called for, most of the time it’s not. Have I ever liked it either way? Absolutely the fuck not, there’s the door.🚪Kai and Paedyn have no chemistry. How could they when they’re lusting over one another from the moment they lay eyes on each other? Their romance goes from 0-100 REAL QUICK, and I’m talking 30% of the way in. Then, as if the author remembers that, actually, we need to slip the “slow burn” trope in, she decides the characters need to blatantly fawn over one another for damn near the rest of the book but do nothing about it. Literally, what is the purpose? The slow burn doesn’t hit the same if you’ve already solidified the romance in the first 100 pages.Anyway, I did not like this. Pick up some Carissa Broadbent instead, okay folks?""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This was not good. As a trending booktok book, I didn’t really know what I was getting into because those are always a bit of a toss up, but it was still one of my most anticipated releases.The main issue with Powerless is that it was written FOR social media. It was written around popular tropes even if putting in those tropes was completely out of place and forced. Now listen, I’m not against using popular tropes or anything, but they’re only effective if they come naturally and actually have a reason to be there. It felt completely unoriginal because I had read it all before.And it wasn’t just the tropes that made this book so unoriginal. I swear that this was just a carbon copy of The Hunger Games x Red Queen. The characters were all 2D versions of characters from the Hunger Game, the world building was literally the exact same as in Red Queen except if the Red Queen Universe hosted an annual Hunger Games, and the plot was just a bunch of copy and pasted moments from both. I understand that with fantasy books you’re always going to see some parallels between books, but this was insane. It was so so bad. Every page was deja vu and not in a good way. As someone who loved the Hunger Games (not Red Queen as much but I can respect it), some of this honestly felt a little disrespectful because it was so similar yet there was no meaningfulness or relevance to everything. THG is a commentary on our modern-day capitalist society and so many of the scenes and premises that were blatantly copied in this book actually held incredible importance in THG but were just thrown in with no meaning or thought whatsoever here.Then there was the romance, the reason we’re all here. I feel kind of 50/50 on this because Kai and Paedyn did have some “chef’s kiss” moments, but the tension was so overdone. When you put in so much sexual tension, there comes a point where it’s no longer tense. I also hated how Kai was always calling Pae “darling,” not because I hate that name or anything, but because it was used all the time and felt really forced. I also don’t understand all the nose flicking. Why was Kai always flicking Paedyn’s nose for no apparent reason. That will never not be weird. Nonetheless, it was one of the book’s better aspects which is great because it is, in fact, romantasy.The writing also wasn’t too bad, especially considering that this is a debut novel. However, the use of the term “ocean eyes” was literally criminal and I don’t think I’ll be able to listen to that song again (iykyk). Oh, and “cocky bastard” too. We can do better than that.The world building, like I said before, was completely unoriginal, but it also made about 0 sense. I mean, the whole idea behind the Purging Trials is so that the kingdom can showcase the power of the elites, but the whole thing was so flimsy. Like, you’re going to have a bunch of people with powers go fight each other (and kill each other, although it was never explained if that was the actual goal or what) and film them for… entertainment purposes? Don’t even get me started on the whole history with the Elites and Ordinaries with the Plague and everything. So many plot holes in this regard.I will say that this book was very entertaining and bingeable. Despite the fact that I kind of hated it, it still would be one of my go-to’s for a reading marathon or a long trip or something like that.In the end, this was a huge letdown for me. It really is an interesting example of how social media is effecting the book industry and, while I think there are some good things that come out of this, I really have a lot of issues with it. Honestly, Powerless was so formulaic that it almost felt like it was generated by AI (I know it wasn’t- I’ve been following Lauren Roberts on social media for a while and I’ve seen what she’s put into this book). I know the that a lot of people love this book but it wasn’t for me. 2 stars.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“But I’m never sober around you, Pae. Never not drunk on every detail that is you.”Infinity x Infinity 🌟’s⚔My Thoughts⚔Usually I am not into reading slow burn romance books. Like if they have a friends to lovers trope I’m not really interested in it bc its so slow at least in my opinion. Sometimes it can be at the very end of the book where the two characters kiss and it\'s just hard to wait that longi’m kind of impatient when it comes to romance 🙉BUT…. this book kind of changed my perspective a little bit. To say I really liked this is an understatement. It’s such a beautiful, playful and humorous book. The plot the characters especially the characters specifically the female character, PAE!!! She is such a inspiration to all people especially girls!! I just love the way she carried herself and just went through the competition with such grace, passion, and determination. This book also reminded me a lot of my favorite dark romance series Blood and Ash series. The threats of how stabbing turns people on is just giving Casteel from blood and ash and it was like living deja vu all over again. But yeah this book had a little something of everything and I loved it sm!! I will say as someone who isn\'t really a slowburn fan I’m thinking about reconsidering after reading this. 💗 Infinity x Infinity stars all around!!!⚔Main Characters⚔☘Pae☘This girl is my heart and soul!! I love her sm!! She is such a powerful female character. I love how she doesn’t try to just fit in with the other girls. Every chance she got she spoke up and expressed her feelings. And even when she wasn’t trying to she was so funny. Her relationship with Kai is just so cute and so romantic. Ik they didn’t really get a good kiss but Ik they’re is definitely something special for them in the cards. I really hope that she is still able to continue to being herself no matter what even after what happened. Usually its rare to get this much female agency throughout a whole book let alone a series so I’m hoping that she is able to just be true to herself and keep fighting for her relationship with Kai no matter what. Also can we just talk about the dresses she wore with the high slit and the dagger on her thigh and didn\'t even bat an eye at the traditional dresses that everyone had to wear that was all the same color. I’m talking badass girl right there!! 🎀💘💖☘Kai☘Kai is literally the book guy everyone wants. 😍He is so funny and smart. He cares sm eventho he doesn’t seem like he does at first. He literally spared people when he was supposed to kill them And ofc he is absolutely so handsome. Like I was giggling and kicking my feet he was just so cute and so entertaining to read about. And the way he always put caring for Pae over his other duties was just so thoughtful and he is literally on of the best mmc in like book history. And I loved when he was so attentive to Pae and always found some way to crack a joke while flirting was just so swoonworthy. 😋 Like idk how I’m going to survive while Reckless isn’t here yet. And there was one scene I loved sm when they were talking about feelings and she was trying to put her walls up and he like next time don’t tap your left foot and lie to me. Like somehow he just knew.⚔Side Characters⚔The were all pretty decent the best friend was my favorite. She was so sweet and I wish things could have been better (if you know you know) I’m not even going to talk about the father I didn’t like him at all. But the brother ofc I ended up liking him too especially when he was flirting with Pae �� but midway I kinda just stopped idk why I just think he wasn’t that interesting like I thought.⚔Best Couple Moments⚔🌸Their 1st\xa0 meet up🌱Gifted her a knife🌸Kai putting food on Pae’s plate for her bc she was refusing to eat and she seemed shy🌱Their little fights🌸Their dance lessons🌱Everytime he called her darling🌸Her favorite color is blue bc she loves his eye color🌱He helped her through her panic attack🌸He wrote on his arm ‘she said I could touch her when I’m sober’🌱Pae comforting Kai during his nightmare🌸Their picnic in the garden⚔Favorite Scenes⚔▪︎“Do you always fall into the arms of handsome strangers, or is it a new thing for you?” (Kai)“No, only the cocky ones.” (Pae)“Well looks like I’ve made quite the first impression then.

Who did this to you?” (Kai)▪︎“Oh, I’m not making you do anything, darling. You can leave me to bleed out if you must. Because I only want your hands all over me if you want them to be.” (Kai)▪︎”You know. I’m beginning to think that you enjoy getting hurt, if only so you can have my hands all over you.” (Kai)▪︎”Who needs a pillow when I have you?” (Kai)▪︎”You know you didn’t have to spill my drink all over me to get me alone.” (Kai)▪︎”It’s not the winning that I find fun. It’s you, darling.” (Kai)▪︎“But I’m never sober around you, Pae.

I think it was kinda something we all knew partly bc of events that led up to it. However what happened with Kai was shocking bc usually stuff like that has gone differently but ih this was a new twist to the book which was so heartbreaking. And like the history with their fathers was crazy. I wish I could say more but I don\'t want to spoil it for those who haven\'t read it.⚔Hopes for Reckless⚔🌱More Kai and Pae romance🌸The ending resolved🌱More humor⚔Last Thoughts⚔I really liked this book a lot and I\'m hoping the next one delivers and it doesn\'t end up like the way Ruthless Vows was.

i went into this book blindly and had no idea what to expect with this story, and to say, im so glad i did bc i was pleasantly astounded by what unfolded.. the hype surrounding this book is very much justified. this was an enchanting story, i just adored watching roman and iris find love through a magical connection. their love was so tender and emotionally raw.➷ this story weaves an enthralling tale of war and the blossoming romance intertwined within its turmoil. divine rivals unfolds within the world war I-esque setting, a raging war happening between two gods who are using humans as their troops to cause devastation. there are elements of trench warfare and the overall impacts of the loss through war. the descriptions were realistic and brutal.➷ the letters are no doubt the best part of this book, they were so intimate and i simply can’t get over them. the writing in each letter just had so much raw honesty and an undercurrent of longing. you could feel their emotions pour out of each letter!! they formed a connection through loss and grief and sought solace in one another through letters. rebecca ross has the most beautiful, poetic writing style ever, she is an expert in lyrical prose, it completely enchanted me—i absolutely adore the way she delicately crafts her words, it was so exquisitely beautiful.“if there’s anything i can should say in this moment when my heart is beating wildly in my chest and i would beg you to come and tame it—is this: your letters have been a light for me to follow. your words? a sublime feast that fed me on days when i was starving. i love you iris.”➳ this story follows iris winnow, an ambitious journalist who dropped out of school after her brother went off to war to fight for the goddess enva and she does her best to care for her alcoholic mother — she gets a job at a local, prestigious newspaper writing obituaries to earn money to pay the bills. after a devastating incident happens, iris packs up her life, leaves oath and travels 600km away to the front lines of the war to find her missing brother. she gets a job as a war correspondent and uncovers the harsh truths on the devastating war that is occurring. this is where the story truly comes alive as it explores the experience of trench warfare.iris is well-crafted character who is the easiest character to root for!! her vulnerability and struggles with abandonment and fear of never being good enough were tangible. she is very strong-willed, compassionate and empathetic — i adored how she always goes out of her way to help others were in need, befriends them and listens to what they have to say. she’s faced many challenges but she is still very earnest.➳ roman, charming and witty and the polar opposite to iris. he comes from a wealthy family and is much more privileged compared to iris but he wants to make his own way in life. but omggg i want this man for myself. the way he abandoned his family obligations and followed iris into the war zone bc he couldn’t bear the thought of being without her?! the way he loves iris so deeply and shows up for her every single time?? when he was in immense pain and couldn’t walk so he crawled just so he could reach her.. now that broke my heart into tiny lil pieces!!

I wouldn't change a thing.Does it end on a brutal cliffhanger?A BIG FAT YES. Am gonna be crying for days.In a slump after Fourth Wing?Grab this book.THIS IS YOUR SIGN TO BUY IT. IT IS WORTH THE MONEYYYYYYY'all can probably tell how much I loved this book. The people are not lying, this is worth the hype.✔️ Read if you like Shadow and Bone✔️ Historical fantasy romance✔️ Rivals to lovers✔️ Pen palsIris (FMC)andRoman (MMC)have been working and competing for the position of a columnist alongside each other at the local newspaper. There's no denying that there's spark between the two but can they overcome the rivalry as the war of gods loom over. Amidst the brutal war and magical creatures, finding solace in letters, in each other's company seems to fill them with hope and something more.Theworld buildingis not too complex, it might seem that way in the beginning but the author sets the stage brilliantly. Never info dumping, she paces the history of the towns, the platoons, the creatures and the gods-Enva and Dacrebeautifully. The typewriters sure are an interesting feature. It came so naturally and was so easy to read, love when authors do it right. Thepacingis consistent, not too fast not too slow. I was so mesmerized by her writing, the story and the characters, I was envisioning it all and didn't know where the time went.One of the underrated things is the way the author dealt with heavy topics-war, grief and loss of lifeplay a big part in this book. So if any of the things feel uncomfortable, do reconsider as it is a very emotional book. The way it's depicted and the sheer raw emotion written wasbeautifully heartbreaking to read.There were side characters who were just there for a few pages but they made me cry. They made an impact. The words they carried were powerful.Thecharactersmade this story so amazing.💠Iris-She is such an interesting and lovable FMC. Although she is just 18 but there's so much maturity to her. The way we see her struggles, battling emotions and presenting a tough exterior for her brother, for her mother and whoever close to her- is commendable. The way she is ready to protect others and put others first is beautiful to see.✒️Roman-I loved him from page 1 itself. A 19 year old with zeal. A bit grumpy in the beginning but there are reasons for that. The way he was dead set on doing anything and everything for Iris 🤌 The way he was never shy to show love. The way he was never held Iris back. The way he fell for her ❤️\u200d🔥 He is full of charms and wit and ready to be with Iris no matter what.Need me a Roman 😭His story about Del made me sob NGL.Thesupporting charactersare a nice addition to Iris and Roman's and the gods story. I likedAttiea lot and am sure I will love Lilac too. I likedMarisoland her 'mom energy' andKeegantoo however short a while we see her for.Forestis sure an interesting character and I won't elaborate on it further due to spoilers. Y'all but I really want to seeSarahachieve her dream 😭Theromancewas PERFECT 🤌 It's so deliciously sweet and swoon worthy, I fell in love with their love. The chemistry is present right from the beginning. I loved how both of them are so into each other and especially Roman, who is never afraid to show it. The sweet spicy moment in a YA book was beautiful to read. I loved how their relationship developed and grew stronger and stronger.Theendingabsolutely broke me. I knew something would go wrong but had no idea of the intensity of it. It was such a brutal cliffhanger and with the epilogue, am crying again just by thinking about it.I cannot recommend it enough y'all. Easily one of the best books I read this year. It's definitely going to be one of my favourites ever and I already cannot wait to reread it. Books like these make me realise why I love reading so much 🥺❤️ I honestly want to protect and cherish my copy of it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDGuys, just trust me.~•~•~LET'S GOOO 🙌🤞~•~•~Eep my copy just arrived and it is so beautiful. Cannot wait to get to it, have high hopes""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""How did the promise of a war between gods turn into a middling historical fiction with a lackluster romance and nary a whiff of fantasy? I'm honestly a bit stunned.I went intoDivine Rivalswith high expectations. I'd seen the gushing reviews and the deluge of 5-star ratings. And I'd gotten a taste for romantasy and I wanted more. In fact, I was so certain I was going to love this that I saved it for just the right moment when I'd need a little extra zing in my reading repertoire.So I settled myself in, ready to be swept away in a fantasy of epic proportions, with an enemies-to-lovers romance for the ages. And how can it not be amazing, with gods at war and two rivaling journalists who don't fight with their swords but with their words. Yes! Except no, because this didn't really deliver on any of it.Instead, what I got was more or less a historical fiction. The fantasy element is so diminutive, I felt like I could blink and miss it. You see, the gods were unhappy with each other, and they're recruiting humans to fight in their war. And that's pretty much it for the fantasy part. Oh, and there's some magic in old houses and typewriters. You can see how that would be disappointing for a reader expecting, well, more than that.The majority of the story is told from Iris's perspective and she never really gelled into an interesting character for me. At every step, she does what you would expect a character to do, nothing more, nothing less. Her brother is fighting in the war, so she misses him. She sees an opportunity to join the war effort, so she does. There's a cute boy at the office, so she's attracted to him. But there's another nice boy she writes with, so she's attracted to him too. At no point did she surprise me in any way. I found Roman to be the more compelling character, but his perspective is only a little bit here and there.As for the romance, it was serviceable but ultimately uninspiring. There was no real chemistry, no banter, no spark, nothing that made me swoon or crack a smile. The majority of it played out via Iris and Roman's letters to each other, and they felt distinctly YA. The writing was deep in the way of teenagers, but much ado about nothing for old folks like me. In fact, it reminded me of AOL chat logs from back in the day. I wonder if I were to dig up my own from my teenage days, it would come up similarly bland and overwrought.That isn't to say I didn't enjoy any of it because I did. But I kept waiting for that moment when the words I'm reading on the page would turn into an immersive experience, and it never did. Every element in here—the war, the fantasy, the characters, their writing, the romance—was pleasant enough to while away a few hours, but in that take it or leave it kind of way.No one's more disappointed than me. Compared to what I had imagined in my head, this story paled in comparison. But to be fair, part of that was my fault. What I wanted and what I got were complete opposites. I'm a huge fan of romance and fantasy, which this isn't really, and not a fan of wartime historical fiction, which is all this is.For all my complaints, I did get some enjoyment out of it. And since it's a duology and I already own the second book, I'll go ahead and finish the series. Fingers crossed that the second book has more of the exciting elements I'm looking for.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

My only wish is that we got to delve more into the gods/mythology and the politics of the war but based on how the book ended, I'm thinking we might get more of that in book 2!""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'so much potential wasted, this book literally takes place in the middle of a war with gods and all we get is a magical typewriter and a bland ass “rivals” to lovers romance. maybe i should’ve picked the authors other book was my first book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Oh how I absolutely adore this book !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '∞ ⭐️ my favorite book of 2023 🥺'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'she writes letters like i did when i was heartbroken at 13 over my minecraft boyfriend'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '*re-read*still 5 stars.

I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”iris:incredible protagonist. the way she thinks, acts and speaks is so amazing, and her love for people she cares about is so so beautiful. also she is incredibly mature, the way she takes care of her drunk mother and works to keep them alive is so heartbreaking. she wears an armor everyday, hiding her family’s poverty, never asking for reassurance even though she feels alone in the world and trying to stand up on her own feet by working her ass of for a job she wants so passionately is so admirable. her seeking the truth at all costs, staying strong while her mom’s showing reckless actions, putting her family above her, not needing anyone and defending herself by her own, knowing her value, wanting to be beautiful just for herself, telling herself she doesn’t needs her mother’s reassurance but gets bolstered when gets it, not crying in front of people, hating when her boss made her resignation sounds like she is giving up, remembering small details about her friends, afraid to love people because she always lose them.. if i see someone saying she is unlikable, watch under your bed bc i’m hiding there.. with a knife 🔪”But if I’ve learned anything from those fools, it is that to be vulnerable is a strength that most of us fear. It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, ‘You will miss so much by being so guarded.”her mind is spectacular, she talks about how much she was hungry, not just for food but for sober conversations with her mother. and the way she uses words; she ‘bled’ herself in her articles and letters, not having motivation and describing the blank page as ‘nothing more than stars and smoke and word pressed on a page’, her writing to roman but also writingfor herself, her understanding how close she can be to people, yet how far away and lonely she can fell.. she is so mature and i get chills every time we get a scope of her articles and letters.“I don’t think you realize how strong you are, because sometimes strength isn’t swords and steel and fire, as we are so often made to believe. Sometimes it’s found in quiet, gentle places. The way you hold someone’s hand as they grieve. The way you listen to others. The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”roman:how to put this man’s selflessness, maturity, smartness and passion to words… he is the most well behaved, smart, dedicated and well spoken man i have ever read.you know miscommunication? reverse it and make it a character and you have roman fucking kitt.his maturity level is reachless, he apologized to iris the second the understood his words came out offensive (unintentionally), asked her if she wants to talk when she looks bothered, said to her that she’ll never be alone, asked for a final assignment since he believes that he had a unfair advantage; you literally can see he cares, not only hear by his words. he doesn’t just sees her, he seesthroughher.honestly i believe that i can make you love him by listing his actions and not even adding my thoughts about him;he quitted his dream job, broke his engagement, stood against his father’s expectations to travel hundreds of kilometers on a train that broke down and walked his way through the war just to be with the girl he loves.this is not enough? okay,he was the only one to check her when she didn’t show up at work, waited behind her door until he was sure that she locked it, gets so worried about her being wounded that he couldn’t bear to sit and wondered through till 3am, rereads all the letters that iris has sent to him every night before bed, crawled to her while he was bleeding and dying, trying to reach her in his last breath.HE PRACTICALLY DIED FOR HER.“I pray that my days will be long at your side. Let me fill and satisfy every longing in your soul. May your hand be in mine, by sun and by night. Let our breaths twine and our blood become one, until our bones return to dust. Even then, may I find your soul still sworn to mine.”romaniris:they are fated mates. i don’t care if they are not faes or magical creatures,they are destined to be with each other.god, those letters made me cry like twenty times, the pure love among them cannot be reached by any other couple that exists. roman admiring iris’ writing and taking courage from it, his soul getting a peaceful silence while reading her letters, him being proud when iris acts brave and stands up for her words, devotes himself to her; iris not being afraid to be seen by him at her worst, her sensing the second roman arrives in a room, falling for him twice, being ready to die with him.. they both stated that there was no way for them to live if another dies. they showed each other they both deserve to be loved and be happy, and best way for them to have it was.. being by each other’s side.”But I think there is a magical link between you and me. A bond that not even distance can break.”i want to add some thoughts onwomen friendshipstoo, because they were incredibly sincere and beautiful. marisol taking iris and attie under her wings right away, they all helping each other with chores and acting as a whole, preparing garden for arrival of keegan, attie calling iris her favourite flower, they all encouraging each other, iris calling marisol and attie her family that she is bonded by something deeper than blood, this small details got my eyes watery by showing how much of a special thing to have friends that you can call your home.i wrote so much yet so little, because there is no words to describe how beautiful this book was in the history of languages. this is the part where my reviews ends, however, it encouraged me to write a love letter for two precious humans, so here it is;💌dear shei and bru,i have been always a defender of the fact that distance makes everything fade away, but i believe our friendship is the biggest exception of my belief. we have continents between us, however you two become my home in the last few days. the book was indeed most beautiful literature piece i have ever laid my hands on, but the reason i will carry it in my heart is because of you two, thank you for being iris and attie to my marisol. so sheila luminous de guereñu docampo and bruna transcendent silva barbosa, below the sky i’m walking through, and the depth in my heart, you two aremy little constellations.yours,-s.oct 7:i want ‘cause of death: ending of this book’ written in my tombstone. rtc when i can function again.oct 3:br with my precious girlsbrunaandshei💗""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""—— 5 ✰ stars.'As if I am a puzzle, and im now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again'・❥・ Mood of the book: never let me go by Florence + the machine.'And grief is a long, difficult process, especially when it is so racked by guilt'OKAY.Takes deep breath, sits down, crosses leg and clears throat.Welcome to this mess!!!!

It feels like blisters on your heels. (…) You wish that you could take their place, no matter the cost. “Just so you can have the peace of knowing their fate.”“I love the words I write until I soon realize how much I hate them, as if I am destined to always be at war with myself”The pace of the story varies a lot, at first it is a little slow, then it picks up pace, but it is a little irregular. What I do have to say is that it never bored me. Both my book girls and I, whether due to the time difference or our schedules, found it difficult to stop reading so that the missing one could catch up with us, “one more chapter alone…” and it became 5 more chapters.✧˖*°࿐𝒄𝒉𝒂𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒔:➶-͙˚ ༘✶ 𝑹𝒐𝒎𝒂𝒏 𝑪.

How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.” ✨This truly was such agemof a book.I can’t get over it.Divine rivals couldn’t be any more true to its name as here you have two journalist rivals — Iris and Roman. Both of them find themselves competing for a coveted spot at the newspaper they work at and of course Iris finds her rival infuriating to be around yet handsome but she fails to realize the connection brewing between them.Two enchanted typewriters that are linked, both characters in the midst of an ever growing mystical war among gods, shared grief in their losses, and a divine unbreakable connection that even Roman believes to be true“I think there is a magical link between you and me.” A bond that not even distance can break.”that is what you can expect from thisNow on to what I loved about the characters:Iris and Romans rivals to lovers build up was done as well as could be even if I wanted more . I was relishing in how annoyed he made her and their banter along with the love and vulnerability each shared with each other esp in those letters — letters that only one of them knew who was on the other end and that made it all the more intriguing to see unravelThe letters held such vulnerability yet strength written in them, it was everythingg to read each. Even more when they started signing off their letters as“—Iris and —CtoLove, Iris and Your Kitt”💌I loved loved loved their admiration for each others work and hyping each other up — more so Roman when it came to Iris herself and her words.“Your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving.”My Iris,"" he said, ""there is no question that you are the brave one, all on your own.""I absolutely loved and adored Iris’ character sm. One of my favorite fmcs. Rebecca’s way of portraying her was amazing to see unfold and develop. The tone for her dialogue felt so wise, mature and strong willed. I felt the need to protect her and let her know she wasn’t alone even though she felt that way. But she didn’t need that bc she was self sufficient all on her own“But I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.”She exemplified such strength, bravery, selflessness and determination despite the loneliness and hardships she experienced. I felt like I connected with her and saw her in myself (we love the relatability) and all the way through I was rootingg for her“Get a grip on yourself, she thought, hands on her knees, eyes closed. This is war. This is what you signed up for. Don’t look away from it.”Roman was just so kind, so soft with her, so infuriatingly handsome (in my head), mine and everyone else’s book husband as of now, and so selfless as he dropped everything to follow her! as if I didn’t already love him and he goes and does that while also protecting her with his life. **Roman really made it difficult for me to enjoy a romance when it comes to my expectations in how a man speaks tomethe fmc in a book 😩 I legit melted every time he’d say her name (I imagine it’s soft)“Iris,” he whispered.”soo much whispering but I get why“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt.”I loved the addition of the small found family she found in Marisol and Attie. It warmed my heart to know she had this as she really deserved to have itShe realized this was her family now. That there were bonds that ran deeper than blood.”There were minimal fantasy elements in this but the story on its own was amazing to not to care sm for it. But I have hope the inclusion of the gods is expanded upon further in the next book esp as their characters felt more like an introduction to them in this———————————————Ultimately, this was written so impeccable with such a compelling plot and I was in complete awe because of it. The romance wasexquisite, as was the characterization and the connection between them in their trauma and grief endured. The war aspect was also written in great detail as well with the angst of it depicted for how it truly is and what it’s like.I’m gonna need the next book asap as I have so many questions than answers in what happens next after that cliffhanger??Thank you emara for putting me on to this <33Quotes I loved:“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”“The way you show up, day after day, even when you are weary or afraid or simply uncertain. That is strength, and I see it in you.”“Little flower,” I see it now. The name suits you.P.S. Hi, Iris.”“Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light.”“I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there\'s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tell me, You will miss so much by being so guarded”“I rarely share this part of my life with others, but I want to tell it to you now. A piece of armour, because I trust you. A glint of falling steel, because I feel safe with you.”“Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt.”“I want to know everything about you, Iris. I want to know your hopes and your dreams. I want to know what irritates you and what makes you smile and what makes you laugh and what you long for most in this world.”“He began to see the invisible threads that drew him to Iris. It didn\'t feel like fate; Roman didn\'t quite believe in such fancies. But it certainly felt like something. Something that was now stealing his sleep and making his chest ache with each breath”“Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you — a shadow you carry in your soul — but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again, as impossible as that may sound”'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""What the hell are you doing here, Kitt?""she demanded, shoving his chest.""Have you lost your mind?""She felt his hands slide down her back, resting on the curve of her hips. If she wasn\'t so exhausted and stiff from the harrowing encounter they had miraculously survived, she would have knocked away his touch. She would have slapped him.

The sweet romance? The story? Was it the fact that, despite not being part of the age group this was targeted at, I saw myself in both the main characters and could relate to their personal arc, both individually and as a couple?I have no idea, but if I had to try a guess, I\'d say it\'s simply a combination of all these things, plus the fact that Rebecca Ross is a crazy talented author.I\'ve had the chance to discover her just recently, after reading a book that\'d been on my tbr since 2017, and I\'m glad to conclude she\'s gotten even better with time and experience.Divine Rivals is abook I recommend going into blindly and one I definitely can\'t see anyone savoring slowly. Once you get into it, stopping is as hard as breathing under water.Rooting for the main characters to find themselves will become a new hobby, but rooting for them to find happiness by finding each other, will become an obsession.The progression from rivals to lovers is so smooth, almost soothing in its naturality.The setting is atmospheric, described so perfectly you can almost smell the stinging scent of gunpowder, hear the crinkle of the paper and the click of Iris and Roman\'s writing machine\'s keys.I don\'t know why, but while reading it, I couldn\'t stop thinking of one of my favorite movies,Un long dimanche de fiançailles. They have really similar vibes and not because they both take place during a war and tell the story of two very unfortunate lovers, but also because of the gray-ish undertones, the raw portrayal of reality, and the bittersweet romance.I like to consider myself pretty experienced when it comes to the reading scene, but those last pages made me feel like I was on a literal rollercoaster, even though I kind of saw it all coming.I didn\'t expect the pain to be so powerful, probably. It wasn\'t until the end that I realized just how invested I am in the magical realism of this story and the delicious pain that comes with this romance.Speaking of romance. I\'m at a loss of words for how perfect it plainly was.These two simply can\'t not be together. THEY CAN\'T.Roman is adorable, a real gentleman and the most cinnamon roll to ever roll, but for me, Iris stole the show.

You are worthy to feel joy right now, even in the darkness. And just in case you’re wondering… I’m not going anywhere, unless you tell me to leave, and even then, we might need to negotiate.”I honestly didn\'t know what to expect going into this book. I went into it knowing that it is listed as a YA fantasy but didn\'t expect to fall in love with it this much! I had seen so many good things about this, but the reviews just don\'t do it justice. This has become one of my favorite reads for this year!Divine Rivals is the first book in the Letters of Enchantment duet. This is my first book by Rebecca Ross, and I fell in love with it from the very first word, which surprised me since I usually don\'t enjoy third person. Her writing is so beautiful and poetic that it just captured me. Though this is a fantasy, there are some missing pieces to the world building, but as I was reading, I completely overlooked it due to the romance that was present. It\'s a slow burn, work place academic rivals to lovers, where he falls first and harder this always makes me swoon so hard, romantacy that is emotional with angst, tension, grief, death and so much pain that I hadn\'t been expecting.Iris Winnow and Roman Kitt are two young rival journalists. They work at the same newspaper the Oath Gazette and find themselves competing for the same columnist position. While the rivalry between them grows, so does a war that is between the two gods, Dacre and Enva. The two find solace within each other through two magical typewrites that are linked through their letters. Iris begins sharing her daily thoughts and her deepest griefs, and he does in return.""Sometimes I’m afraid to love other people. Everyone I care about eventually leaves me, whether it’s death or war or simply because they don’t want me.""""I realize that people are just people, and they carry their own set of fears, dreams, desires, pains, and mistakes. I can’t expect someone else to make me feel complete; I must find it on my own.""Iris Winnowis so strong, brave, and just precious and needs to be protected at all costs. I absolutely adore this woman. She\'s so mature for her young age and has so much to deal with in her everyday struggles, but she doesn\'t let it affect the way she carries herself and cares for others. I was so happy that she found her own family since all the people she\'s loved have left her in one way or another.\xa0 I just want to wrap my arms around her and give her the biggest hug.""But just in case you were wondering… I’ll gladly read whatever you write.""“You mentioned the other day that you think I’m only here to ‘outshine’ you. But that’s the furthest thing from the truth. I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war- torn land to be with you, Iris.”Roman C. Kittis grumpy and stubborn in the beginning, but when the layers start to peel back and we are left with the sweetest, kindest, gentleman that I swear you will ever meet. He had me absolutely swooning. His life seems so perfect from the outside, but he has so many struggles that make me love him even more. I won\'t go into detail as I want you to fall in love with him as I did. He goes through great lengths for Iris to show how much she means to him and cares for her. I mean, he stands outside her door and waits for her to lock it before he leaves. He raises the bar for real men, and I\'ve just added a new book boyfriend to the long list.""He didn’t want to live in a world without her and her words.""""She couldn’t bear to live in a world without him.""""“I think you and I are simply better together, Kitt,”""Their names would be entwined—Roman and Iris or Winnow and Kitt because could you truly have one without the other?""RomanIrisare the definition of soulmates. Their chemistry is so palpable from the very beginning, even as they were still rivals. Iris gave Roman the following nicknames Roman Cheeky Kitt. Roman Cantankerous Kitt. Roman Conceited Kitt and I loved them all. They had me giggling and kicking my feet. The way that he would do anything for her and the love he has for her words had me on my knees swooning. Their love for each other was felt through every moment on the pages. And the letters they wrote to each other are everything and so much more! They were making up some of my favorite parts. I need someone to write me love letters NOW!Side charactersI absolutely adored the love and found family that Marisol, Attie, and Keegan shared with Iris. They are the family that Iris never knew she would need. The way that they became close knit so quickly and will always look out for and do anything for one another is so precious. Now Iris\' mother Aster and her brother Forest I\'m not sure how I feel about them. They both did things that I couldn\'t fully agree with. I\'m hoping for some redemption from Forest for what he did in the next book.""It’s odd, how quickly life can change, isn’t it? How one little thing like typing a letter can open a door you never saw. A transcendent connection. A divine threshold.""That cliffhanger has me feeling so much.

I prefer sunsets over sunrises, but only because I love to watch the constellations begin to burn. My favorite season is autumn, because my mum and I both believed that’s the only time when magic can be tasted in the air. I am a devout tea lover and can drink my weight in it.”“I have the worst sweet tooth imaginable,” Roman began. “I prefer sunrises, but only because I like the possibilities a new dawn brings. My favorite season is spring, because baseball returns. I prefer coffee, although I’ll drink whatever is placed in front of me.”""It’s not a crime to feel joy, even when things seem hopeless. Iris, look at me. You deserve all the happiness in the world. And I intend to see that you have it.”“I think we all wear armor.

I mean how could I not whenRebecca\'s writing is this beautiful and exquisitethat I have no words to describe it. She just became one of my favourite authors with this book only. I loved the wayRebecca dealt with heavy topics like grief, loss of loved ones to war, healing and everything.The characters were well written that I could feel every emotion they felt.The connection between the main characters and side characterswas amazing.

That fire in her eyes could have brought him to his knees.”The fantasy and the world building about the gods in their world was a bit underdeveloped.It was more about people and their fears related to war and how they fought and survived. Their world divided in two parts- Dacre\' s followers and those who were called upon by the goddess Enva to fight her wars. There was a little story mentioned about Dacre and Enva\'s feud and also the other gods but I wanted to know more about Dacre and Enva\'s story and exactly what happened between them that led to this war. And I still don\'t understand that why Enva was not their fighting in the war like Dacre was doing that. But I\'m also hoping we get all the answers in the sequel.➸ Iris WinnowI love this girl.She is so archer coded 🏹I loved reading her povs the most and as much as her inner monologues were painful they were also so damn relatable. She\'s been through the worst but I admire her for her strength, her kindness and resilience. She\'s just 18 but she\'s so mature and brave and I liked we saw her growth throughout the book. I saw her struggles and how she grew out of them and always found a way to be there for others and her family. I was also happy that she now has her own found family.

He is such a sweetheart and perfect in every way. He was a bit grumpy in the start but that was also hot.He\'s just 19 and well mannered and he waited for Iris to lock her door.I mean no real man would ever do this and its the basic thing everyone should know about. He is intelligent, charming and also witty. Where do I find him because I wanna marry him!! The way he fell for Iris and then took care for her whenever he could and the way he shared his story and his secrets with her even though he was a bit reticent to share them at first. I loved it.“Your letters have been a light for me to follow. Your words? A sublime feast that fed me on days when I was starving. I love you, Iris.”╰┈➤ Their relationshipThey had been working and competing against each other for the same position but they always had this spark between them and this undeniable chemistry.The rivals to lovers wasn\'t there muchbecause they were already attracted towards each other but I loved that they still bickered and bantered even after felling in love with each other. Roman brings out the fire in Iris and he protected her with his life everytime.“Going easy on me, then?” He arched a brow. “That’s surprising. We’re supposed to duel to the death.”“Has anyone ever told you that you squint when you lie?” His scowl only deepened.“No, but only because no one has spent as much time looking at me as you do, Winnow.”The letters they shared, the secrets and pain they wrote about in those letters, the way they let their armor fall one by one to be vulnerable with each other, the way they earned each others\' trust, the way Roman followed her to the war sight to be with her, their morning runs, the way they fell in love with each other, the way their loved grew stronger and stronger everyday. It was just mesmerisingly beautiful.They truly are ✨️SOULMATES✨️“I broke my engagement, quit my job, and traveled six hundred kilometers into war-torn land to be with you, Iris.”Their love was just so sweet and wholesome and aching and even the war couldn\'t taint it.Did everything between them was rushed after they fell in love?Yes.Did I mind it?Absolutely Not.Because it was war time and they didn\'t even knew if they had a chance to see each other next morning, so they did what they could do and it was perfect and reasonable. They can\'t just wait for the war to be over or be adults in their early 20s to get married when they already saw the brutal reality of war and what it could do to people.“You and I … we need to stay together. We’re better this way.”“I am coming to love him, in two different ways. Face to face, and word to word.”The ending completely shattered my heart in pieces.Why would Rebecca did this to me. They just found their happiness after so much pain and trauma and Rebecca just ripped it away from them and left them with so many regrets and pain. Iris couldn\'t even tell him how much she loved him and that asshole brother of her didn\'t even tried to save Roman?? I hate Forest and I don\'t believe a word he said and Rebecca better give us a happy ending for them in book 2 or I\'ll riot 🤺— Some other beautiful quotes —➸ “It takes courage to let down your armor, to welcome people to see you as you are. Sometimes I feel the same as you: I can’t risk having people behold me as I truly am. But there’s also a small voice in the back of my mind, a voice that tells me, “You will miss so much by being so guarded.”➸ “I am so afraid. And yet how I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.”➸ “There are good days and there are difficult days. Your grief will never fully fade; it will always be with you— a shadow you carry in your soul— but it will become fainter as your life becomes brighter. You will learn to live outside of it again , as impossible as that may sound.”➸ “I don’t want to wake up when I’m seventy-four only to realize I haven’t lived.”➸ “Kissing him in the dark was entirely different from kissing him in the light.

I went into this book without really knowing what it was about, other than that it\'s a YA fantasy and super popular. What I wasn\'t expecting was howbeautifullywell written this book is. This book made me feel like I was wrapped in a warm blanket and Rebecca Ross\'s words gave me a big hug the whole time.To me, the concept of this book felt like it was a mix ofThe Hating Game, Beach Read and the Book Thiefwith elements of a dystopian fantasy.★The plot★This book follows Iris and Kitt who are both reporters working together and competing for the position of columnist at a newspaper called the Oath Gazette. This book is set in a historical period and a war between the gods Dacre and Enva is escalating and getting close to their homes in Oath. Iris is less fortunate and is experiencing hardship while Kitt initially appears to be a well educated, high society pretty boy with a sense of entitlement. The twist? Both Iris and Kitt have magical typewriters that send letters to each other and Iris doesn\'t know who the recipient is.╰⪼ThoughtsI was tossing up giving this book between 4 and 5 stars. Overall, I think the plot was probably 4 stars. I found it incredibly interesting and a unique take on a fantasy book intertwined with a historical fiction/romance. For a fantasy book, some people might find the world building wasn\'t massively present but I personally didn’t think it needed to be as it wasn\'t the main focus of this book. This book was received exactly the way it was intended to and was so much more than just another fantasy or romance book. The writing was a masterpiece and pushed this book to 5 stars for me.I loved that Rebecca didn\'t try to overwhelm the characters with a heroism or saviour complex concerning the war like most fantasy books would have done. By making Iris and Kitt correspondents you experienced the war and its effects through a raw lens. This book speaks to larger social issues, the importance of appreciating what you have, processing grief and shows the characters strength and resilience. Most importantly, this book showcasesthe power of words.The letterswere my favourite part about this entire book, you just have to read them for yourself to appreciate this.★Iris Winnow★Iris Enchanting Winnow, Iris Ethereal Winnow, Iris Exquisite Winnow, Iris Elizabeth Winnow.Ohh Iris I just wanted to give her a big hug the whole time. This poor girl went through so much at just 18 years old and was so emotionally mature. She had a lot of insecurity and had a hard time believing anyone could love her or do something kind for her without thinking they were making fun of her. She was so strong and compartmentalised her feelings to help others and do what needed to be done without question but she also had the ability to be so open to Kitt about her struggles and feelings. Her vulnerability when she had every reason not to be was so refreshing.""I am so afraid. And yet I long to be vulnerable and brave when it comes to my own heart.""★Roman Kitt★Roman Condescending Kit, Roman Upperclass Kit, Roman Confounded Kit, Roman Competitive Kit, Roman Chaffing Kit, Roman Cheeky Kit, Roman Cantankerous Kit, Roman Conceited Kitt and Roman Carver Kit 😭💗Again, Kitt was so emotionally mature for a 19 year old. His upbringing might have looked better than Iris\'s on the outside but he was battling an internal war with himself over the grief of his sister\'s death and his father\'s suffocating expectations of him. I loved that he fell first and his initial actions just reiterated how much she meant to him - that her words were hisinvisible stringholding him together. I loved watching his facade slowly crumble around him throughout this book, it was written so well.He followed her to war 😭 and the best part? He didn\'t go to convince her to go home or to sideline her. He just went to be with her because he couldn\'t stand to be away from her. He understood the importance of what they were doing and despite the risks, he didn\'t want to take anything away from her, just support her.""Iris! Iris, it\'s me, Kitt.""(sobbing) 🥹🎶I kept listing tothis is me trying, invisible string and tis the damn seasonby Taylor Swift while reading this and they just fit so well for Kitt and Iris🎶QuotesI honestly could keep rambling on about this and it\'s starting to feel like an open love letter but I\'ll leave you some of my favourite quotes:➸ “I’m tired of having to rearrange my life after the people within it depart, as if I’m a puzzle and I’m now missing pieces and I will never feel that pure sense of completion again.”➸ ""An then when you nabbed the first assignment and I read your article...

Dragged to a treacherous magical land she knows about only from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not truly a beast, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled her world.At least, he’s not a beast all the time.As she adapts to her new home, her feelings for the faerie, Tamlin, transform from icy hostility into a fiery passion that burns through every lie she’s been told about the beautiful, dangerous world of the Fae. But something is not right in the faerie lands. An ancient, wicked shadow is growing, and Feyre must find a way to stop it, or doom Tamlin—and his world—forever.From bestselling author Sarah J. Maas comes a seductive, breathtaking book that blends romance, adventure, and faerie lore into an unforgettable read.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '(Note from 4/17/2023 So someone reported this for unmarked spoilers even tho I prefaced it lol so the spoilers will be marked where they are, even though they really aren\'t spoilers at all because they do not significantly affect the plot in any way but oh well. It\'s either do this or have the entire review hidden bc of spoilers)(Note from 2/21/2023 because I apparently have to spell it out: For those of you who don\'t read comments or check dates read, I read and reviewed this book in 2018. It has been about 5 years; as I have stated in a number of comments, I will not continue this series. In the intervening years since reading this, my feelings on the matter have not changed nor have I desired to continue. Please refrain from commenting about how I need to continue the series or that I did not understand the book. I receive too many of those comments and I\'m tired of replying the same thing over and over again. This review is for me first and foremost, not you. Please move on if you do not like my take.)Me to Sarah J Maas:""Do you lie awake at night to come up with all your witty replies for the following day?""Oh dear, this is awful.The WritingThe title of this book is stupid. It\'s stupid and flashy and unrelated to the actual content of the book. It\'s solely for the ~wow~ factor. The quotable line, ""I love you... Thorns and all"" is wholely ineffective because ""thorns"" had not been established as a motif and was only used in that context in that very scene, more than halfway through the book. The word ""thorn"" was only used a grand total of 9 times in this book. The original Beauty and the Beast story had established rose motifs—you can\'t borrow good writing, even for a retelling. That\'s just lazy.The writing itself was inconsistent and poorly done.I pushed and pulled, but the mud was too slick, and held fast.Are you aware of the definition of ""slick"", Sarah J Maas? I do not think it means what you think it means.Besides that, Amarantha\'s hair drastically changed color after about 90 pages:Her red-gold hairHer black hairWhich is it, Maas? It can\'t be both unless she has unmentioned magical hair dyeing abilities.The atmosphere and the opening chapter were excellent and I was intrigued by the idea that was offered me, but the actual book did not deliver at all.This next point is a spoiler, but because I am disgusted with Sarah J Maas for including this, I amnotgoing to mark it as such, since everyone should know what kind of morals this book is supporting before they read it especially when they are as filthy and vulgar as this was.The attemptedrapeof Feyre by Tamlin was brushed off as no more than a mere romantic, steamy encounter to further their lukewarm love story. The only conclusions I can logically draw from this are all rather victim blamey, tbh—she was warned several times to stay inside with the doors locked until dawn, but she leaves her room not once but twice before dawn because she ~wants to go to the party~ and then later, after she almost gets gang-raped and is saved and then creeped out by Rhysand the sociopath, she thinks she is totally safe to go eat a bunch of cookies because, well the drums stopped, so it\'s probably okay now, and then she getssexually assaultedby Tamlin, who wasstill high with lust magic.I was about to pass out when he grabbed me, so fast I didn\'t see anything until he had me pinned against the wall.""Let go,"" I said as evenly as I could.I [pushed] him away. He grabbed my hands again and bit my neck. I cried out as his teeth clamped onto the tender spot where my neck met my shoulder. I couldn\'t move—I couldn\'t think.Before, during and after theattack, she\'s thinking,Wow, he\'s really hot. I\'m kinda uncomfortable with this, but I guess it\'s okay that he\'s drunk on lust magic, because I wanted to sleep with him anyway. That is avery wrong and dangerous way of thinking.No matter what, it isneverokay foranyoneto make someone else sexually uncomfortable or afraid, especially when they\'ve given verbal disapproval. This entire scene left a bad taste in my mouth.And then there\'s Rhysand\'s behavior. He repeatedly violates her personal space and comfort, drugging her and forcing her to""dance""for him in front of a large crowd for weeks on end after stripping her all but naked. Like all Fae males, apparently, he uses brute force to get her to comply with his sexual wishes.""But he didn\'t actually touch her; he kept his hands just on her waist!"" you say. Yeah, but did she say he could touch her at all? Did she actively encourage him to touch her? No, she did not.I pulled away, but his hands were like shackles.I would not have such an issue with this if Sarah J Maas didn\'t give the impression that she supports such behavior. That is what I find unconscionable.Besides that, the plot made no sense, even after exposition-Alis gave us the lowdown—in fact, it almost madelesssense then. It was cheesy and cliché and frankly, boring. The ""riddle"" was extremely easy and only proved that Feyre is an absolute idiot with no logical abilities, as I was able to figure it out before Amarantha had even finished saying it, and I\'m notoriously bad at riddles.The sex scenes were almost Empire of Storms levels of bad, cringey, and gross. I think Sarah J Maas doesn\'t know what YA means and isn\'t aware she\'s actually writing for NA.The WorldbuildingThe Fae were, for one thing, almost exactly the same (primarily in appearance and personality) to the ones in the Throne of Glass series, and tbh I was disappointed. They\'re not even cleverly unique faeries. They\'re just Tolkien-esque elves that are actually vampires: fangs and biting, immortality, aetherial beauty, animalistic tendencies, superiority complex. They don\'t have any distinct differences from humans in their thought processes or emotional capacities—only the same degree of variety that exists in humans.The religious system and creation story was very interesting and I really liked that aspect.The CharactersFaerie aka Belle: Sarah J Maas decided to try something new and have a first-person fixed perspective, but it didn\'t really work, because Feyre was a bland complacent character without much substance passed the surface level, and most of the interesting action took place where she couldn\'t see it. She suffered, like Celaena did in Crown of Midnight, from what I call Nehemia syndrome: the character that the MC has grown to trust, despite obvious suspicious behavior, turns out to be manipulative, and yet the MC completely overlooks that fact in favor of idolization of their lying friend. In this case, everyone in Prythian is keeping secrets from her and after almost getting her questions answered by the Suriel, Feyre decides to ""Stay with the High Lord. He will keep you safe,"" and just completely forgets that she wants answers about the blight. Also, whereas Belle left the Beast in the original story because her father was in mortal danger, in this book, Feyre leaves becauseTamlin impies that she\'s gonna get ganked by Rhys or Amarantha, the evil Faerie Queen.She is not an active protagonist. Also, her painting skills aren\'t a part of her characterization; it just feels tacked on to make her ~cool~ and ~unique~Tampon aka the Beast: I don\'t even care about this guy tbh. He\'s a confusing character who just feels like a Chaol-Rowan merge on steroids. He\'s violent, obsessive, and abusive, but also sweet, understanding, and caring, because that\'s not a contradiction. There\'s a difference between a complex character and a poorly written character.Lucien aka Lumiere/Cogsworth (his steampunk eye suggests Cogsworth but his personality suggests Lumiere): So apparently he ""hates"" Feyre even though I almost shipped them more since they consistently had better chemistry than her and Tammy, and that\'s saying a lot, because they didn\'t have chemistry.exposition-Alis aka Mrs Potts: She was okay. Just okay. She was fine.Reese\'s Cups aka also the Beast and kinda Gaston too: Is he supposed to be her love interest for the rest of the series or something, because the fan art definitely suggests that, but, uh, did everyone forget that he\'s a dangeroussociopathwith a history of violence?? He has no regard for her emotional well-being and sees her body as literally nothing beyond a sexual plaything. He\'s a horrible person.Amarantha: Why did there have to be a ""big bad evil Faerie Queen"" in this at all? There\'s already one in the Throne of Glass series and I can only take so much female-against-female hate from a supposedly feminist fantasy writer. Amarantha was bland and predictable, and her motivations were extremely surface-level.Her fam: Nesta was like, supposed to have some kind of implied character arc but lol it wasn\'t very good. Elain was nice and I liked her. The dad was okay, I guess. Pretty forgettable tbhIsaac Hale aka fake-out Gaston: This character wasn\'t important at all, but I just wanted to say that I think this is the dumbest name choice in a high fantasy book that I\'ve ever seen.Isaac Hale?? Really, Sarah J Maas? Really? That\'s the Jason of fantasy names. This is a the-guy-who-went-to-high-school-with-my-older-sister kind of name. It\'s not a fantasy name.ConclusionWhile I managed to read it fairly quickly, I had to dnf it for several days before deciding to trudge through. It was horrendous. I may pick up the sequel at some point, idk, but for now, from what I predict and understand from various spoilers I\'ve encountered on the internet, I don\'t really care about this series very much. Frankly, it\'s not good.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""That was both horrible and incredible at the same time, and my thoughts are a whirlwind.Note: The first part of this review is spoiler-free, but the second half is most definitely not. The spoilery section is blocked off by siren emojis (🚨). Skip to the end for bonus content, including an ACOTAR rap written by yours truly.This is the story of a mortal girl, Feyre, who kills a Fae in the woods one day. She’s whisked away to Prythian, home of the Fae, where she will live the rest of her days as punishment for murdering the wolf.Whoever said this was a Beauty and the Beast retelling is clearly not okay. This is far from a retelling, becauseit takes all the important themes outand leaves just the bare plotline:1. The Beast (Tamlin) is not ugly or even a beast at all. He just has a mask stuck to his face forever as part of a curse that I will get into more in the spoilery section.2. We are not aware of any good reason for Tamlin to keep Feyre until the very end, and it’s still a flimsy reason (this relates back to the curse).The problem with the plot is that the foreshadowing is so faint. The plot in the beginning and up until the 75 percent mark makes no sense at all. Tamlin takes Feyre to live in luxury, with good food and nice clothes and freedom, because she killed his fellow Fae? It’s just nonsensical.How is that a punishment at all?She no longer has to care for her spoiled sisters, she’s away from the poor village.However, it does make sense in the end, but Feyre is very naive for believing all of this. Something doesn’t add up. People who DNF this book will be very confused indeed.In Beauty and the Beast, we know of the curse beforehand, so we can find a good reason for the Beast to be kind to Belle. But Tamlin? It’s a mystery.So anyway, Feyre gets taken to a land of luxury to live out the rest of her days in comfort as “punishment,” but she’s still not happy because for some reason she misses her sisters, even though they treated her like dirt.She falls in love with Tamlin, which was expected because he’s not a Beast. There’s no barrier to overcome here.She isn’t forced to look past his ugly exterior because he has no ugly exterior.Along the way, another Fae named Lucien conveniently reveals everything Feyre needs to know right before it happens. This is supposed to be foreshadowing? I think? But in the end, he makes things so easy for Feyre and there’s no conflict whatsoever.The only problems arise from Feyre’s own stupidity.Their exchanges basically go like this:Lucien: The Suriel are super dangerous and even hard for the Fae to trap so stay away.Feyre: *makes simple snare* *kills chicken* oOpS I caught one, what a coincidence!!Everything is far too easy for Feyre.She’s supposed to be a responsible hunter, but instead she makes stupid, reckless decisions that don’t line up with her character. She follows an illusion of her father despite being told it’s fake, she goes outside on Fire Night, she chases the Suriel, she goes after Tamlin… etc.If you tell her not to do something, she will do it.Lucien: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Tamlin: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Literally everyone ever: Stay in your room, it’s dangerous.Feyre: *gets a midnight snack*Feyre is trying to figure out the details of this blight that’s supposed to be taking over Prythian, but luckily for her, Lucien and Tamlin give everything away with no struggle whatsoever.The result is thatthe danger does not feel genuine.It feels like a cheesy way to add angst to the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin.Speaking of Tamlin, everyone hates him so much but he’s such a sweetheart. I know that he gets worse in ACOMAF, but there’s nothing wrong with him in this book. He may be a little bland, but he’s much better than Rhysand. More details in the spoilery section.And then we have the writing, which is just bad. “...” is used in every other sentence, the poor em dashes are abused, and Feyre’s bones bark. A lot. Like, every time she falls down, she describes her barking bones. And what’s up with the phrase “my bowels turned watery?” It’s used at least twice and I don’t like it at all. This is notShatter Me.🚨🚨🚨SPOILER ALERT🚨🚨🚨So, what’s up with Amarantha?I really do like her. She’s a compelling villain because she’s (somewhat) realistic. Sure, she tortures people for fun, but her backstory makes this seem (somewhat) reasonable. (Somewhat.)Basically, she kidnaps Tamlin and Feyre runs after them because she has no self-preservation instinct. She challenges Amarantha, and in return, she is given three trials. If she wins them all, she and Tamlin will be free and his powers will return. If she loses… well, Amarantha keeps saying that there wouldn’t be enough left of Feyre to burn.However, Amarantha gives her a different option. She could solve a riddle.This is when things go downhill. First of all, why would Amarantha bet all her power and might on a simple riddle? It’s not even that hard to solve. The riddle itself is bad. The rhyming pattern isn’t great. And worst of all, the answer?It’s love.The answer is love.How does this make sense? Amarantha is a brutal, sadistic villain, so why would she write such a cliche, cheesy riddle?She should have made it oddly specific so Feyre would never get it.Anyway, Feyre answers it correctly at the last minute, Amarantha loses all her power, and Tamlin kills her.It was far too easy.Moving onto Rhysand. I hate him with a burning passion. He’s a greasy, crusty, dusty, musty old man. I can’t believe Feysand is the endgame ship. I’m suing. This is ridiculous. I don’t understand how people love him. He’s abusive, uncomfy, and weird.People keep telling me that I will love Rhysand in ACOMAF and hate Tamlin. First of all, I highly doubt it.Second of all,if you have to rely on making one character a villain just to get people to like the other character, that’s bad writing.Finally, the curse is so specific and random. Tamlin has to fall in love with a mortal girl who hates the Fae so much that she killed one in cold blood, and he has to wear a mask, and she can't know it's a curse.🚨🚨🚨END OF SPOILERS🚨🚨🚨In conclusion: Feyre is an idiot, Tamlin is precious, and Rhysand deserves to rot in a hole.Also, I wrote a rap. It’s called *prim coughing fit*Feyre Darling.Slight spoilers for ACOMAF.Feyre DarlingBy SofiaI let out a breath I didn't realize I was holdingRhys's hair is black but Tam's is goldenWill my bones bark or will they meowCome along Suriel and sing with me nowMy name is FeyreFeyreAnd I'm a standard YA MCWhat stupid things will I do?

DNF at 30% because I just got fed up with things moving at a snail\'s pace and NOT MAKING SENSE AT ALL. This was one of the most uncompelling versions ofBeauty and the Beastthat I have ever read. The writing is nothing outstanding, there was nothing that moved me. I feltCruel Beautyamong other B&B retellings I\'ve read this year and last have done a far superior job at moving me emotionally.Look, I\'m sure by the end of the book, all the things tie together and everything\'s just dandy and things will make sense, and I\'d be like ""ooooooh, so that\'s why ____."" Me, I don\'t care. Ain\'t nobody got time for that. I have so many questions and I\'m just fed up. This is not a retelling of Beauty and the Beast. This is a book about a girl who gets to live an easy life with a guy who\'s implied to be a gorgeous Fae underneath his mask.The original story makes sense: here\'s roughly how it goes. Handsome prince is cursed to be ugly unless he gets a chick to fall for him. Flash forward, there\'s Belle\'s dad. Belle\'s dad wanders into Beast\'s castle and touches his stuff. Beast doesn\'t like the fact that Belle\'s dad touched his stuff. Beast is going to kill Belle\'s dad unless he gets Beast some pussy. Belle\'s valiantly steps in to save dad, Beast is as nice to her as much as a hairy ugly, self-conscious, socially ostracized monster can be. Belle is treated like a princess because Beast really, really fucking needs her to save him and his people before the curse runs out!There\'s a reason Belle is treated like the queen! Things make sense! They have to learn to trust one another. Things are slowly developed an built over time. There is a hideous beast who is scarred emotionally, and a beauty who needs to look past the exterior. There is a point. Not so with this book.Things are far, far too easy with this book.Now here\'s this version of Beauty and the Beast,a retelling that tries to be bad-ass and fails completely,from the little that I have read.There\'sFeyrewho has a pretty crappy life with an absentminded, worthless, spineless dad, and two of the most bitchy, ungrateful sisters in the entire world. She slaves for them, she hunts food for them, she works her ass off for them. Without her, their family would starve. They don\'t care. I feel some pity for her, but she acts like so much of a martyr that there\'s only so much I can take.While hunting one day, Feyre kills a wolf, well, surprise, surprise, that wolf turns out to be a Fae in disguise. In return for this kill, Feyre is taken by a wolf (who\'s a Fae in disguise) away from her family.“What is the payment the Treaty requires?”His eyes didn’t leave my face as he said, “A life for a life. Any unprovoked attacks on faerie-kind by humans are to be paid only by a human life in exchange.”A life for a life!Oh, no! Is she going to die?! That\'s what a life for a life means, right?WRONG. Feyre is taken off to magical Fairyland to live in luxury for the rest of her life while her family is taken care of back in their little village.“Some would say it’s unwise to insult a Fae in his home,” Tamlin ground out. “Some would say you should be grateful for me finding you before another one of my kind came to claim the debt, for sparing your life and then offering you the chance to live in comfort.”So what?!Why?!This makes no sense at all.Feyre kills one of their kind. A beloved brother.In exchange, there isabsolutely no punishment whatsoever. She gets to live in a fantastically fabulous castle, waited on by servants. She gets beautiful clothes and delicious food.Another useless answer. I dug into my breakfast, savoring each rich sip of tea, and she slipped into the bathing chamber. When I was done eating and bathing, I refused Alis’s offer and dressed myself in another exquisite tunic—this one of purple so deep it could have been black.Clearly there is some kind of a setup involving The Treaty, since there seems to be a lot of secrecy between the Fae...but wait, whatever information she wants, the Fae reveals...they\'re revealing their own weakness to Feyre, who is constantly plotting her own escape.It doesn\'t make any sense!“There is … a sickness in these lands. Across Prythian. There has been for almost fifty years now. It is why this house and these lands are so empty: most have left. The blight spreads slowly, but it has made magic act … strangely. My own powers are diminished due to it. These masks”—he tapped on his—“are the result of a surge of it that occurred during a masquerade forty-nine years ago. Even now, we can’t remove them.”Over and over and over,the Fae reveal their secrets to her, including one that might help her escape.“So there are faeries who will actually answer any question if you trap them?” Maybe they’d know how to free me from the Treaty’s terms.“Yes,” he said tightly. “The Suriel. But they’re old and wicked, and not worth the danger of going out to find them.And then pretty much the next chapter, she goes out AND IMMEDIATELY FINDS THESE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES. WHAT THE FUCK.I do not like it when things come so easily to a main character, and everything comes easily to Feyre. There is no consequence whatsoever to her actions. There is no punishment to her deed of killing. The Fae are supposed to hate her...it doesn\'t feel like it, because she is ""inconsequential."" In fact, they\'re more of her playmates than her wardens. The Fae seem to have no other things to do besides play with her and hunt with her.“My morning work was postponed,” he said. Indeed, his usual tunic was off, the baldric gone, and the sleeves of his white shirt had been rolled up to the elbows to reveal tanned forearms corded with muscle. “If you want a ride across the grounds—if you’re interested in your new … residence, I can take you.”And teach her how to read and write...because Feyre cannot read or write, an ironic twist to the Disney Belle\'s love for reading.“I could help you write to them, if that’s why you’re in here.”Feyre is irreverent, ungrateful and insulting to her wardens...in a way that gets her no punishment whatsoever.“Do you ever stop being such a prick?” I snapped back.Dead—really, truly, I should have been dead for that.But Lucien grinned at me. “Much better.”As I said, I\'m sure this book improves in the end, but from what I\'ve read, this book makes no sense, the writing is emotionless, the characters are flat, the main character unrealistic, and I do not care to continue.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""INITIAL REACTION: WILL UPDATE WITH REVIEW LATER BUT KNOW I LOVED THIS.

I started reading it as soon as it became available and the array of positive reviews from my friends and strangers alike made me feel sure I would love it. But I didn\'t. It is possible I expected all the wrong things fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, and maybe my review can prevent others from doing the same.Here\'s what I expected:an intricate fantasy world, supernatural politics and alliances, fast-paced action, a sensual romance - perhaps similar toCruel Beautyand otherBeauty and the Beastretellings, and a flawed but likable heroine.But this book is, if you ask me, nothing more or less thansoftcore erotica. Which is fine, if that\'s what you\'re looking for.I personally thought that the fantasy aspect felt like trimmings around a story that was all about a romance between Feyre (the narrator) and Tamlin (a High Lord of the Fae). There are some titillating scenes where Tamlin bites Feyre\'s neck and they have sex - undoubtedly the best bits of the book and I won\'t pretend I didn\'t feel a little hot under the collar myself. But the ""ancient wicked shadow"" promised in the blurb is only really a source of more romantic angst for Feyre and Tamlin.However, I *do* like a good romance as much as anyone, so there are other reasons this book didn\'t quite work for me. In order to express what I mean, I\'m going to compareA Court of Thorns and RosestoCruel Beauty, which is, in my opinion, a better book.In CB, I felt the chemistry between Nyx and Ignifex as soon as their loaded banter started to fill the pages. They were sexy together, Ignifex was an evil ruler (which was a real problem for their relationship) with blood-red eyes, and the supernatural part of the book was creepy, weird and completely unique. Despite enjoying the actual non-PG scenes inA Court of Thorns and Roses, I never felt any real chemistry between Feyre and Tamlin or any realistic challenge to their relationship.What makesBeauty and the Beastsuch a compelling romance?One that demands to be told over and over again in so many different ways? I\'ll tell you what it is: it\'s the obstacles, the challenges, the improbability...how can a young woman come to love an ugly beast?We ask.I\'ll prove it\'s possible!The author replies. That\'s why readers fall in love with the beast again and again, even when he is furry and has horns like the Disney version. I loved the Disney beast.And that badass fox in Robin Hood so it\'s possible I have issues.Tamlin is not a beast.“Even as he bit out the words, I couldn’t ignore the sheer male beauty of that strong jaw, the richness of his golden-tan skin.”Oh my, how could a poor young woman ever love a pretty-faced, golden-haired, completely not evil Fae prince? How weird.Maas is a good writer and the beginning - before Feyre is taken to the Fae world - made me believe a great book was on the way. When Maas writes action, she writes actionreallywell. But there was far too little of it in this book. It came in behind the descriptions of beautiful Fae men and the Fae palace.In short:It just wasn\'t nasty enough.In truth, this felt more like an extended Cinderella retelling than what it was supposed to be. A girl lives in poverty and looks after her rather annoying sisters until one day she is swept up by a prince who takes her to his beautiful palace (after about three chapters). I just find it hard to recommend this when I thinkCruel Beautyis similar and yet so much better.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""4.45/5 ⭐Full review on my Blog:The Dacian She-Wolf🐺This book’s mood song match –Fix You by Coldplaymum: *enters kitchen at 3 am* What the hell are you doing?me: *with a bowl of ice cream in one hand and ACOTAR in the other* I'm starting another SJM seriesmum: Hang on, I have a bottle of vodka here somewhere*And if this is not some relatable shit when facing Sarah J. Maas’s books then I don’t know what to tell you anymore. You puzzle me.So, there you go – another great universe erected by SJM just in front of our humble eyes. She is building her own fucking multiverse and we are here to witness the power of a goddess at work. I will make three sacrifices for that.This is, so far, for me, the best Beauty and the Beast reimagination.HER EXECUTION STYLE IS THE AIR TO MY LUNGS.And this one is not even the best of her works.“Magic – everything was magic, and it broke my heart.”Mainly, our action is happening at the Spring Court where our main character finds herself in front of a new intriguing life. Or at least as intriguing as a Court of flowery gardens can be.As I always say about SJM’s books,the characters are the ones who make the action. It’s like they are the very engine of a plot.I kind of likeFeyre. She definitely has her own personal issues, mainly because she is broken and lonely and desperate to beat her status. She is human and miserable, mainly because her family is horrible. Her whole family was created to look like the typical fairytale family – an absent coward of a father, an uninterested mother, a sister full of wicked hatred and another one caught up in her own world, sensitive and naïve. Until her sisters do something worthy of my affection, I ain’t changing my mind about them.Lucien(the Emissary of the Spring Court), I must say, I liked from the very beginning, but he somehow managed to grow on me. There was something likeable about him at first and he only proved that to me more as the action went on.Tamlin, the High Lord of the Spring Court, on the other hand, seemed a bit stiff the whole book, even though I sometimes appreciated the occasional softness of his heart.But full-on honesty now – thebestthing about this book, the one thing that made it 110% better wasRhysand. He won for this book a full star from me with all of his domineering prick moves. He played the bad boy role so good that my traitorous heart enjoyed him whole. I might have a problem but oh, what a perfect problem he is.“His voice was a lover’s purr that sent shivers through me, caressing every muscle and bone and nerve.”Sexy.Rhysand and Feyre certainly have a sort of total chemistry that it seems Feyre doesn’t have with Tamlin; not even after theysupposedlyfell in love with each other. I don’t buy that love for more than a second and by the end when everything seemed to try to make me believe their relationship I was still not convinced.I recognise fabulous chemistry when I see one and that ain’t it. Rhysand, you’d better act up, love, I have expectations. You’re more than just a cruel, beautiful ruffian, I know it.There’s a certain cruelty in this book, so very Maas. I sometimes feel like I’m reading the words of a psychopath, but then I remind myself how much Ienjoythis cruelty in these books and I temperate myself.That crazy wretch Amarantha is definitely the embodiment of cold murder and torture in this book and this is visible when it comes to how much her actions affect the other characters’ moods and movements. It’s terribly interesting though to see how terrified all of them can become when facing her.But by the end, there was this sliver of hope that lingered. And that broke the evil to pieces.“This wasn’t music to dance to – it was music to worship, music to feel in the gaps of my soul, to bring me to a place where there was no pain.”Even though I think this is not the best of SJM’s works, I still believe is so very good that just makes you want to know more. It leaves you craving. And in my humble opinion, that’s a bonus factor in books.All and all, my first step into the ACOTAR universe has been a success. More steps to come. Until I fall in love. Wholly and irrevocably.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I cannot remember ever being this conflicted over a book. There are parts of A Court of Thorns and Roses I really loved, but a lot of parts I really hated.I went into this book fully expecting to love it. Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairy tales, and I was interested to see how SJM made the story her own.First off, my biggest problem with this story was Feyre as a character. I have never been so irritated. Her character development and personality, for the most part, didn\'t make sense to me. She was the caretaker of her entire family for years, supposedly a hunter with a strong survival instinct. And yet, she proceeded to make the stupidest decisions and put herself in danger time and time again. I didn\'t get the sense that she did this out of bravery, but more out of stupidity. It didn\'t mesh with what her character was supposed to be. Examples of these idiotic choices:1. Repeatedly plotting to escape into a faerie land that she knew to be deadly, when she was asleep on the way to the manor and obviously wouldn\'t know her way back to the mortal lands2. Running after the illusion of her CRIPPLED father at NIGHT, when she has been told and witnessed how deceptive fae can be3. Trapping a Suriel with little more than a snare, in the deadly part of the forest, after she has been told, and AGAIN, SEEN how dangerous these creatures are4. Going to Fire Night after being told how dangerous it is, not leaving after being almost raped by 3 faeries, and then proceeding to leave her room AGAIN afterwards5. Drinking the faerie wine at the Solstice, even after Lucien of all people warned her not to6. Leaving the manor when the Suriel flat out TOLD her not to and that she would be safe with Tamlin, and deciding to not mention that to ANYONE before he forced her to leaveIn addition to all of these idiotic choices, she also is incredibly inconsistent. She\'ll go from hating Fae to sympathizing with them to loving them back to fearing them at the drop of a hat. These inconsistencies are probably the most irritating, as there are scenes that I absolutely adore with Feyre, but then she goes back to doing the next pain in the ass thing on the next page.I also found her relationship with Tamlin to be problematic. Yes, I do enjoy problematic things (especially ships from time to time) but there were a lot of things I couldn\'t excuse with them. Again, more inconsistencies in characters\' behavior. Tamlin\'s hot and cold behavior was eventually explained, but not until 70% of the way through the book. It was too little too late. Also,I found the Fire Night scene to be a problem for me. I do enjoy volatile relationships and bad boy characters. But only when we are told from the beginning that one of the characters is ""bad"". Tamlin we are led to believe is a saint, then he bites her and gets possessive, but all is forgiven the next morning. Because he\'s a ""nice guy."" No.The world building I found to be lackluster in a lot of ways. While I really enjoyed the wide variety of Fae creatures we got to see, I thought that a lot of the back story was revealed in a lazy way. Instead of having Feyre figure anything out for herself, important things are told to her through long monologues from a number of characters throughout the book. This happens numerous times.Additionally, few side characters have any development and most felt like blank slates. With that being said, the ones that were developed I adored. Lucien and Rhys saved the book for me in a lot of ways. I found them both to be complex and interesting characters.The last 10-15% of the book saved it for me. I found the plot to finally be interesting, and I found Feyre\'s decisions in those chapters to actually make sense. A lot of things were set up for future books that have me very intrigued, and I\'m looking forward to the rest of the series. Many things that I disliked in this book, may in fact be remedied due to some of the occurrences in this last small section of the book.Overall, I was disappointed by this first installment. While there were elements I really enjoyed, they didn\'t make up for the elements I didn\'t. I\'m hoping future installments will prove to be better.I will also be doing a full video review and spoiler-filled discussion on mychannelin the future if you want to know more of my thoughts.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""If you've ever wondered which literary world would be the best to live in, wonder no longer, cause there's aBookTube Videoto answer that!The Written Review:----------Update - 12/6/19ShouldI cross the insurmountable TBR? Or reread this series again?I think you know the answer----------Here's the original review:Feyre is huntingin the middle of the woods tokeep her useless starving family alive(Hunger Games, anyone?).A chance encounter with a wolf - who wasn't entirely a wolf - leaves Feyreon the wrong end of an ancient treaty.She is forced to go to the fairy realm to live out the remaining years of her human life -no friends, no family and no freedom.“Has anyone ever taken care of you?” he asked quietly.“No.” I’d long since stopped feeling sorry for myself about it.At first, she cannot think of anything but escape. Slowly (but surely), she is swept into the fairy realm -in its magic & intrigue, in its danger & hopelessness, and in its wonder & glory.“Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter, Dawn, Day, and Night,” it mused, as if I hadn’t even answered. “The seven Courts of Prythian, each ruled by a High Lord, all of them deadly in their own way. They are not merely powerful—they are Power.”Feyre lands in the Spring court - which is under amasquerade cursefor nearly fifty years.The court is being attacked by all manner of terrible creatures and there is ablight upon the land.This blight will soon cross to the human realm - threatening everyone Feyre holds dear.The first half sucksbut keep readingThere's no way around it. From page 1 to about 200, Feyre isannoying and obstinate.I nearly put this book down half a dozen times (it was like readingRed Queen).BUT, there was something about it that kept me interested.AND THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT.Because wow. Seriously wow.Midway through the book,things turned around magnificently.It was like a whole new book.Sarah J Maas is a devious little thing.Suddenly, all the plot holes, nonsensical actions of her fairy captors (Tamlin and Lucien) and Feyre's complete idiocy flipped on their heads.Everything makes sense now.I literally could not put this down.Though, and maybe it's just me, butthe Tamlin-Feyre arc felt a bit rushed/forced.Her constant love declarations really had me questioning their relationship. But then again, I had a friend who accidentally spilled the beans on that one.Without giving any spoilers, I sure hope book 2 does acomplete character shifton you-know-who (NOT voldemort) because I amnot pleasedwith the way the love interest was hinted at during the end of the book. (He's such a jerk!)Overall, I amamazedby how much effort Sarah J. Maas put into constructing this story. I'm this close || to rereading the book solely to better appreciate all those little clues that I must have passed over.So, if you pick this up and just aren't feeling it -keep reading- trust me.The Finer Books Club - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book recommended by a friendYouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Don't feel bad for one moment about doing what brings you joy.”I'm speechless. What am I supposed to say after this? Am I supposed to write a coherent review with vital points as to why this book WAS FUCKING AMAZING??? I CAN'T EVEN TALK RIGHT NOW I'M SPEECHLESS. I WANT THE SECOND BOOK IN MY HANDS BUT MY ORDER STILL HASN'T COME. I'M READY TO GO TO FUCKING ENGLAND MYSELF AND PURCHASE IT. KIDS I'M LITERALLY DYING HERE.The Beauty and the Beast-esque fantasy drama tells the story of Feyre, who finds herself entwined with faeries after unknowingly killing one. When the 19-year-old huntress kills a wolf in the woods, a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it. Dragged to a treacherous magical land she only knows about from legends, Feyre discovers that her captor is not an animal, but Tamlin, one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world. Feyre must find a way to stop it or doom Tamlin and his world forever.I'm not a fantasy fan. I love fantasy in film and tv but not in books. I picked up this book cause I wanted to use it for my thesis for uni (don't even ask) and now after I graduated I decided to give it a go. My favorite genres to read are historical fiction and contemporary, and fantasy falls on a very different category. But the fantasy in this book man... it gripped me tight and didn't let me go.First I started off this book a bit confused. The language confused me a bit, the terms, all the information. I'm reading books in English while my native language is Greek so fantasy fell a bit harsh on me. As I said, I'm not a fantasy fan, and with fantasy comes many weird words and shit like that. But I kept going and after a while I got used to everything and started to enjoy the plot and the characters. I enjoyed very much the factor that there weren't many characters in this book. I don't like when a book is crowded with characters, it doesn't give me the space to love them all. This book succeeded in making all the characters lovable for me... even Rhysand. I fucking love Rhysand man. Unexpected feelings happening.The worldSarah J. Maascreated is so rich and dark and gloomy but also happy and hopeful and full of light, I truly enjoyed reading about it. I always get bored, to be honest, with descriptions and politics of different worlds but this one excited me. Even the fucking politics were exciting. I want to delve more into this world wHEN MY FUCKING BOOK ARRIVES.Now to the juicy shit... the romance. Holy fucking shit. I ship these two so hard I can't even breathe. When he sent her away I wanted to scream! He gave her a good fucking and left her hanging. Why am I laughing at this? But honestly, the romance was amazing. At first, I felt like the entire book was only gonna be about the romance and I didn't quite enjoy that but after all the revelations and the twists in the plot, the romance was used wisely. And I didn't expect that, because I have heard lots of things about this book. And now we have Rhysand... this dark, handsome motherfucker who has a gloomy past. This will become a triangle, I can feel it in my bones. But I'm here for it, for some reason. I love the heat Maas's romances convey in me.To sum it all up, this book took me a while to get into but it was all worth it. Maybe after this book I will start reading more fantasy. Maybe. Maybe not. As I'm waiting for the sequel to arrive, I will drawn my sorrow into crying about how amazing this first book was. Or maybe reread some parts. Maybe. Anyway, till the next one K BYE!!!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '2.5 StarsOnce again, I find myself the odd man out when it comes to a massively popular book...I went into this really excited and andreallywanting to love this thing.After seeing this book and its successors paint my feed with its courts and thorns and wings and ruin, I knew there was a lot of hype surrounding this series in general.And this first installment just didn\'t live up to it for me, sadly.There, there, Court Thornians...Quite frankly, the first 60% of this book dragged like a U-Haul trailer with no wheels.Nothing really happened and the things that did didn\'t even make sense until after the book was over.And I\'m just not a fan of that. I like to enjoy bookswhileI\'m reading them, not only for the last 25-35% when everything that was murky throughout the whole book becomes clear.I also found myself WAY more interested in Rhysand than the actual love interest, Tamlin.

Despite not being a fan of the superfluous writing style or the lackluster world-building, I was still willing to rate it 3 stars by viewing it as an easy guilty pleasure romance book. The relationship seems harmless and I still don't see how it's as problematic as people dramatize it to be. The first half of the book is a standard Beauty and the Beast retelling — not awful, but not special either — and then the second half really dips in quality, which lowered my rating to 2 stars.A couple glaring issues that stood out to me:1) The background story of the curse is literally told instead of shown via a side character's lengthy monologue. This was disappointing since I was intrigued to find this out by piecing clues together, not by being told it straightforwardly like a regurgitated wikipedia article.2) The main character seems relatively smart but consistently has leaps of logic that are clearly there for the sake of plot. 9 out of 10 times she won't follow the advice of another character.3) The antagonist is SO cartoonish — like mustache-twirling cartoonish. She gives a bunch of arbitrary challenges and rules for no reason other than for the sake of stringing along a story. It feels like she's hosting a game show or some overly complex scavenger hunt. There's no reason why she'd bother setting up any of these superfluous rules. I think this is the worst antagonist I've ever read.I'm willing to overlook the writing style and bland romance, but once I got to the part where Feyre answers the riddle, I had to drop it down to 2 stars because it was so ridiculous and lazy. I've heard that the sequel is much better though, so I am willing to give it another try, just not any time soon haha.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'First read: May 2015Second read: May 2016Third read: April 2017Fourth read: February 2018Fifth read: June 2019 — I think this is my most read series alongside Harry Potter and Mistborn.Sixth reread: Feb 2021Seventh reread: September 2023Every reread of this book has somewhat differed but nothing too drastic. It’s still my least favourite in the series. There’s nostalgia involved since this was my first book by Sarah J Maas. I’ve become really familiar with these books now. Or maybe I should say attached.It’s a great Beauty and the Beast retelling. It’s a great setup for the books to come, especially where Feyre is concerned and her character development, which is where Maas excels at.I quite frankly hated how loyal Feyre was to her family, though it’s understandable. But it’s this level of loyalty without any concern for her own well-being that leads to her downfall. Her loyalty to Tamlin when it came to the events that happen towards the end of the book destroy her. It was uncomfortable to read and see Feyre come to this realisation herself.This seems to straddle the line of YA and NA fantasy, which is why I’m assuming the world-building feels so lacklustre, and at times, juvenile. Amarantha read like a spoiled child, though she’s the villain. I just didn’t care for the magic and world-building in this book because of how underdeveloped they felt.Thank the stars this improves leaps and bounds in the sequels.

He’s popular and well-adjusted, star of the school soccer team while she is lonely, proud, and intensely private. But when Connell comes to pick his mother up from her housekeeping job at Marianne’s house, a strange and indelible connection grows between the two teenagers - one they are determined to conceal.A year later, they’re both studying at Trinity College in Dublin. Marianne has found her feet in a new social world while Connell hangs at the sidelines, shy and uncertain. Throughout their years in college, Marianne and Connell circle one another, straying toward other people and possibilities but always magnetically, irresistibly drawn back together. Then, as she veers into self-destruction and he begins to search for meaning elsewhere, each must confront how far they are willing to go to save the other.Sally Rooney brings her brilliant psychological acuity and perfectly spare prose to a story that explores the subtleties of class, the electricity of first love, and the complex entanglements of family and friendship.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""“Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.”(see my instagram review:https://www.instagram.com/p/C2zr6VgLlVN/)The first time I read this, I rated it three stars. While this can be considered relatively high for me (don’t check my average rating, it will only bring despair to us both), it is approximately two stars lower than what I expected to rate this book.I adore Rooney’s prior novel, Conversations with Friends, to a degree that is almost disturbing. Or possibly just disturbing.But this one fell flat for me. In a way that was difficult, at the time, to put a finger on. While I encountered the same stellar, almost painful writing, and the same reading experience so all-encompassing that it felt like it changed something fundamental about me, while I loved the characters so much that my concern for their well-being stressed me out, I did not come away from this book in love.I put a finger on what the thing keeping me and this book away from eternal love and matrimony was.It’s because I was sad.The first time I read this, I was so wrapped up in the characters and their lives and my concern for them that I overlooked...everything else. To me this was the story of Connell and Marianne and nothing else, and while I adored them both I missed out on the multitude of nuances and themes and symbols at play. The treatment of privilege and wealth, the examination of capitalism through relationships, the look at what love and self-worth mean, the submission and sometimes humiliation that is love.This is a gorgeous book, and a beautifully written one, and the second read of this enthralled me so much I lived in the story for a week.For once, I’m at a loss for what else to say.Bottom line: I was wrong, okay!!! There’s a first time for everything.p.s. In the original review I say that I'll never reread this book. That wrongness counts as the same one.---------------------reread 2 updatesi am swiftly abandoning this reread because i'm not enjoying it and i'm scared.update: resuming in light of how soon sally rooney's next book is coming out. still scared.update to the update: this stays 4 stars!---------------------reread pre-reviewraising this from 3 to 4 stars upon reread, so guess i have to rewrite this review.oh, the twists and turns life takes.review to come / 4 stars---------------------reread 1 updatesmaybe someday i will be the kind of person who doesn't take every excuse to reread, but today is not that day---------original reviewWhen I finished this book, I didn’t even rate it. I couldn’t. I had no clue how to even approach such a thing.I still don’t.That’s because I loved reading every single word of this (because every single word of this was written by Sally Rooney), but I also, in a much more real way, did not enjoy at all.Conversations with Friends, which I five starred, reread just a few months after my first read, and have not stopped thinking about, is not an easy book to read. I adore it, but I did not enjoy every second of it.Far from it, actually. That book’s characters are part of my heart, but I didn’t necessarilylikethem. I felt intensely and deeply known by its story, and that process doesn’t necessarily feel like a walk in a park.Well, maybe it is. But on one of those days where when you first go outside the temperature is perfect in a long-sleeve shirt, but then you spend every minute outside growing slightly chillier to the point of discomfort. And you’re excited to see the park has little ice-cream carts, but then you realize the process of eating the ice cream ultimately won’t live up to your imagining of it, and you don’t really like ice cream all that much anyway.If that’s Conversations with Friends…Normal People is a walk in a park during a blizzard. Without a jacket. And to distract yourself you have an ongoing internal monologue that’s actually sort of brilliant, you’re in rare form, and that’s great and all but it’s not quite enough to distract from the fact that all of this seems pointless and rather painful.It really seems to me that Rooney abandoned the gorgeous, deep characterizations and slow-moving stories of Conversations in favor of making characters vessels for themes.And I’ve simply never been that kind of a reader. I read FOR the characters, not around them.I didn’t much care for Connell and Marianne, nor their romance (if you can call it that). I couldn’t click with their arcs or their escapades or much of anything, besides Rooney’s writing. (Which was unchangedly amazing and possibly even better.)There were also some things about this that made me feel...icky. Sexual submission (specifically Marianne’s) is used as a metaphor here, and never kindly. This behavior of hers is presented as negative, usually, but it’s also inarguable that Marianne is submissive in her relationship with Connell, and that is never resolved. Connell feels unhappy several times over about the degree of her power over her, and while they return to their relationship contentedly towards the end, this is not at all resolved.I missed the lovely, tied-strings ending of Conversations.Conversations made me feel heard, made my heart and brain feel full, and Normal People made me feel...almost dumb. As if I was missing something that would have helped me put it all together, and without it of course it felt incomplete, silly, because I didn’t have the intellectual capacity to complete it.It’s possible this just isn’t the book I needed, when Conversations with Friends certainly was.It was still written by Sally Rooney, though.Bottom line: I will never reread this. Also I desperately need more Rooney.Update: I reread.---------------------pre-reviewi......cannot even rate this right now.review to come, when i regain the ability to think---------------------tbr reviewi want Sally Rooney to write my internal monologue""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Disclaimer: I understand thatNormal Peopleis very popular and much beloved. While I recognise that Rooney has talent, I foundNormal Peopleto be a mediocre read. If you dislike reading reviews expressing opinions different from your own, well, I suggest you skip this review. There are plenty of glowing reviews out there for this novel so there really is no need for you to waste your time leaving me a comment along the lines of \'you are wrong and here\'s why\'. Also, note that I wrote this review in 2018 and not recently.If you believe that characters who dislike themselves, shrug a lot, and say ""I don\'t know"" 24/7, are very deep and realistic, well this may be the perfect read for you.Or if you enjoy reading about ""in"" authors...look no further.If you are thinking about reading this novel, I suggest you listen toCrywank\'s \'Song for a Guilty Sadist\'instead, since it will take you less time and you will get the same story.At first I enjoyed Rooney\'s style, the way in which she juxtaposed ordinary moments with emotionally charged ones and the uncertainty that pervaded her story, but I soon found her style rather hollow and impersonal, in a manner that soon became predictable. There was a flatness to her voice that seemed affected, and gave her story an artificial quality. I had the impression that Rooney was trying to conjure a certain millennial ""vibe"" through her characters and their experiences, one that isn\'t all that effective or interesting.The central figures of her novel, Connell and Marianne, lacked depth and, as stupid as it might sound, character. Their looks were emphasised in a way that made them ""stand out"" from others: they are skinny and beautiful, they smoke, they make languid movements, they are smart, and unlike their peers they actually care about world politics. Throughout the course of this novel we are told howdifferentandspecialthey are, that\'s literally me type of characters.Marianne comes from a wealthy and abusive family (we are supposed to feel bad for her), Connell was raised by his mother and suffers from bouts of anxiety and depression (we are also supposed to feel bad for him). That they have issues that they can\'t cope with is realistic, but what I didn\'t appreciate is the romanticising of their difficulties. What I didn\'t like is that being ""alienated"" is synonym of ""cool"" and that seeking sadomasochistic relationships is understandable/inevitable if you come from an abusive family (i understand that this happens, and a lot of media manages to portray this reality, that of being a victim who either choose or fall into toxic relationship, or actively seek partners or friendships that emulate old patterns of abuse, with nuance, depth even. but rooney doesn\'t, for all her attempts at candid reality, her depiction of this struck me as sentimental and simplistic).Rooney handles serious issues (eg. an abusive family, depression, etc.) very badly (a book that handles trauma and self-harming incredibly well isWhat Red WasbyRosie Price), there we seewhythe characters behave in self-destructive ways, but in NP these things seemmerely props).Marianne and Connell aren\'t terrible people but god, they are so self-involved. Their relationship is made to appear fraught but I didn\'t always understand why. Drama for the sake of drama? They enter forgettable relationships with equally forgettable people but they remain fixated on each other.Why?No one knows...Marianne is depicted by the author and the other characters as being the sort of person who does not to care about others\' opinion of her but soon after a breakup with a cliched dick boyfriend she is obsessed with what people are saying about her...Connor is...intelligent? Indecisive? As interesting as a stale sandwich?!Secondary characters and family members are barely sketched out, they have little to no purpose other than creating more ""drama"" for the main characters. Marianne\'s family was so badly written that I had a hard time taking any of them seriously. Her brother is laughably cruel and her mother is uncaring and snobbish (they are rich so...). Friends from college serve very little purpose, other than making the main characters seem ""different"" and ""real"" (they are special, not like other people).What I disliked the most is that by the end neither Marianne or Connell show any sort of character growth/change. Not that I always want to read about characters who learn from their mistakes or gain some sort of insight from their experience, I can appreciate characters who keep perpetuating their \'bad\' behaviour or even those who get worse or regress into \'bad\' habits/behaviour, some of my favourite novels feature characters unable or unwilling to put an end to their self-sabotaging ways. But they have to be believable. Marianne or Connell were not. They were merely an \'aesthetic\', more befitting as subjects of a black and white grunge photo than anything else.The only reason why I finished this novel is that I listened to the audiobook and the narrator managed to make this otherwise unappetising storyline sort of okay.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Let it be known that I found this book both exhilarating and almost unbearably frustrating. About halfway through the book I literally lied down on my couch and screamed to my empty apartment, “Connell, you aresuchan incompetent communicator, I swear to God herself if you don’t help yourself I’m going to loathe every person named Connell I ever encounter for the rest of my life.” Even though I’m giving this book 2 stars, it’s more out of how invested I felt in the characters and how little I felt Sally Rooney capitalized on their potential, and not out boredom – I felt anything but bored reading this novel.I will start with what I liked aboutNormal Peoplebefore I continue roasting Connell. Now having read bothConversations with FriendsandNormal People, I find Rooney’s dialogue so, so sharp and entertaining. It’s witty and interesting and realistic, smart yet sincere enough so that it rarely feels pretentious. Some combination of how she writes dialogue and scenes is just so compelling, like I felt propelled to keep reading even when I felt tired of Connell and Marianne and their poor choices. Rooney also weaves in astute commentary about class and socioeconomic status. A few of the passages about class really made me pause and reflect on my own socioeconomic privilege, which I appreciate. At the same time, my best friend pointed out how ultimately Marianne and Connell’s whiteness both afford them the opportunity to be continually mediocre in ways that people of color are often not given, which I agree with.Which brings me to my main critique of this book: Connell and Marianne’s relationship felt so, so annoying and inhibiting. It honestly felt like reading an interpersonal train wreck that I could not look away from, even though I would have much rather looked at anything else (e.g., attractive actors like Steven Yeun, BlackPink music videos, the ceiling of my apartment, etc.) On one hand, I totally get and appreciate that people miscommunicate with one another and experiencing or working through miscommunications is part of life. But Connell and Marianne’s miscommunication literally drives the plot of this book for like, the first 200 pages, and even after that they never really have an explicit conversation about their communication and its indirectness? The majority of this book felt like: Marianne and Connell are intimate, then they have a miscommunication (probably caused by Connell), then they somehow reunite and are intimate again, but then they have another miscommunication (also probably Connell’s fault, like yes I get class factors into this but dang he’s a poor communicator), then they’re intimate, then they miscommunicate, etc. until the end.Finally, I felt like Marianne’s character had so much unexplored depth and potential. She goes through so much: abandonment, familial abuse, trauma and disordered eating, to name a few. Rooney did such a nice job showing some of the effects of her experiences on her psyche and view of relationships. Yet, instead of really going deeper into her struggles or her potential path to healing, Rooney dedicates the majority of the book to Marianne’s relationship with Connell, which I found almost insulting to Marianne’s character. I recognize I may be being a bit harsh here, on one hand I get that Marianne is desperate for some form of healthy connection as we all are to some extent, yet I so, so wish Rooney had given Marianne the chance to heal or develop more within the scope of the novel, so we could see that on the page and feel that hope for her. Instead, toward the very end of the book, Marianne essentially attributes all the goodness in her life to Connell, which made me blanch a little (while sitting on the same couch in which I cursed Connell’s name).Despite my 2-star rating of this novel and my 3-star rating ofConversations with Friends, I still feel somewhat compelled to try out whatever book Rooney publishes next, just because of the sheer addictiveness of her dialogue. There is some quality content inNormal People, about consent and power within sex, about mental health and help-seeking as well. I wish there had been more growth for these characters, outside of their relationship, especially for Marianne.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.This is going to be a polarizing book. I mean, IthinkI liked it. And I say ""liked it"" in the sense that it made me very miserable. It is a quiet character study, almost a YA novel but not quite, and it is aprofoundly lonely and depressing love story.I didn\'t begin by liking it.Normal Peoplefollows two characters - Marianne and Connell - through adolescence and into early adulthood, and they begin by being the kind of uber-precocious teenagers who read Proust and Marx for fun. It took a while for me to settle into their story. My initial impression was that this was going to be some kind ofJohn Greenfor adults, which is not something that floats my particular boat.Without fully realizing it though, this book had crept quietly under my skin. The relationship between Marianne and Connell is angsty, sure, but it felt painfully real. They are so flawed, marred by unlikable characteristics, and yet,I could not stop caring about them.Not for the first time Marianne thinks cruelty does not only hurt the victim, but the perpetrator also, and maybe more deeply and more permanently. You learn nothing very profound about yourself simply by being bullied; but by bullying someone else you learn something you can never forget.The story is really just about the two of them and their relationship. In high school, Marianne is a smart and wealthy girl, but is socially ostracized and emotionally abused at home, whereas Connell is working class, but very popular. Connell\'s mum works as a cleaner for Marianne\'s family. They begin a secret sexual relationship that falls apart when Connell fears his friends will find out. The compelling dynamic between them drives the story-- issues of class and social status cause much conflict.In college, the two meet again. This time, Marianne is popular, and Connell is feeling increasingly depressed. The two of them lean on each other time and again as they move through a social world filled with social expectations. There\'s a bit of aWhen Harry Met Sallyvibe, except that this book is more soul-destroying.Nothing had meant more to Rob than the approval of others; to be thought well of, to be a person of status. He would have betrayed any confidence, any kindness, for the promise of social acceptance.There\'s clear criticism of our constant need to impress and perform for others in a world that grows ever more connected. Much of the tragedy that befalls Marianne and Connell is caused by other people, peer pressure and social expectations. It is very sad to think that someone might give up who they love the most because they can\'t deal with how it makes them look to others.The pair\'s inability to adequately communicate is frustrating but feels realistic. I was on the verge of tearing my hair out at all the things left unsaid in this book, but I think it was a good kind of frustration. The kind that comes from caring too much.I feel like there are any number of reasons I could have hatedNormal People, but I didn’t. I actually kinda loved it. It\'s a weird, awkward, depressing novel about a connection formed between two very different people who find exactly what they need - and perhaps a lot that they don\'t - in each other.CW: sexual assault; domestic abuse; drug use; casual racism (called out); depression; anxiety; suicide & suicidal ideation.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""***NO SPOILERS***This is one of the most overrated books I've read in a long time, and I'mstunnedit was long-listed for the Women's prizeandthe Booker prize (but then, I usually dislike what's chosen for that). The critics are gushing over it too. A professional review I saw in “Book Page” calls it “wise and wondrous.” I ask this:How? How is Rooney’s message “wise”? Show me what’s “wondrous.” I’ve read wondrous and wise many times before. Those are the transportive books I never forget. They overwhelm me in the best way. Everything aboutNormal Peopleunderwhelmed me.Although Rooney’s simplistic prose makesNormal Peopleeasy to read, the book is poorly organized, overly sexual, plot-less, and ultimately never comes together in a satisfying way. Considering how ordinary, often boring, most people’s lives are, her book actuallyisabout “normal people,” but I expect authors to dress up the everyday. I expect tension, some drama, maybe a little suspense. I need a plot with a compelling reason for being. Normal people’s lives don’t make for good stories as they are; they require tinkering. A story about two friends-with-benefits who are confused about what they mean to each other isn’t a story. It’s merely the rough outline for a layered, more meaningful story.Rooney’s intention was a story about miscommunication between close friends as they grow and have various life experiences—except there is no miscommunication. The characters are clear about how they feel. They profess their love for each other more than once. They have sex all the time. They show each other care and consideration. What I saw was unexplainable hesitance. In high school Marianne is unpopular and rich; Connell is popular and poor, so early on this difference drives their hesitance and makes sense. I thought then thatNormal Peoplewas going to be an exploration of how class and social difference can harm a relationship, a kind of contemporaryRomeo and Juliet. Instead Rooney dropped this as soon as the characters move on to college, and their hesitance no longer makes sense.Where these characters’ class differences are concerned, development is shallow. Rooney didn’t illustrate how Marianne is unpopular and Connell popular or how Marianne is rich and Connell poor. She said that Marianne lives in a big house; she showed Connell’s housekeeper mother working for Marianne’s family a few times. That’s it, and Rooney could just as easily have made them the same level of popular and of the same class.I was continually confused about, or forgot, most of the secondary characters because none have distinguishing features or much, if anything, to do. Marianne’s mother isn’t shown, just talked about matter-of-factly a few times. A cruel brother pops up here and there to dole out cruelty, then disappears. A boyfriend is callous and doesn’t stick around long enough to do anything interesting. A sub-plot about abuse is mildly intriguing, but it’s also arbitrary and ends in a flash. They all tease, hinting atNormal People’s unrealized potential to be phenomenal.Of course normal people have lives that can change drastically and in unpredictable and sad ways, but translating that to the page necessitates a concrete story arc. I understand why some critics have called this book “stream-of-consciousness.” Rooney didn’t employ thatwriting technique, but the events, jumping as they do from one disconnected thing to the next, flashing backward and forward confusingly, are stream-of-consciousness in plot form. As a writing style, stream-of-consciousness is horrible, but in plot form it’s disastrous. I’ll give Rooney another try withConversations with Friendsbut with the lowest expectations.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Sally Rooney is the real dealNormal Peoplehas been lavished with praise from critics, longlisted for the Man Booker prize andadapted for television by the BBC. And that\'s just in its first week of publication!All that attention will, no doubt, attract quite a few readers who would not ordinarily touch this subject with a barge pole. Because this book:A)\tIs about young peopleB)\tIs a love story (but not a \'romance novel\')C)\tContains a fair bit of sex (which is crucial to the storytelling, btw, and is not graphic)All of which (possibly also the fact that the author is a 27-year-old woman) means thatNormal Peoplewill inevitably be dismissed by some as frivolous. It isn’t. This is a confident, accomplished and serious work.Of Rooney’s debut,Conversations with Friends, I said in my review it ‘occasionally scrapes close to the bone’. Well,Normal Peoplecuts to the core.Normal Peopleis not out to inspire, instruct, entertain or talk down to anyone, which makes it something of a refreshing anomaly in current fiction about young people. It is a novel (for anyone, young or old) that simply presents the truth of youthful experiences without the filters of nostalgia or sentimentality. It invites you to inhabit the psyche of someone else – two someone elses: Connell and Marianne – to identify with them and to feel their pain and turmoil. For the reader who connects to that, it is wracking.The story focuses only on the pivotal moments for these two characters, jumping forward three weeks, six months, or five minutes, as needed, to excise all the uneventful bits of life and leave us with the most emotionally intense supercut possible. It follows them from high school in a small town, through their years at university in Dublin, as the dynamic between them shifts with their surroundings and social circle. They’re not officially \'together\' the whole time, or even most of the time, but they always figure in each other’s lives in a significant way.Sally Rooney writes with such precision that this all feels painfully true. She conjures the tension and emotion in a scene just from the way someone wrings out a dish sponge; she conveys the full weight of feeling from a look or a shrug. In Rooney’s imagining, Connell and Marianne as separate entities are less important than the interplay between them – their relationship dynamic and the influence each of them has on shaping the other, that’s the real stuff of this book:""How strange to feel herself so completely under the control of another person, but also how ordinary. No one can be independent of other people completely, so why not give up the attempt, she thought, go running in the other direction, depend on people for everything, allow them to depend on you, why not.""There’s irony here, and self-conscious posturing (though not nearly as much as in CWF), but earnestness, truth and kindness as well. In addition to the central relationship are issues of class and intellectual integrity. It\'s a particularly astute look at the rebuild of self that teenagers undergo in the transition from school to uni, how it allows some to thrive while others stumble, and in some ways is just an illusion after all.So there’s hype and there’s backlash to the hype, andNormal Peopleis sure to resonate powerfully with some readers and not at all for others. If you like a minutely observed novel about people and feelings that isn’t mawkish, I\'d say give it a go.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""On the second page of Sally Rooney’s universally acclaimed, Booker- longlisted novel is the following paragraph:‘He puts his hands in his pockets and suppresses an irritable sigh, but suppresses it with an audible intake of breath, so that it still sounds like a sigh.’What?I get the hand in the pockets bit, but how the hell does the rest of it work? A sigh is an exhalation and I have no idea how any attempt to suppress a sigh by inhaling could possibly sound like one. I’ve tried hard to imagine it, but no luck. I’ve tried even harder to do it, but even less luck. In fact, in an effort to understand this twaddle I have tried it so often that I have come close on several occasions to hyperventilating and passing out.What have those Faber editors been doing? Maybe they have no problem with it because they are all so much cleverer than me and know how to read properly. Or maybe they also tried to do it and actually did pass out, which might explain why they have failed to apply the editorial pencil with any intelligence in the 264 pages that follow.The more likely explanation, of course, is that the problem is mine – and I offer the following gems from Normal People on that understanding…• ‘He looks down into his lap, and exhales quickly, almost like a cough’.It’s hyperventilation time again. I’ve imagined it and I’ve tried it, but I still don’t get it.• ‘He can’t even visually imagine himself as a lawyer, wearing a tie and so on..’Do we really need that ‘visually’?• ‘It’s true she is Connell’s type, maybe even the originary model of the type:’Originary? What does that mean? Am I the only one who had to look it up? (It’s not in Chambers, by the way, so you’ll need the OED)• ‘Peggy, watching, took a performatively large mouthful of Cointreau…’Can anyone explain what ‘performatively large’ actually means?• ‘Enraged now, Alan wrenched her back from the sink by her upper arm, and, seemingly spontaneously, spat at her.’Seemingly spontaneously?I could go on. It’s not often that I feel the need to read with a pencil in my hand but Normal People drove me to it, and my copy is now covered with question marks and annotations. I retired from teaching last year but reading Sally Rooney’s feted novel felt like I was marking again - in this case marking the work of a precocious, but overindulged, talent.In 'Normal People' alternating points of view are combined with an inconsistent and confusing authorial presence, voices are often difficult to differentiate in an ineffectual free indirect style, the comma splices (Ferrante this isn’t) and the unpunctuated dialogue, far from creating an impressionistic flow, suggest a lack of precision, and the prose shifts from past to present for no apparent reason and even within paragraphs, creating a chronological blur. In short, it's a bit of a mess.If I cared about the characters or cared about the story, these things would not matter quite so much but on the few occasions when I saw through the writerly mess I found it difficult to care about them at all.The novel, though, has been so well received that its very reception has become a news story. ‘Salinger for the Snapchat generation’: critics unite to praise 27 year-old novelist’ was the headline in last Saturday’s Guardian.So the problem is clearly mine.Maybe I've read a different book from the one everyone is raving about. Maybe I've read the same book but don't know how to read properly. Or it could be that I'm the child's voice at the back of the crowd politely suggesting that the emperor might not be wearing any clothes.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I am not sure how to write this review because I seem to be so far beyond the pale on my antipathy to this book. In simplest terms I didn\'t connect with this work at all and I would be best to chalk this up to a ""reader/writer"" mismatch and move on but I will try and articulate some of my reading experience.Some of my perplexity withNormal Peopleis that I just couldn\'t relate to the twenty something, highly educated, politically aware and cynical young adults that populate this novel. I am not sure how reflective these voices are of young Irish making their way in the world, but as presented here I found them exasperating to listen to and not particularly nuanced.It is possible that even if I didn\'t enjoy the novel I might like the writing but in actual fact Rooney\'s style is perhaps the single biggest thing that bugged me. I found some passages of interest sandwiched between a lot of wooden dialogue and these flat descriptions ...Marianne goes inside and comes back out again with another bottle of sparkling wine, and one bottle of red. Niall starts unwrapping the wire on the first bottle and Marianne hands Connell a corkscrew. Peggy starts clearing people\'s plates. Connell unpeels the foil from the top of a bottle as Jamie leans over and says something to Marianne. He sinks the screw into the cork and twists it downwards. Peggy takes his plate away and stacks it with the othersThis kind of writing really gives me nothing.Others have cited the two dimensional nature of her secondary characters and I would concur. Barely any of them made much of an impression on me. Alan - Marianne\'s brother, seemed particularly badly drawn. He appears to be a key part of understanding Marianne and yet he warrants only a few pen-strokes of unexplained malice and cruelty. The opening of a wine-bottle and pouring of cups of tea receives much more page space.I tried to understand Marianne, who seems to be both ugly and beautiful, popular and friendless. Her hinted at troubled family life was suppose to underpin her need to be a submissive. I remain unconvinced that this is really how dominance and submission works and I would think experts in BDSM might strongly take issue with some of the cliches here.The relationship between Marianne and Connell should have kept this book afloat at the very least. The intense emotional and physical connection, the will they / won\'t they stay together, all the drama of YA love is here but it is in an eye-wateringly navel-gazing form. I found it all exactingly po-faced. The number of inexplicable break-ups, largely based on mis-communication was about three or four break-ups too many for me. I just wanted to yell at this novel most of the time. Say what you mean and stop being so insufferably difficult !, either split up or stay together, both your friends and I really don\'t care !. Marianne and Connell were of most interest to me when they started emailing each other, discussing novels and politics thus preventing them breaking up over some new emotional minutiae. Perhaps this should have been a novel of their email exchanges.Oh well, I guess I will never be a Rooney fan and I have doubtless missed the point of this book entirely but that is ok not every book is for every reader.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Normal Peoplestarts out beautifully. Marianne is a loner in high school with no friends, while Connell is the popular football player. His mom works as a cleaner at Marianne's house, so they run into each other when he stops by to pick up his mom. Over time, they start to thaw around each other, growing closer as they realize that they can be their true selves when they are together.Rooney captures so well the vulnerability and awkwardness of teenage years, along with its exuberance and infinite possibility. It was sweet to follow along to Marianne and Cornell's developing relationship. Even though there is the stress of school and the pressure of being teenagers, when they are alone together, they can be free to express themselves and be who they really are.Then they are off to college, and the dynamics change. Marianne becomes the popular one, and Connell becomes the loner with no friends. At this point, I start to realize Rooney captures a very black and white version of high school and college. You are either part of the popular obnoxious crowd or you are a nobody with no friends, and there is nothing in between. And everyone's ultimate goal was to be in the popular crowd. But that isn't the school experience I remember, so it became harder and harder for me to connect with this book. In my experience, people had several different groups of friends, and no one liked obnoxious people. Most were working so hard that they didn't have time to worry about popularity and how others regarded them, especially in college.This story has a very YA feel to it, where the characters are filled with angst and lack emotional maturity. While that made sense when Marianne and Connell were in high school, as the story progressed through their college years, it didn't anymore. The two seem to love each other, and yet, they are so sensitive to perceived slights that innocent conversations would quickly escalate to a breakup. Honest communication would clear this up immediately, but they don't do that. Instead, they circle and prod each other until they are back together again. Then the cycle repeats. It's all very dramatic, but it left me pretty apathetic by the end of the book.This book also tackles the subject of abuse, but I think it was a missed opportunity here. Rooney portrays abuse as if some people just want to be abused, so they will let anyone abuse them, and even go around looking for it until they find it. That's not right. Victims have trouble escaping because abusers are often the people they love most, who treat them well most of the time and express regret after an incident. But there is no love or good treatment in this book, so it doesn't make sense that the victim would just put up with it.In the end, I thought the first half of this book was wonderful, but everything stagnated in the second half. The main characters never really grew up, so they repeated the same mistakes over and over again. Their lack of maturity and insight into themselves and their relationships grated on me.

Get ready to set your ugly cries free!!!!This really reminded me of those tear jerkers, Oh God I cannot breathe, all my happiness swept away by emotional vampires vacuum cleaners inc., come on, that’s kind of nerve bending story that one of the protagonist has to die from a deadly disease ( or both of them needed to die sometimes! Oh no another crying torrent coming up! I cannot hold it! I can’t)or one of them has to commit suicide kind of, depressive, sad, exhausting, giving you anxiety attacks kind of John Green books. (After looking for Alaska, I felt the a dark cloud always following me for one month and my husband fed me with soap and Chardonnay, as you can imagine I couldn’t eat solid food at least two months because I bit the pages of the book and chewed so hard, destroyed my dental implements!!!)So yes this book is sad, horrifyingly bringing your dark clouds and vultures above your head and interesting fact is nobody dies! But yes there are so many heavy, harsh, heart wrenching, brain cell boiling issues make you feel like hit by a truck several times, then suffered from waterboarding and torture conducted by American Psycho’s Patrick Bateman and finally thrown away into the swamp,eaten by crocodiles. The characters deal with drug addiction, bullying, sexual assault, suicidal thoughts, severe depression and it is really heartbreaking to see them not to have a regular teenager lives.And you know what after all those torturous feelings, my kindest part of soul( also my masochist brain cells and my vulnerable heart) loved those two characters, Connell and Marianne and witnessed their literally growing up, their adolescence and early adulthood times, forming friendship, special- sensitive bound. At first when they were in high school, Marianne is outcast, social pariah, bullied by mean girls as Connell is shiny, popular star of the school community. The part he didn’t take her to the prom was harsh, mean move and Connell lost his all his brownie points and earned slapping contest championship’s high rated asshole statue.But when they were in college, the balances were changed now Marianne is intellectual, independent, smart social queen and Connell loses his spotlight and sentenced to be an ordinary, invisible college boy which makes him more depressed and lonely.Their friends-lovers- again friends- again lovers kind of complex relationship and their story’s revelation should be called : “Restrained screams” or “Unsaid Words” , or “Bottled Up Emotions!” or “I think I’m really pissed off those two characters so much for breaking my heart !”I know the realistic conclusion was necessary, logical, reasonable but it doesn’t mean it is not hurting you so much!As a result, if you can deal with feeling blue by reading sad, sad, sad, OH GOD WHY THE HELL I CARED SO MUCH ABOUT THOSE CHARACTERS kind of book, this is just for you.I liked the captivating, realistic, poignant story telling and I truly accepted those broken, flawed, complex characters but I think sometimes their story made me suffocated a little.

Never have I read a young-adult romance book that feels so realistic to what happens in real life sometimes. It\'s not always boy meets girl and they live happily together with hardly any issues. This book has depth and complexity, which sometimes is lacking in romance books. The interactions and conversations that Rooney writes about feels so real and true. I loved how she touches on real issues that young adults experience as they enter a new era of life (college). While reading I kept wondering.. ""Will they even end up together?"" Both Connel and Marianne (the main characters) are exploring new intimate and sexual relationships outside of their own. This is a compelling modern love story, one that deserves all of the attention it gets.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I thought I’d do the Goodreads Summer Reading Challenge, even though it’s just about winter here in Sherwood. But I think I’ll get away with it, you never see any police around here from one year to the next. Anyway, standards really aren’t what they were, I don’t even think anyone would care. In the old days if you did a summer reading challenge in winter you’d be out the door so fast your feet wouldn’t touch the ground. But these days people have neck tattoos and name their children after brands of paint remover so you can get away with anything.When I looked at the categories of the reading challenge I had to ditch a couple – “Read a Goodreads Choice Winner” was one – I mean, sorry Goodreads, not to eat the hand that feeds you and all but those Choice Awards are not my cup of tea at all. Fortunately the other categories fit neatly on to several stubborn denizens of my real life to be read shelves, so off I go.The category I’m doing here is “Read a ‘most read’ book” so I consulted the list and I found a copy of one of these popular works in my local Oxfam, andNormal Peopleit is.NOT THAT NORMALThis turned out to be a kind of romance but at least it was the unromantic modern version, where we follow a couple from school (she’s rich and unpopular, he’s working class and beloved by all) to university (where it’s the other way round suddenly) and during this long peregrination they’re on-and-off shagging and loving and BFFing and pinging from one thing to the other like pinballs whilst at the same time recoiling in horror from acknowledging the plain fact that they’re made for each other, so they attempt and fail to have actual real boy/girlfriends and the real boy/girlfriends have no idea what’s really going on so this golden couple of Marianne and Connell have a permanent status of IT’S COMPLICATED.They have angst in their pangst.The short version of all that is to say thatNormal Peopleis the unfunny updated version ofWhen Harry Met Sallyor that it’s like if Ross and Rachel had absolutely no sense of humour or any charm at all and were all strictly gloomsville I-am-suffering because life is suffering, woe is us, woe is all of us.THE MASOCHISM TANGOIn the middle of this wall to wall fraughtness and gnashing of laptops we get to find out that the lovely Marianne has a masochistic streak. When she’s not with Connell she likes her boyfriends to beat her up.I think it’s now possible to construct a rough and ready scale of female masochism using novels I happen to have read or movies seen. Here are seven female protagonists rated out of ten on the masochism scaleAnastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey...………………………….3Eileen Dunlop in Eileen......................................................…….4Lee Holloway in Secretary...………………...…………………………...6Marianne Sheridan in Normal People...…………………………….7Nora in Topping from Below\t......……………………......…...……….8Erika Kohut in The Piano Teacher...……………………......………..9O in Story of O...…...…………………………...…………………………….10O is the gold standard of female masochism. I can’t see O ever being beaten.THE WATER FROM THE TAP GOT WARMERThe soundtrack toNormal PeopleI think would be a jarring mixture of Kraftwerk, Leonard Cohen and late Billie Holliday, when her voice was all hoarse and ruined. WhatNormal Peopledoes is to describe at length a hot mess of a relationship in cool, affectless sentences, some of which go way too far with their cool and affectlessnessThe outside door closes and Marianne re-enters the kitchen. She rinses her water glass and leaves it upside down on the draining board.Many pages laterThe water from the tap got warmer and Marianne put the plug in the sink and squeezed a little dish soap onto a sponge.And many pages laterMarianne drank a single cup of black coffee and ordered a croissant which she didn’t finish. Connell had a large ham-and-cheese omelette with two slices of buttered toast, and tea with milk in it.Meanwhile, our tall handsome working class star student Connell suffers from a book-length inarticulacy that is distressing to witness. He’s all “that was weird”, “I don’t know”, “I’ll have to think about it”, “Kind of” and “That was weird”.As regards the plot, there’s not much to see here, it’s really just beads on a string. One thing - I had a problem with Marianne’s family, only a mother and a brother, but they both seem to hate her, for reasons never explained. I mean, give us a hint, Sally. Just a little hint. But you know what, I read this in two big gulps, it was weirdly compelling, similar to another much beloved and not that great campus novelThe Secret History. So that’s something. I read many novels that I find extremely putdownable and unpickupable. This was not one of those.SO, DID YOU LIKE IT?It’s complicated.2.5 stars.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘Life offers up these moments of joy despite everything.’The directions our lives take are often shaped by those around us, particularly actions made out of love. Normal People, the second novel by the acclaimed writer Sally Rooney, is a moving narrative of the steps and missteps of young love as two people grow into themselves in a troubled world of class divide and social pressures. The book follows Connell and Marriane from their first days as secret lovers in high school through their tumultuous friendship--often sexual--at Trinity College, Dublin. Normal People is at its best when addressing the social issues of class, which she brilliantly uses sex as a medium to elaborate on the power dynamics and dehumanizations of capitalism. While there are a few problematic moments regarding Marianne’s preference towards submission that seems to disregard her autonomy in her own sexuality and assume that the preference is the hallmark of being “damaged”, Rooney manages to very accurately describe modern love in a way that expresses the complexities in all their untidy beauty, as well as the social posturing and emotions of college years. Through using sex as a navigational device across society and told in a sparse, matter-of-fact style that doesn’t impose an authorial judgement over the events in favor of acknowledging the reader’s ability in being able to decode for themselves, Normal People is a success that is nearly impossible to put down.Great news, Rooney more that lives up to the hype. The press releases marketed Irish writer Sally Rooney as the “first great millennial novelist”--a fairly eye-rolling label clearly intended to hit nerves and spark conversation in what also seems a constant attempt from the gatekeepers of older generations to minimize or infantilize the millennial generation--and her name has achieved pop-culture accolades recalling Elena Ferrante from a few years ago. Even Taylor Swift recently came out of the woods to recommend Rooney’s first novel,Conversations with Friends. Speaking of eye-rolling marketing, Conversations was hailed as the “Salinger of the Snapchat Generation,” which seems like something impossible to proclaim unironically. In all this misguided and lazy-label hype that seems half intent on wishing for her downfall, Rooney is an utter delight to read and Normal People is a wonderful achievement. If she is a ""Salinger of Snapchat""? That is up to you to decide (personally I hate that label too much to make a judgement call), but isNormal Peoplean original and insightful accomplishment? Definitely.Normal People begins with Connell and Marianne in high school as what seems like caricatures of themselves. If initially their characters feel a touch cliche, it is because we are all a bit of a cliche at that age. Connell is the smart, athletic type concerned how others think on him whereas Marianne is an outcast who is considered strange for daring to be an intellectual woman and not caring what others think of her (okay, maybe it is alittleoverly cliche, but bear with me here). After a secret relationship--Connell being concerned his friends will know they are sleeping together in a way that is outright abusive--they part ways only to reunite at Trinity College where now Connell is the quiet outsider and Marianne the center of attention. A turning of the tables he deserves as in high school he had a sense his social status made him too good for her and he deeply hurt her because of it as ‘his attraction to her felt terrifying, like an oncoming train, and he threw her under it’. The novel launches from here into many turnings-of-the-table, complicated friendships and near-misses, with each seemingly caught in each others gravity no matter what they do or who they are with.‘It\'s funny the decisions you make because you like someone, he says, and then your whole life is different. I think we\'re at that weird age where life can change a lot from small decisions.’It is truly moving seeing the ways a person’s trajectory in life can be so shaped by those around them. Being set at the start of this decade, the artifacts of the era--such as a scene discussing economic policy while listening to the first Vampire Weekend album--were deeply nostalgic for me and reminded me what life was like in the age of the characters. While some might decry them as overdramatic or bold representations of themselves, remembering who you were at the age of 19 and all the social posturing of that period is a good way to really appreciate how well Rooney captures the age frame of her characters. The social dynamics of a college campus are really well done. Marianne, for example, is honestly interested and invested in social justice and politics, but a girlfriend of Connell’s assumes her discussions about it at parties as a grab for attention. Connell, on the other hand, is very well read but doesn’t name drop books the way others do and is suspected of being uncultured and dumb by Marianne’s male make-a-show-of-being-cultured friends (you know the type: the guy that will tell you information about Ian Curtis without you asking, corrects someone’s pronunciation of Sarte, and casually leaves work-in-progress art lying around but acts annoyed if you comment on it, as a friend recently put it).He did gradually start to wonder why all their classroom discussions were so abstract and lacking in textual detail, and eventually he realised that most people were not actually doing the reading. They were coming into college every day to have heated debates about books they had not read.The society at the Uni is very much indicative of social class, Connell at one point telling his therapist he has actually witnessed students argue over which of their father’s make more money. Being a working class outsider, or a ‘culchie’ as the slang goes, he observes that many of the excessively rich students like the notoriety of intelligence more than actually having tobeintelligent.It was culture as class performance, literature fetishised for its ability to take educated people on false emotional journeys, so that they might afterwards feel superior to the uneducated people whose emotional journeys they liked to read about.It becomes an act of superiority to state you’ve read a book or have a stern opinion on a political topic, which, actually having a working knowledge of these and caring about them does give Marianne an easy “in” with this culture and luckily Rooney spares the reader an impression of C & M as authentic and the rest as Salinger “phoneys”. It’s implied, but handled well.While Rooney occasionally dips into caricatures of college-types for minor characters, her primary characters are nuanced and complex in a way that, by the end of the book, you feel you shared your time with real people. Both Marianne and Connell are problematic at times--especially Connell and his sexual hangups or his impressions of Marianne as “damaged”--but Rooney invests emotional insights into them that grants them a real sense of authenticity. Unlike the first person narration ofConversations,Normal Peopleis told from a very unaffected third-person omniscient perspective that refrains from making judgements on the characters. You see their faults and their inner-justifications or griefs but the reader is left on their own to decide what to make of them. There are times when either character will disgust or frustrate you, and others when you really feel for them. Like life, nothing caught in a social web is simple. As the novel progresses, so does the insight into their emotional well-being, which reaches a climax of sorts when Connell is having suicidal thoughts and Marianne feels insignificant in the world. Luckily, Rooney handles these topics with grace that captures the feelings of depression without glorifying them or using them merely as a plot device. Similarly is Marianne’s homelife, with a now-dead abusive father, an all-but-absent mother and a weak yet abusive older brother who takes out his anger on her. The way these elements shape a person is done quite well--aside from some of Rooney’s presentation of sexual dominance to be discussed shortly--and the impact that people have on each other’s growth and identity is shown as both a sadness and a joy throughout the novel.‘That’s money, the substance that makes the world real. There’s something so corrupt and sexy about it.’It is easy to get invested in the non-relationship of Marianne and Connell, which really pulls the novel forward through authentic raw emotion, but what really makes the novel work is the ways their relationship, and sex, becomes an avenue to examine power dynamics. What is particularly interesting about Marianne and Connell are their particular social classes and how these shape the way they interact with their world.He and Marianne never talked about money. They had never talked, for example, about the fact that her mother paid his mother money to scrub their floors and hang their laundry, or about the fact that this money circulated indirectly to Connell, who spent it, as often as not, on Marianne.While the two rarely discuss money, the influences of late capitalism are very much a part of their identities. Marianne stays on in Dublin and never has to work whereas Connell spends his weekends back home working in a garage and he is looked down upon at Trinity by his peers due to his working class status. It even causes a “breakup” between him and Marianne after their first year when his pride in not asking her to stay at her place since he cannot afford rent is seen by her as him wanting to go home to see other people and disguising it as not having the money to stay in Dublin for the summer. To her the idea of simply not being able to pay rent seems like an aberration from reality. When they are both awarded a scholarship, Connell is irked that for him it is a necessity to fund school but for Marianne it is just a status symbol (and her being awarded the money means a student who actually needed it was denied the money). It is then pointed out to Connell that he is accepting being served dinner at the award ceremony by his own working class peers, essentially throwing guilt back at him as a working-class traitor. This is a typical knee-jerk reaction of a dominant class, repositioning guilt to create in-fighting within the subordinate classes as the dominant class continues on unimpeded.Guilt manifests itself in many ways throughout the novel. Self-doubt and shame enter into many of the characters in the later portion of the novel and there is even a suicide of a character Connell remembers most as someone who built their personality out of trying to be accepted by others. The social posturing and societal guilt that drives it becomes toxic at a point. Most pronounced is Marianne’s self-guilt and the ways her history of trauma still keeps her in it’s grasp:Denise decided a long time ago that it is acceptable for men to use aggression towards Marianne as a way of expressing themselves. As a child, Marianne resisted, but now she simply detaches, as if it isn\'t of any interest to her, which in a way it isn\'t. Denise considers this a symptom of her daughter\'s frigid and unlovable personality. She believes Marianne lacks \'warmth\', by which she means the ability to beg for love from people who hate her.Central to the novel are the sexual growth and identities of Marianne, which Rooney has pegged as a deviant, and Connell who is motivated by privacy, shame and supposed normalcy. Connell views sex as a very private act--he is very flustered when Peggy suggests a threesome with Marianne and Connell--and forces his and Marianne’s relationship to be secret in fear of other’s thinking him abnormal for being with her. He is bothered by her desires for submission and thinks of himself as better than being able to go along with them. As sex is often a metaphor for capitalism in the book, Connell is attempting to be “ethical”, but it is also an issue that he consistently views her prior history and sexuality as constituting abnormality and being “damaged” (as he often puts it). There is a sense of the classic Catholic guilt at play and his revulsion towards her wishes to be hit puts a wedge between them.‘Is the world such an evil place, that love should be indistinguishable from the basest and most abusive forms of violence?’Marianne, as mentioned earlier, tends towards a more devil-may-care attitude towards sex and has a preference for being abused. A major criticism of the book are the ways that submissive preference and being damaged are overly entangled. Using sex as a critique of capitalism, the submissive behavior and those who eagerly dominate over her is an insightful examination of power dynamics, but I do concede the argument that it minimizes the possibility of an aggressive sexual relationship founded on love and mutual understanding instead of only being an avenue for abuse and actual sadists like all the examples in the novel. Moving on. Under capitalism, the female body is inevitably commodified and her dominators tend to see her more as an object to control rather than an equal partner. Her boyfriends are all abusers of power: the first is hosting a fascist to speak on campus, the second is the son of a banker central to causing the economic collapse in Ireland (he also tells stories about his friends working in the US banking industry as if the housing bubble collapse is funny anecdote), and the third is an artist who enjoys photographing torture. It is best stated when the Swedish artist coerces Marianne into being tied up more, ignoring her pleas to stop by telling her he knows she’ll do it because she loves him and he loves her. She wonders ‘Could he really do the gruesome things he does to her and believe at the same time he’s acting out of love?’The need to possess her and abuse her is mirrored in the social class aspects of the novel. While the likely-sociopathic Jamie does not physically abuse her outside of bed, his emotional abuse is far worse--much like the way the wealthy class gaslights the lower classes into remaining submissive. Unfortunately, Rooney’s answer to the sexual questions raised by the book are a bit of a let-down compromise that gives masculinity unnecessary applause. At two pivotal moments in the book, Connell stands up to an abuser--one in high school when she is groped and the other at the end when her nose has been broken--by swooping in through a display of being more masculine than the abuser. It feels overly traditional, much like the sexual roles, in a novel that would be better served by pushing limits. The sexual compromise of the two at the end, with Marianne basically submitting to his love and masculinity, feels like a cop-out for an ending that is already far too tidy than it need be.Despite this, the novel registers as a success overall. Rooney leaves the novel on a note of uncertainty, a similar tone that fueled the infectious nature of the novel, which makes up for the overly tidy emotional climax and resolution. It seems inevitable that there will be a miniseries of this with Ed Sheeran\'s Castles on the Hill blasting over a montage of Connell and Marianne--this idea almost makes me want to drop a star, though I won\'t--and while this work is imperfect it achieves what it sets out to do and I very much enjoyed reading it. I couldn\'t put it down to be honest. These characters are easy to care for, the story is engrossing and the undercurrents of themes and social criticisms are well executed. This novel is a serious dose of early romance nostalgia that doesn’t sugar coat anything. The imperfections and complexities of love and identity are what makes this novel function at its best and I will be eagerly awaiting her next book.4.5/5Her eyes fill up with tears again and she closes them. Even in memory she will find this moment unbearably intense, and she\'s aware of this now, while it\'s happening. She has never believed herself fit to be loved by any person. But now she has a new life, of which this is the first moment, and even after many years have passed she will still think: Yes, that was it, the beginning of my life.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I had been influenced by a friend - whom I adore & respect - by her 1 star review.... way before this book started gaining momentum and hit the stores a month ago.This book wasn’t for my friend - but it sure was for me.I’ve own an ‘Advance Reader’s Edition’, of Sally Rooney’s paper copy for a year and a half. It sat on my shelf, unread.Rooney’s first novel “Conversations With Friends”, was wonderful.I admit having a thing for the type of writer Sally Rooney is:*Addicting* thought-provoking reading for me. “Normal People” is contemporary - romantic-tragic - comic - fresh - psychologically sharp - emotional - and very perceptive.Rooney leaves me lingering in her characters. They are flawed and frustrated.I ‘felt’ flawed and frustrated reading it! At times I wanted to scream at the characters - other times my heart just broke.I knew I wanted to read this novel. I even knew it would most likely drive me into my head. ( it did).I’m not sure why I didn’t open it last year.The book-cover alone has that ‘curl-up-and-get- sucked-in- feeling’, to it.And that’s exactly what happened.I COULD NOT STOP READING. ‘Addicted’!I will never doubt my own gut desire again when it comes to a Sally Rooney novel.I’m a fan here to stay.Totally love what she creates.SOMETHING HAS SHIFTED IN ME, too, with respect to romance novels. I can no longer say...“Oh, I don’t read romance novels”... It depends...Heck, “Crime and Punishment”, had romance. Loaded with power and cruelty... but still some romance.“East of Eden”, by John Steinbeck was filled with juicy romance...( destructive force)... but still...lust and romance was present.Helen Hoang’s book, “The Kiss Quotient”, more modern, had romance written all over it. I loved it, too.Laugh at me if you wish...but in the same way that I got hooked on the two main characters, ( Tessa and Hardin), in Anna Todd’s “After Series”.....( also a young author like Sally Rooney)....I was hooked on the relationship’ between Connell and Marianne in “Normal People”.I’m sure that Rooney would not turn this book into a series… but if she did, I’d read it.The electricity and entanglement between this Connell and Marianne - was soooo complex. I wanted to join their conversations about their families—about the way each felt about themselves, and each other.... and all the things that were happening to them.When I finished the last page, my mind continued swimming in thoughts.Most, I was sad to leave them.Soooo many fabulous sentences - page after page. Gorgeous reflective and intimate writing.Sally Rooney is an ‘it’ author for me.LOVED IT!!!! ....Ha... if you can’t tell.I’ll end with one expert:“All these years they’ve been like two little plants sharing the same pot of soil, growing around one another, contorting to make room, taking certain unlikely positions”.'}]"

Estranged from his family, living alone with only his cat Cabbage for company, he was unprepared for the doctor’s diagnosis that he has only months to live. But before he can set about tackling his bucket list, the Devil appears with a special offer: in exchange for making one thing in the world disappear, he can have one extra day of life. And so begins a very bizarre week . . .Because how do you decide what makes life worth living? How do you separate out what you can do without from what you hold dear? In dealing with the Devil our narrator will take himself – and his beloved cat – to the brink.

It's simply amazing.I laughed and cried while reading this one. It's endearing and will remain as one of the most memorable reads.*What made this read different:The main characters are nothing sort of unique or dramatic yet yes, one of the characters was the Devil himself.And then there's this cat called Cabbage.

I think that the Japanese novels, including almost all ofHaruki Murakami\'s books, have portrayed cats in the best way possible and showed the beautiful relationship between cats and humans.What will you do if the devil comes to you making an offer when you are busy preparing a list of things to do before you die after you come to know about your terminal illness? The devil says that he will grant one extra day of life in exchange for making one thing disappear from this world. Does this offer appear to be very tricky to him? Will the protagonist accept this request? What will happen to his health? The author tries to give answers to these through this novel.What I learned from this book1) What is the biggest problem with human beings\' expectations?The author is telling the problem with our expectations. We expect the best from others while we are not ready to give the same to them.In the case of relationships, we expect unconditional love from our partners when we never try to love them unconditionally. This world never works in that way. You will get an honest partner or friend or colleague only when you are honest with them. If you want your children to love you, you should first love your own parents.The author tries to tell us the problems with our thought processes and expectations.""I wonder why people always expect things from others that they themselves can\'t or won\'t do.""2) Why are most book lovers also cat lovers?I have always wondered why most readers almost always love cats. There are many reasons for it. The author indirectly tells one of the reasons for it in this book.Solitude is a crucial factor that is needed for reading for most readers. (There are also exceptions to this as some people can read books in any environment and any time.) Most readers love to read a book enjoying the bliss of solitude. Cats are the ideal companions who will give us peace to enjoy this solitude (in most cases). They also provide us with a company when we need their company.“Cats are really something. They\'ll just ignore you half the time, but they seem to know when you\'re really in need of some comforting.Cats and humans have been partners for over ten thousand years. And what you realize when you\'ve lived with a cat for a long time is that we may think we own them, but that\'s not the way it is. They simply allow us the pleasure of their company”3) Bucket listA bucket list is a list of achievements or experiences that a person likes to have or accomplish during their lifetime. We can see the author sharing an interesting bucket list in this novel.“Go skydiving.Climb Mt. Everest.Speed along on the autobahn in a Ferrari.Go along to a traditional three-day-long feast of gourmet Chinese food.Take a ride on a Transformer\'s back.Find love in these final Days of Our Lives.Go on a date with Princess Leia.Turn a corner just in time to run into a beautiful woman carrying a cup of coffee, and watch our passionate love affair unfold from there.Run into the girl I had a crush on in school while sheltering from the rain.Did I mention I\'d like to fall in love? Just once . . .”My favourite three lines from this book“In order to gain something you have to lose something.”“I don\'t know whether I\'m happy or unhappy. But there\'s one thing I do know. You can convince yourself to be happy or unhappy. It just depends on how you choose to see things.”""I scooped the cat up and snuggled him against my chest for comfort. He was warm and soft, a smooth fluffy ball of fur in my arms.

It was clunky, American English, and made me feel like an American teen had written it. Japanese literature that I've read is often quirky and a little odd (see Murakami!) but usually odd in a good way. This just left me a feeling a bit cold.The part I liked was the part with the cat, but much of the rest left me unmoved. The storyteller has been given days to live, but then the devil appears & tells him that if he gets rid of 'something' from the world, he can buy himself an extra day. I felt it was obvious that you get rid of something bad or unobtrusive, like brussel sprouts, but this guy gets rid of telephones...The ending was a bit too heavy on the sweet, and there was something just not quite right with the whole story.

Perhaps the story would have been more moving with a better translation (it\'s awkward and honestly feels like the writing level of a high school creative writing course; moments of cleverness with a lot of awkward phrasing).This is also one of the few books with a spoiler in the title, given that going in you know the devil is removing things from the world each day. Huh... I wonder if perhaps cats will be one of them?It\'s not all bad. I like the idea that the devil is a doppelgänger of the lead. Given that the book seems to operate under several Christian principals in terms of how it views God and the devil, I like the implication that humans are made in God\'s image but the devil is made in ours. I also like the fact that he\'s presented as more subtle in his actions. He\'s offering something most would want (more life) and slowly making it a life not worth living by taking away the joys you experience.The book is designed to try to hit your emotions. At one point it has the narrator discuss the feeling of watching the movie E.T. when he was three. He couldn\'t remember all the plot but he remembered how it made him feel. Obviously this is what the author is going for here, that even if you forget aspects of the plot, he wants you to remember those feelings. I know several people will find that charming, but that\'s instantly a negative point for me. It\'s honestly the reason I don\'t like MOST of Spielberg\'s films (I\'m a big cinema fan, but I can count the number of his movies I even like on one hand). I personally feel that the over sentimental approach, with a story that can be summed up in one paragraph (but by God you felt emotions, right?) is honestly not a story worth even telling. It never earns those emotions from me if that\'s all it has to offer... It\'s at this point that Tim feels like a heartless monster even voicing this, but it\'s his review and he\'s sticking to this heartless approach.In the end do I suggest this? If you can tolerate a super simplistic story that aims to seem deep while really only trying to tug on your emotions like a child desperately seeking attention and/or candy while the adults are talking, sure, knock yourself out. Personally, the only reason it isn\'t getting one star is because of the interesting ideas it presents on the devil and some of the comments it makes on the nature of cinema in one chapter.

This is such a poignantly told tale of magical realism.The narrator ofIf Cats Disappeared from the Worldis a young, single postman from Japan who has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. After receiving this crushing diagnosis from his doctor, he arrives home at his apartment to find the devil. The devil makes a deal with him: he will grant one additional day of life to the narrator for each item that he chooses to eliminate from the world.Each chapter ofIf Cats Disappeared from the Worldfollows one day in the last week of the narrator’s life as he agrees to eliminate phones, movies, clocks, etc., from the world. But what about his beloved cats? Would he be willing to sacrifice them to prolong his life one more day?Every day, the absence of these items floods our introspective narrator with memories of his loves and his regrets: his ex-girlfriend, his best friend, his mother, his father, his childhood cat (Lettuce), and his current feline friend (Cabbage). The narrator eloquently describes the universal pain of losing loved ones and of strained relationships.If Cats Disappeared from the Worldis a beautifully written novel. The poignant scenes from the narrator are juxtaposed with humorous commentary from the devil, striking just the right emotional balance throughout the book.Genki Kawamura’s writing is heavily influenced by Haruki Murakami. As in Murakami’s classic,Kafka on the Shore, Kawamura’s cat, Cabbage, even talks. If someone were to scratch Genki Kawamura’s name off the cover and write Haruki Murakami as the author, I would not doubt for a moment that I was reading a genuine Murakami novel. The imitation of Murakami’s themes and style is that authentic.Normally I would deduct a star for mimicking another writer’s style so closely, but I can’t do that here becauseIf Cats Disappeared from the Worldis just so good. If this were a Murakami book, it would rank among his best. The introspective nature and emotional impact of this book rank up there with Murakami’sNorwegian Wood, one of my all-time favorite novels.Five very enthusiastic stars forIf Cats Disappeared from the World, Genki Kawamura’s heartfelt debut novel.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""This is the story of a very dull and staggeringly self-centred man who makes a deal with the devil to deprive other people of things they love in order to extend his pointless empty life.

He quotes the Forrest Gump line about life being like a box of chocolates as a wise and perfect summary of the human condition. If that works for you, you'll love this book.

Sin importar sus defectos, merecen respeto por el esfuerzo y tiempo que requieren para su creación. Sin embargo, en esta ocasión tengo que declarar que personalmente ha sido una experiencia decepcionante la lectura de esta obra. Todo el tiempo me sentí aburrido y preguntándome en que momento finalizaría.Los problemas comenzaron desde la mismísima sinopsis porque allí se expone el resumen completo del libro. ¿Cómo emocionarme, sorprenderme o crear suposiciones si desde el inicio ya conocía el final? Aun así, seguí avanzando porque cuando leí La Ladrona de Libros —libro que me encantó por cierto — eso mismo me ocurrió, por lo que decidí darle una oportunidad. Desagradable sería mi sorpresa al encontrar que es mejor la portada y la sinopsis, que el libro en sí.Lo que encontré, fue una historia con conversaciones deficientes por lo tajantes que eran y con unos personajes que estaban mal construidos porque ni tenían nombre, ni su comportamiento era natural y además platicaban todos de la misma manera. Por ejemplo, en la escena donde “el cartero” y el diablo se encuentran, lo conveniente sería que el cartero se sintiera aterrorizado e intimidado ante la presencia del señor de las tinieblas, tanto así que se le dificultará incluso hablar. Pero lo que encontramos es un protagonista que trata al diablo como si fuera su amigo de toda la vida y que incluso le pide perdón en algunas ocasiones por molestarlo. Perdónenme, pero eso es lo más absurdo que he leído.Sentí bastante desagrado por el personaje principal hasta llegar al punto de dejar de importarme si el personaje se salvaba o no de la muerte. No puedo juzgar la reacción de cada individuo al conocer que están a punto de morir, pero en caso de saberlo, ¿no sería más normal aprovechar cada segundo viviendo al límite, en vez de estar llorando, recordando todo lo negativo que se vivió y sintiendo arrepentimiento por todo lo que no se hizo? Si nos vamos a morir, pues hay que aprovechar lo que nos queda y punto. Por ello, no me gustó el rol que Kawamura le asignó al protagonista, porque me gusta que me conmuevan con historias y no con personajes que todo el tiempo se sienten victimas e intentan producir lastima. Este fue un error fatal.Por otra parte, valoro la intención del autor de realizar una crítica a la sociedad por la adicción y el uso excesivo del móvil y el reloj, pero la idea merecía aprovecharla mejor. Si tan solo hubiera presentado el comportamiento del mundo ante la ausencia de cualquiera de estos aparatos, creo que merecería las dos estrellas. Pero es que ni eso, el mundo siempre fue igual, nadie se inmutó e incluso hablaban con indiferencia sobre lo que había desaparecido. La falta de lógica fue la constante en esta historia.Ya para terminar y dejar lo positivo para el final, quiero destacar la importancia de los gatos en esta historia. Gracias a la presencia de estos animales es que los personajes llegan a tener un vínculo entre ellos y hallar paz en sus vidas. Asimismo, nos permite comprender la decisión final del protagonista porque quienes tenemos mascotas y las amamos, en un punto tan crítico quizás tomaríamos la misma decisión. Sin embargo, son tan pocos aspectos positivos los que encuentro en esta obra que la calificación no podría ser más baja. Desafortunadamente, desde las primeras páginas eso quedó muy claro para mí: No les miento.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Początek był dla mnie trudny do przebrnięcia, ale mimo specyfiki książki, naprawdę mnie poruszyła.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“È da tanto che non piango per un libro.”È con questo pensiero che sono andato a letto la scorsa notte.

Credevo che se uno è felice lo è automaticamente anche la sua ragazza. Ma gli eventi a volte prendono una piega inaspettata e arrivano momenti in cui uno è felice e la sua ragazza è triste. L'amore finisce sempre. Lo sappiamo tutti, ma ci innamoriamo lo stesso. È la stessa cosa che accade con la vita. Sappiamo tutti che prima o poi finisce, ma viviamo lo stesso. Forse è proprio perché sono destinati a finire che l'amore e la vita sono meravigliosi.”“Se inizi a pensare al senso, la tua vita non comincerà mai. Che importanza ha il senso?

Per forza. Se le cose stanno così, penso, quando decido di far scomparire qualcosa dal mondo, commetto un reato gravissimo! Anche le meduse hanno senso di esistere. Ma nel mio caso vivere stava perdendo di significato, forse ora valevo meno di una medusa.”“Che cosa avevo guadagnato, e che cosa avevo perso, diventando adulto? Non avrei mai potuto riavere le emozioni e i sentimenti provati in passato, e per qualche motivo quel pensiero mi aveva travolto con un’ondata di tristezza irrefrenabile.

It is the pride and joy of her uncle Satoru, who has devoted his life to the bookshop since his wife Momoko left him five years earlier.When Takako's boyfriend reveals he's marrying someone else, she reluctantly accepts her eccentric uncle's offer to live rent-free in the tiny room above the shop. Hoping to nurse her broken heart in peace, Takako is surprised to encounter new worlds within the stacks of books lining the Morisaki bookshop.As summer fades to autumn, Satoru and Takako discover they have more in common than they first thought.

Estaba esperando emocionarme hasta más no poder con este libro, pero nunca llegó el momento. Se me hizo un relato bastante plano, pero cuya narrativa era muy simple y fácil de leer (yo diría que me demoré dos horas en terminarlo). Es cierto que tiene frases realmente hermosas, pero siento que, en mi caso, es una lectura muy olvidable (de aquí a dos semanas se me va a olvidar por completo todo el libro).

Although, I have heard a lot of positive buzz about this book in the past year, I was curious if it would live up to its billing. Overall, I found the narrative to be very captivating, while at the same time written in a very accessible, 'smooth as jazz' style that seems common among many internationally acclaimed Japanese authors. I loved how Yagisawa skillfully crafted an engaging story from a fairly simple plot, with a few minor twists. It was like feasting on a well prepared meal (like Ramen) made from a few fresh, high-quality ingredients.Days at the Morisaki Bookshop brought to life the rich atmosphere in the Jimbocho district in Tokyo, with its myriad bookstores and throngs of avid book enthusiasts. So, you might ask why was it not a 5⭐ read for me? All I can say is that this novel did not linger with me after I finished it. Days at the Morisaki Bookshop was an entertaining read, however, after I set it aside I moved on to reading the next book on my list without dwelling on it. I think this may partly be due to the story's somewhat happy ending, which seemed a bit too perfect. Although, I must confess as I was reading this book, I was thinking to myself that I could see this being made into a movie - which apparently has been done in Japan! Overall, I would highly recommend Days at the Morisaki Bookshop to anyone, especially if you are interested in exploring contemporary Japanese literature.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ': ̗̀➛ 4 stars""Don’t be afraid to love someone.

A bike to the left, and a sea of books – left – top - right. And, there is a door in the middle with a silhouette of what we can presume is a man to the left and a woman to the right. And, the title of the book is in the center at the top. There are other details if you want to really spend some time reviewing the cover which makes it even more fun.I bring this up because it is the cover of this book that attracted me to read it.And, to be honest it is another one of those books with the word “bookshop” in the title that also got me interested. I like to read at least one book (a month, if possible) with a bookshop in my reading adventure list in-between a mystery (if it isn’t a mystery, as well).And, this one is written by a Japanese writer and translated by Eric Ozawa.One thing I believe that is often true for us readers, is that we are drawn to bookstores like nature lovers are drawn to views. Whenever my husband and I were travelling we couldn’t leave a town without stopping at the local bookstore or library. It was a must-see stop, ALWAYS. If they were closed, I would just salivate at the window display. At least I, could look at the latest best sellers, or get a sense of who their local authors were, by who they displayed in their window.Bottom line, there is something hopeful about bookstores. I can’t help but love the smell of books, the touch of books, and don’t we just feel a little bit smarter when we are surrounded by books? Well, at least I pretend to be.But I digress. Let’s get to this review.This is a heart-warming story that shows how literature helps to open doors for those who have difficulty expressing their feelings. Like Takado, our main character.And speaking of Takado, she is our plain-speaking 25-year-old narrator. She doesn’t express her feelings well to others. And thus, it is no surprise how easily she has been taken advantage of by her boyfriend, Hideaki. We quickly learn on page 1, that he has dumped Takado and has announced he is getting married, but still wants to play around with her, even though he is engaged to somebody else.Takado always thought they were serious, even though he didn’t want anyone to know they were in a relationship (they both worked together). So, Takado’s only recourse is to quit her job and head home to mope.Her Uncle Satoru offers her free lodging if she will help in his bookshop. Feeling that she really doesn’t have much choice, she takes him up on the offer.“That’s where my real life began. And I know without a doubt, that if not for those days, the rest of my life would have been bland, monotonous, and lonely.”The characters of her uncle, his wife and others are quite interesting, quirky and personable and add to the enjoyment of the story.And as the story unfolds, readers watch as life opens up in ways Takado never thought possible.And, as readers, who already love to read, we get to watch Takado’s self-confidence grow, as well as witness how the importance of reading can and does make a difference in a person’s life.And, that my friends, is the beauty of the transformation of books.Sidenote: this book was originally published in Japan 2010, and adapted into film in Japan, but was not translated into English until 2023.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3,5. Takako es una joven de 25 años que acaba de perder de golpe tanto a su pareja y como su trabajo. Esto la sumerge en una profunda apatía, alejándose de todo y de todos. Sin embargo, un día recibe la llamada de su tío Satoru, al cual lleva más de diez años sin ver. Este tiene una propuesta que hacerle, y después de presionarla, consigue que Takako se mude a vivir al pequeño pisito ubicado en la planta superior de la librería de segunda mano Morisaki, en el famoso barrio de las librerías, Jinbocho, el más grande del mundo dedicado a los libros. Satoru heredó la librería hace años y tras muchas idas y venidas por el mundo, descubrió que esta pequeña librería era su lugar en el mundo. ¿Puede encontrar Takako el mismo regocijo en la librería Morisaki?No puedo remediar amar profundamente este tipo de historias que nos muestra el día a día de sus personajes, centrándose en lo cotidiano para mostrarnos el dilema de sus protagonistas y como estos buscan consuelo en lo esencial. Es un poco lo que pasa con Takako, que pese a que de niña quería y admiraba a su tío, la adolescencia rompió esa imagen que tenia sobre él, sin embargo, acaba encontrando en él y sobre todo en la librería Morisaki el consuelo que necesita, ese algo al que aferrarse para volver a salir a flote. Creo que a cualquier lector le gusta encontrar historias donde los libros se muestren como salvavidas, como elementos de aprendizaje y crecimiento. Es imposible no empatizar con ese sentimiento que todos hemos vivido en algún momento.Leí este libro con una amiga y desde que lo conocimos con su edición en italiano, sabíamos que era el tipo de lectura que disfrutaríamos. De entrada se nos antojaba que “Mis días en la librería Morisaki” iba a ser este tipo de libro confortable, que a mí me gusta comparar con dar un paseo por un lugar agradable, del que siempre sales reconfortado, y aunque es totalmente ese tipo de libro, ambos tuvimos la misma sensación sobre él: libro bonito y tierno muy disfrutable, pero que nos hubiese gustado que fuera más largo, para que fuera más reposado y poder indagar algo más en algunos momentos y personajes. Se nos hizo demasiado breve y alguna trama se queda poco explorada.El libro se divide en dos partes muy diferenciadas y claramente la primera parte con Takako y Satoru en la librería ha sido mi favorita, y me ha gustado bastante más que la segunda, que podría ser más profunda que la primera, pero me ha dejado con ganas de ver más. Lo que sí he disfrutado mucho ha sido la relación que se forja entre Takako y Wada, un personaje que aparece en esta segunda parte, aunque también me hubiera gustado verla más mostradaEso sí, disfruto mucho de la habilidad de los japoneses no solo para crear historias agradables y reconfortantes, si no para ubicarlas en escenarios que sin haber visto en tu vida, te resultan familiares, hogareños, lugares en los que sientes que has estado, aunque nunca los hayas visitado. Pasa un poco eso con Jinbocho, ese barrio lleno de librerías (que ya pongo como objetivo de vida visitarlo algún día), también con Morisaki, esa librería llena de libros por todas partes o el monte donde sus protagonistas viajan para desconectar de la ciudad. Los autores japoneses consiguen sumergirme como nadie en esos lugares que describen.Pese a que me he quedado con ganas de que “Mis días en la librería Morisaki” fuese más extenso, lo bueno es que el autor escribió un segundo libro varios años después, que al parecer está centrado en Satoru y Momoko, siendo este último un personaje que me hubiera gustado conocer más y mejor, así que ojalá la editorial se anime a traernos también esta segunda entrega, porque pienso lanzarme de cabeza.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'It gently eased my soul.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'Sutil como la ceremonia del té, hermosa como los cerezos en flor y melancólica como el cine de autor japonés, así es la novela corta Mis días en la librería Morisaki de Satoshi Yagisawa que ha conquistado el corazón de lectores bibliófilos a lo largo y ancho de todo el mundo y que, con traducción de Estefanía Asins, acaba de ser editada en España por Plata Editores, un nuevo sello que promete darnos muchas alegrías lectoras.Y es que solo se me ocurre un escenario más sugerente para un amante de los libros que una librería: un barrio lleno de ellas. Allí, a Jinbōchō, es donde da a parar Takako después de que le rompan el corazón y necesite un lugar donde replantearse su futuro. Su tío regenta una antigua librería familiar de segunda mano especializada en literatura japonesa y le ofrece el ático del local para que allí la joven vuelva a conectar consigo misma.Al principio se siente perdida y fuera de lugar en un ambiente tan bucólico e intelectual… Pero el olor del polvo de los antiguos volúmenes apilados en las estanterías, el ambiente del barrio bohemio, las peculiaridades de cada uno de los clientes habituales… le hacen conectar con más cosas además de consigo misma: con el gran desconocido que resultó ser su tío, con los chicos que regentan el café de la esquina… y hasta con un apuesto y misterioso lector que se pasa las horas leyendo siempre en la misma mesa.Mis días en la librería Morisaki es una obra cálida que hará disfrutar al público lector al que le apasionan las historias serenas, introspectivas, que se cocinan a fuego lento. Además de una adquisición perfecta para conmemorar el Marzo asiático, esta obra es un bucólico paréntesis del torbellino urbano que nos rodea.Y es que… ¿quién no ha sido Tatako en algún momento de su vida? ¿Quién no ha necesitado frenar en seco para tomar impulso? ¿Quién no se ha dado cuenta de que ha construido una vida de espaldas a sus raíces? ¿Quién no sueña con una época dedicada solamente a escucharse a sí mismo, a emprender un nuevo rumbo, a recargar las pilas?Mis días en la librería Morisaki hará las delicias del público japonófilo. Entre sus páginas se nos narra el día a día de un rincón oculto de esa inabarcable urbe, pero también se nos desmenuzan distintas formas de vivir y sentir en el Tokio de hoy en día. Cada uno de los curiosos personajes con los que confraterniza la tímida Tatako representa una forma de ser distinta que encapsula al propio Japón: su melancólico tío, su extravagante tía, los chismosos chicos del café, el hierático cliente habitual… constituyen un mosaico que nos habla de una sociedad compleja, contradictoria, en constante evolución.Esta breve y sutil novelita es una lectura perfecta para recuperar la fe en el poder sanador de los libros, para hacer despertar el amor por las pequeñas cosas que a menudo nos pasan desapercibidas en nuestro ajetreado día a día.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""This book is without a doubt, a truly heartwarming read.

It's a wholesome, sweet, and comforting story that will undoubtedly leave a lasting imprint on your heart.From that moment on, I read relentlessly, one book after another. It was as if a love of reading had been sleeping somewhere deep inside me all this time, and then it suddenly sprang to life.Little by little, I felt something wash over me, a feeling of peace that words can't express. If I had to explain it, I'd say it could only have come from the writer's fervent love for life.The story revolves around a small, second-hand bookshop, Morisaki Bookshop, and the wonderful cast of characters who call it home. The narrative centers on Takako, whose life takes a transformative turn following a heartbreak when she retreats to her family's bookstore, managed by her uncle Saturo. As the characters navigate the ups and downs of life, their journeys are intertwined with the books they read and recommend, resulting in a brilliant tapestry of self-discovery.At some point in the past, someone reading this book had felt moved to take a pen and draw a line under these words. It made me happy to think that because I had been moved by that same passage too, I was now connected to that stranger.Another time, I happened to find a pressed flower someone had left as a bookmark. As I inhaled the scent of the long-ago-faded flower, I wondered about the person who had put it there. Who in the world was she? When did she live? What was she feeling?It's only in secondhand books that you can savor encounters like this, connections that transcend time.

No os engañaré, esta lectura ha sido la peor que he tenido en los últimos meses. Algo que obviamente no esperaba, ya que a pesar de saber que no iba a ser un libro inolvidable tenía el convencimiento de que encontraría una historia “feel good”, algo agradable y ligero para disfrutar.Nada más lejos de la realidad: entre sus páginas he hallado una trama lineal, sumamente básica y carente de descripción alguna, dotada de personajes planos, sin carácter definido y sumamente incoherentes (mención especial a la protagonista que no puede ser más repelente). La trama, aparte de previsible, en muchas ocasiones pierde el sentido, fuerza relaciones y sentimientos que no traspasan las páginas y no convencen en absoluto al lector.Eso no es todo: aquí no hay literatura, ni cultura japonesa, ni librerías, ni largas charlas emocionantes, ni puesta en situación… La novela bien podría estar ambientada en una heladería de un centro comercial en Estados Unidos y no notaríamos la diferencia. La narración, los diálogos y cómo se desarrollan los hechos, denota que estamos ante un relato banal, por su sencillez y por la escasa profundidad general.En definitiva, me he llevado una gran decepción con esta obra contando que lo mejor que he encontrado es la ilustración de la portada. Y encima, no podía faltar el drama metido con calzador que encontraremos al final y el nacimiento de un amor que no veíamos venir (nótese la ironía).

Yagisawa’s novel details Takako’s journey as she finds solace in reading and the small pleasures offered by the local community: from eccentric customers to charming coffee shops. The story then skips ahead over a period of years, moving from Takako to her uncle Satoru as he’s reunited with his long-lost wife Momoko, after her mysterious disappearance.

The forbidden romance 😍 the slow burn 😍 the fact that she's a princess and he's her bodyguard 😍 the spice 😍 I liked Twisted Love, but I LOVED this sequel.Rhys is definitely a protective alpha male type which isn't quite my ideal book boyfriend. That's the only reason I gave it 4.5 instead of 5 stars (but that's just a personal taste thing). One thing I didn't expect and really loved was how much princess subplot we got. Outside of the romance, we get a really rich plot of the politics of Bridget's country and the responsibilities and pressures she's under as a princess.Also, I loved that there's a HUGE reason they can't be together for a good part of the book.

Say it ain\'t so!I have trouble passing up books with the word ""bodyguard"" in its description (cue ""I Will Always Love You"" by Whitney Houston). In fact, I picked up the first book of this series solely because I wanted to read this one. The princess and the bodyguard is a pairing as old as time, not to mention absolutely swoon-worthy, and before I cracked open the first page, I was filled to the brim with anticipatory glee for all the fun I was about to have.And for the most part, I enjoyed the story itself. It was a bit long-winded, but compared to instalove, I\'ll take a slow burn any day. While this didn\'t break any new ground and is pretty much what you\'d expect from the trope, it was still fun. Rhys the Bodyguard is all like I take security very seriously ma\'am, and Bridget the Princess is all like you can\'t tell me what to do. I\'m totally on board with that.And yet. Yet, yet, yet. I feel like something was missing. Was it better chemistry, more snarky banter? I\'m not sure. All I know is what I got felt like a paler version of what it could\'ve been. Or maybe the problem is me and I built this up so much in my head, nothing could possibly meet it.One thing I do know for sure is that Ana Huang\'s male characters are a bit too much for me. They\'re so sexed up and possessive, it\'s hard to take them seriously. They way they talk and act, you\'d think they came straight from the chest-thumping Stone Age. No other man can even look at their women, lest glares and threats erupt from their mouths. They\'re constantly like, Who do you belong to? Me! And that\'s more or less verbatim.And the sex scenes. Ugh, I feel like such an old fuddy duddy for saying this, but they were so frequent and unrealistic in that porny way, I was cringing with embarrassment for the characters. I enjoyed the first third of the book so much more simply because there was no sex in it. But the last two-thirds felt like every other scene was dramatic sex, and I was so over it.It\'s hard to really enjoy a story if I\'m cringing my way through so much of it, and that\'s what happened here. Obviously, romances are personal, and this is clearly a case where my tastes just don\'t quite line up with the author\'s. And there\'s nothing wrong with that.

Here’s the thing—this had all of the makings of a 5 star book EXCEPT for the fact that I found the beginning quite slow. And I fully get that its slow burn, its meant to be that way, but I can’t ignore how i felt when I was still in the beginning stages.There are TONS of build up in part 1, and the book itself really started taking off for me in part 2. The build up in part 1 is still soooo good, especially looking back at it now. I definitely appreciate it more after finishing the whole book more than i did when i was going through it.I am so obsessed with Rhys and Bridget, but obviously definitely Rhys because that’s my guyyyyy.Bearded, protective, HOTTTT, possessive, supports and adores and loves Bridget so much.

And I definitely liked this book wayyyy more than i liked the first one, twisted love.I think the writing improved a ton, and the time jumps were that much easier to follow whereas i felt like it was a little difficult to know how much time had passed in the first book (one of the main reasons I gave that a 4). This one is just way better for me. ITS STEAMIER, ITS SO POSSESSIVE, the tension between them. I’m literally so into it 😂And I cant stop thinking about Rhys. This man is BEAUTIFUL. All of the qualities i like in my alpha characters.How part 1 felt for me is mainly the reason this isn’t getting 5 stars because i feel like that’s my first impression and it’s like one of those things where when i was in school, people always told me to go with the first answer when i was taking an exam 😂 so I’m applying that same theory here LMAOChef’s kiss, i hope you guys enjoy this when you get to it!

Rhys and Bridget will always be one of my favourite couples of all time and I honestly can’t get enough of them!!First of all, this book has one of my favourite (but also one of the most painful) tropes of all time in it: Forbidden love!!!This alone already had me hooked and in love but the way it was executed… COMPLETE AND UTTER PERFECTION!!!!!The secrecy, the tension, the pining, the chemistry.. UGH it was just all soooo good and so well written!!! The way they both wanted one another since the beginning.. I was MELTINGGGG!!!!The way the forbidden love trope was mixed with the bodyguard x princess trope made it even better!!! The vibes and settings in this book were absolutely immaculate!! From gorgeous Costa Rica to a stunning castle ugh I LOVE IT!!! I honestly need more books like that with that sort of setting, it’s just so… romantic!!!Speaking of romantic, THESE TWO ARE DEFINITION OF SAID WORD!!!!!!I was literally squealing, giggling, kicking my feet, twirling my hair and blushing like a goddamn tomato!! They were just so adorable!! They had everything they needed to have! Banter, chemistry, tension (romantic and sexual), cuteness, jealousy, spice and MOREEEE!!! They’re just so perfectly written I could cry!!!The way they’re also each others’ rocks?!?!Like Rhys being able to be himself and open up to someone for the first time and feeling so comfortable and feeling AT HOME with Bridget, made my heart beat a million miles per second!!!Same the other way around!! Bridget feeling so at ease with him and actually being able to lean on someone and getting supported by Rhys… It was just so endearing to see them both act so sweetly with each other! No (pure) romance book couple has ever lived up to their love (if you ask me)!!!!!Rhys is also the most perfect man ever!!! He’s definitely the best Twisted man and he might not be YOUR favourite but you can definitely admit that he is THE BEST out of all the Twisted men! Like the way he stood by Bridget no matter what, fought so strongly for their love and is willing to give up everything just to see her happy?!!! I’m crying, screaming…And HE DOES NO WRONG!!!! He didn’t need to grovel because HE IS PERFECT IN EVERY WAY POSSIBLE (if it isn’t obvious enough I’m pretty much in love with him lol)Anyway.. besides the romance, I loved the sub-plot of politics and monarchy! It was amazingly involved into the plot and just shows how corrupt the system can be (most definitely not only in fiction).Seeing Ava and Alex again, happy and together, was also so pleasing to read about and seeing the other characters as well was so endearing!Let’s just say I loved every second of this book and if you haven’t read it yet… GET TO IT NOW!!!!! It is worth EVERYTHING!!! Even if you may have disliked the first book, definitely give this one a try!!Overall, this will most likely always be my favourite romance book and Ana Huang book ever and I’m so glad to have read it not only once but twice!! And I’m already looking forward to rereading it again sometime in the future! I also can’t wait to reread Twisted Hate tomorrow!!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I still cant get over the fact that how the fuck this series is so hyped 💀...especially when there are better..WAY better and sexier books than this'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '✩ 4.35 stars ✩“I was a rule follower by nature.

Happy to report that the rumors are true! Twisted Games really is as good as they say. Maybe I just love all men named Rhys 🤔, but I felt like I was reading a grown up version of the Princess Diaries and I mean that as the highest compliment. The two year jump in their relationship threw me a little at first, but I think it was needed to support that he really was a professional and that his heart softened to her over time.After her brother abdicates his claim to the thrown, Bridget finds herself as the unexpected heir. With this unwelcome change, she feels the last vestiges of her free will slipping away and creates a lists of things she wants to do before she takes the thrown. She basically propositions him, and I felt that this was the best way for them to finally come together. I don’t think he would have ever crossed that line if he hadn’t felt like it was what she needed. He could deny himself, but he couldn’t deny her anything. 🙌🏻 He also thought they would be parting ways since she would no longer need private security once she was living at the palace full time which added to the plausibility of him choosing to break protocol with her.This was a little longer than I typically like a contemporary romance to be, but I always felt very engaged in the story. Their chemistry was sizzling and their backstories and personalities were perfectly developed. I LOVED that we got to read from both POV’s. Nothing beats dual POV with a strait-laced grumpy MMC.

There were also constant, non-stop time jumps that made it completely impossible to actually see any (supposed) development between these two: It’s all tell, and no show. We never really went into detail in any conversation or situation: we literally glanced over everything.Also, Rhys was the most bland hero ever and Bridget had no personality either. All of their interactions honestly bored me to tears or simply just pissed me off. They had no chemistry at all.Part of me wanted to push her away from me, and another part wanted to drag her into my arms and keep her as mine. Except I couldn’t. Bridget was too young, too innocent and too off-limits, and I’d damn well better not forget that.So all in all, there simply wasn’t any depth to be found here, and neither did I see any actual love between them. Once they actually got together all they ever did was have sex. They had no emotional intimacy whatsoever.“Remember. In public, you’re my princess, but in private, you’re my whore.” His other hand reached down and pinched my swollen clit until I squealed, and the beginning tremors of an orgasm rocked through me. “You’ll do what I say, when I say it, and you’ll take my cock however I want. Won’t you?”“Yes,” I breathed.And don’t even get me started on the dirty talk or the weird power dynamics between these two during sex… Every time they were together in anintimateway I just had to cringe.“Keep your underwear, gloves and heels on, and crawl to me.”My breath gusted out in shock even as my core spasmed at the order. I’d never crawled for anyone in my life—while I was all but naked, no less. Even if I wasn’t the future queen, it would be degrading. Humiliating. Depraved. And I’d never been more turned on.I sank to my hands and knees, and I began to crawl.Lastly, the plot in this book was seriously as uninteresting and boring as humanly possible.

I love characters that wear a mask and pretend everything’s okay when they’re actually dealing with a ton (bc I relate) Bridget’s totally like that—seems tough, but you can tell there’s a lot more going on beneath the surface.❝The message: in control and ready to take over.The reality: a complete mess.❞^ THIS is what I’m talking about. Bridget’s journey was wild. Watching her shift into “queen mode” over just a few months? Iconic. She went from struggling to straight-up dominating, all while keeping her cool and making sure she wouldn’t back down. Chef’s kiss.❝Somehow, somewhere along the way, I\'d grown into my new role. It would take a while before I was fully comfortable with it, but I was getting there❞Also, I know we all love when the guy is protective over the girl, but it hit different when Bridget was the one doing it. Like, changing the law for him? *BOW DOWN* to Bridget. She’s a literal queen, period.Okay, before y’all come at me, I gotta be real: Rhys is hot, sure. But personality-wise? Meh. I get that he’s a “bad boy with a soft side,” but honestly, he didn’t do much for me. BUT the way he’s obsessed with Bridget? Oh my god, it hits differently. The way he talks about her? Heart-eyes for days.❝Even when I was pissed at her, I wanted her❞❝I loathed it. Loathed her, for tempting me this way. Loathed myself, for not having more self-control when it came to her❞Like, can we talk about the spice? 🔥 Straight-up fire. The tension between them was so hot and good, and then the moments where things got intense? Whew𝑆𝑜 𝑓𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑢𝑙. 𝑆𝑜 𝑓𝑢𝑐𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑒.“𝐹𝑢𝑐𝑘 𝑚𝑒,"" 𝑠ℎ𝑒 𝑔𝑎𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑑.

""𝐴𝑛𝑑 𝑐𝑟𝑎𝑤𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑚𝑒.""The chemistry between them was to the roof, and I gotta admit, “Crawl to me” is an iconic line. But, like, Zade own that line, I’ll give Rhys a pass on that one, though.This author knows how to write addicting stories. I tore through “Twisted Love” in two days last year, and this one? I thought it was gonna take me forever because it’s longer, but nope. One sitting. Done. The writing? Okay, it’s not gonna win any awards, but it’s like crack. I couldn’t put it down.The relationship? A slow burn to the MAX. Like, it took years for them to admit their feelings and attraction. And honestly, I’m here for it. I read another bodyguard romance recently, and they fell for each other way too fast for my liking. But this one? They really made us work for it, and I was vibing with the tension. I think it was done really well, no filler scenes to slow it down.Now, the plot? Um... it was a bit of a mess. (Typical for this author, honestly.) Rhys suddenly being royalty? Not buying it. But the betrayal from Bridget’s assistants? That was believable. Still, the whole royal blood thing felt forced. I hate to say it, but the book didn’t deserve all the hype. Like, yeah, I enjoyed Bridget. Rhys was hot. The spice was great, but that was basically it. It’s getting a lot of praise, and while I enjoyed it, I don’t think it lives up to the hype everyone’s giving it. I expected something extraordinary.**The Side Characters**Ava was just... there. Totally forgettable, as expected. Every time Alex was mentioned, I was like *eye roll*—sorry not sorry. Jules, though? Always fun. And that scene with her disappearing with Josh at the end? 👀 Christian is the real star. He’s twisted, insane, and I’m hooked on his storyline. The way he was eyeing Stella at the end? Can’t wait for that drama to unfold. Christian and Stella? That\'s what I’m living for in this series.So yeah, overall, I’m torn. I loved Bridget and the slow-burn romance, but the plot was messy, and some of the hype feels overblown. Still, if you\'re here for hot characters, slow-burn tension, and a little bit of chaos, this one’s definitely worth the read. Just don’t expect a life-changing book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '2023:rhys, me puedes pedir que gatee cuando quieras.2021:yes yes yesnecesito maaaaasel tercer libro me emociona demasiado !!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Rhys Larsen🧎🏻\u200d♀️that’s it.

A Court of Mist and Fury (A Court of Thorns and Roses, #2)
",Sarah J. Maas,4.65,2471012,3686,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, New Adult, Fiction, Romantasy, Fae",626,03-05-2016,"The seductive and stunning #1 New York Times bestselling sequel to Sarah J. Maas's spellbinding A Court of Thorns and Roses .Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. Though she's now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.As her marriage to Tamlin approaches, Feyre's hollowness and nightmares consume her. She finds herself split into two different one who upholds her bargain with Rhysand, High Lord of the feared Night Court, and one who lives out her life in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While Feyre navigates a dark web of politics, passion, and dazzling power, a greater evil looms. She might just be the key to stopping it, but only if she can harness her harrowing gifts, heal her fractured soul, and decide how she wishes to shape her future-and the future of a world in turmoil.Bestselling author Sarah J. Maas's masterful storytelling brings this second book in her dazzling, sexy, action-packed series to new heights.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Rating: All the stars in the universe""I needed not to be dead when I agreed.”“You needed not to be alone.”I don\'t really know what to say in order to adequately express how stunningA Court of Mist and Furyis. How exquisitely beautiful. How slow-burningly sorrowful. How... joyous at the same time. I\'m at a lack of words for describing how it truly made mefeel-- because this book resonates with my soul and my heart and my mind so wonderfully, it just filled me with awe from within, leaving me drowning in an eternal swirl of emotions, a ruin because of a mere novel.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die,” he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.This book is a story aboutlifeandloveand every gray shade in between. A story about the bleak days and the lovely winds of change. A story about hard-fought happiness and soul-wrenching sacrifices. And a story about a girl who finds herself drifting away into the fields of nothingness only to discover the stars and moon and night sky pointing towards her glorious rebirth.Feyre, oh dear Feyre. I amso so proudof her and who she\'s become at the end of the novel. She\'s so exhilarating and vibrant and incredibly strong. But she was not like this in the beginning. The events in the previous book shredded her apart from the inside out, living only a shell of the brave young woman we cheered for. My heart ached for her. But she finds herself again -- her true self, her wild heart, her luminous spark of daring, fierce, brilliant dreams. And the heroine that emerges is coated with sheer determination, powerful bravery and astounding compassion.I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.I would not be weak, or helpless again.I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.I want to assure everyone that not one character,NO ONE, acts OOC. And besides Feyre, no one changes. You know what I\'m talking about -- the alpha-males vulturing around Feyre. ACoTaR only showed us bits and pieces, but we mustn\'t jump to the wrong conclusions about certain people especially since the depth of ACoTaR felt (at least to me) similar to a Vegas wedding after meeting a guy in the hotel lobby, whereasACoMaF was a reality check. Harsh and cruel and unyielding.This being said, I liked Tamlin. He was true to himself. Everything he does, he does out of love and of fear of losing Feyre. And we all know that people blinded by love can often make mistakes -- and Tam did. Many mistakes. A lack of understanding intoxicated him and an imperative need for control severed his perception. Paradoxically, we get to know him better even if he\'s not a present figure throughout the book. And perhaps, now that we\'ve seen more of his layers and facades... perhaps we see him in a much different light. He has issues and I truly believe Amarantha messed him up mentally -- nowhere near the trauma Feyre endured, but still a haunting scar imprinted on his demeanor. Regardless, do not mistake all I\'ve said as excuses in his defense, because they are not. They do not excuse his ultimate authority, his condescending attitude and his infuriatingly rash decisions for which he does need to suffer the consequences.I just cannot wait to see him get his ass handed to him by Feyre.“He did—does love me, Rhysand.”“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Rhysand, on the other hand, was the epitome ofdamn. I might even have a confession to make... He might...*gulp*... have overthrown Will Herondale and Dorian Havilliard as my favorite book boyfriend!!Rhys embodies the highest standards for fictional males. His bad-boy allure. His arrogance. His cunning mind. His elegance. His astounding power. But these are nothing compared to his internal beauty -- his selflessness, his nerve-wrecking intensity, his carefully crafted mask, his turmoil and his kindness. His self-doubt brought me to my knees, because he is such a precious cinnamon roll and he doesn\'t realize it. Andholy shithis past was just too much --I WAS (AM) AN EMOTIONAL MESS.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written?” Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I’d seen it. “I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince—the hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.”And you wanna know what?HE\'S A GODDAMN FEMINIST. If that doesn\'t make you fall in love with him head over heels, I don\'t know what will. Plus Rhys is basically the hottest fictional guy ever created (Darkling + Warner + Dorian = omg). WHY ISN\'T HE REAL???*sobs*“Tamlin won’t allow it.”“Tamlin isn’t your keeper, and you know it.”“I’m his subject, and he is my High Lord—”“You are no one’s subject.”***“Maybe it’d be a mercy to be ended—A broad hand gripped my face—gently enough not to hurt, but hard enough to make me look at him. “Don’t you ever think that,” Rhysand hissed, his eyes livid. “Not for one damned moment.”***""She wins,” Rhys breathed. “That bitch wins if you let yourself fall apart.""Lucien remains clever and intuitive and even though his relationship with our heroine gets stranded, his only flaw is undying, blind loyalty and I cannot fault him for that.Moving now onto more serious topics -- the new characters. We have quite a lot, but by far the loveliest ones are Rhysand\'s Inner Circle.They\'re squad goals. FierceMorrigan; strange and kickassAmren; sassy, arrogant and skilledCassian; reserved and observantAzriel. All these, plus Rhys, entangle a dynamic that createsa family. I loved them to bits. Secondary characters, yet so wonderfully nuanced, three-dimensional characters that gut you with their own stories and make you shed a tear at how much they love each other. Plus, they cracked me up on a constant basis. And the respect and unflinching support they have between them was all kinds ofwowandawwww.Okay. Enough with the stalling. Let\'s venture into dangerous territory akathe romance.*deep breath*I want to start by sayingthere is no love triangle-- there\'s onlya wonderful, all-consuming and healthyrelationship that evolves naturally until it reaches paramount heights. I was constantly plastered with a stupid, goofy grin on my face whenever this couple interacted or was simply in the same scene. What makes them absolutely beautiful in my perspective isthe mutual respect, honesty and supportthey have for each other -- it paints them with anempoweringand downright heartwarming glow. Their amazingfriendship, their sparkingchemistry, their hilariousbanterand their hot as helltensionhad me repeatedly blessing the gods for Maas.“He locked you up because he knew—the bastard knew what a treasure you are. That you are worth more than land or gold or jewels. He knew, and wanted to keep you all to himself.”***“I’m thinking,” he said, following the flick of my tongue over my bottom lip, “that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Besides those strong traits of their relationship, I need to mention the steaminess and sexiness and overallHOTNESS.Because this book? It\'s hot. Like black-in-the-middle-of-July-in-California-hot. NA, after all. You thought ACoTaR was hot?YOU THOUGHT WRONG-- prepare yourself for hyperventilating, fangirling and swooning, \'cause SJM\'s writing skills slay in those scenes.“I heard every word between you. I knew you could take care of yourself, and yet … ” He went back to his pie, swallowing a bite before continuing. “And yet I found myself deciding that if you took his hand, I would find a way to live with it. It would be your choice.”I sipped from my wine. “And if he had grabbed me?”There was nothing but uncompromising will in his eyes. “Then I would have torn apart the world to get you back.”Oh oh oh but there are some other ships that get my blood pumping even though they\'re not sailing -- YET THEY SHOULD. They totally should. Mozriel and Nessian embody pure awesomeness.And Elain and Lucien will be so interesting to see play out!What I enjoyed tremendously about this particular sequel is how it managed to expand the realm beyond its initial borders, in terms of world-building, depth and history. ACoTaR now seems like a small piece of a giant puzzle, the lovely but common retelling ofBeauty and the Beastpaling in comparison to ACoMaF which, while just teasing us with glimpses of the real deal that\'s to come, contained a sense of radiant and vastepicness.The most special and bewildering aspect is the lush and vivid portrayal of the Night Court. Enthralling and contradictory, it completely enraptures you with its seductive tone. So different from the Spring Court (and Summer Court which we get to visit!!). But I expected something disheartening and equally dark, and while this mysterious court has that vibe and then some, there is also such glorious light and normalcy and elegance that reside in its spectrum. The Court of Nightmares gave me goosebumps. The Court of Dreams, however, gave me breath and life. The book centers in Velaris andohmygod this city! I loved Velaris with all my being and if there ever was a fictional place or universe in which I\'d want to live, then Velaris and the Night Court are it.Plotwise, there isn\'t really much to say, honestly, besides the fact that the king of Hybern is the new big bad wolf (as expected) and he wants to bring chaos into this world. But his presence is subtle, his threat only looming on the horizon -- the finale will deal with him more. Yet we encounter intrigue and secrets and eye-opening side stories and tales that create the legacy of Prythan hand in hand with the world-building. It felt similar toHeir of Fire, a journey of healing rather than grueling war. However, as in HoF, the last few chapters left me breathless and white-knuckled as I gripped the book to read every single word.Betrayals, alliances, resurrections, magic and evil marvelously unraveled in an explosive punch, a mic drop of a sort.It leaves you craving more the very next instant.We\'ll see more Nesta and Elain and Tam and Lucien in the next book, that\'s for sure. But the stakes are so high and the game of hide and seek between friends and enemies so dangerous that I cannot help but be in a continual frenzy until the sequel. It\'s going to be as much of a masterpiece as this one, certainly.A Court of Mist and Furymade me want to re-read it the second I\'ve finished it -- and re-read again afterwards. It made me want to live in its universe. It made me want to be friends with the characters, tell them how much I adore them and just how precious they all are. It made me feel alive in so many ways that it also rendered me speechless.But you know where its absolute beauty resides? It\'s in the cleverness with which it was constructed. Sarah J. Maas outdid herself -- with the loose threads, with the vibe ofHades & Persephoneand with the countless clues and hints that begged for a re-read of ACoTaR in order to pick them up bit by bit. No one can say she changed her creation to her whim, because it was all carefully planned out, mapped out ever since the first page of the first installment.“You are my salvation, Feyre.”A Court of Mist and Furyis my newfavorite bookand I\'ll keep it close to my heart from now on. Enchanting, clever and masterfully written, it shattered my expectations and raised itself on a gold pedestal. I love it completely and I hope you\'ll do so too -- as fiercely as Feyre loves the night.On a chirpier note though, I\'ll go drown myself into a hell of a long book-slump because nothing,absolutely nothing can come close to this glorious book while its remnants shine so brightly in my mind.ENJOY! <3P.S.:My headcanon fanart for ACoMaF:My Night Court photoset is a bit spoilery, so here\'s theTumblr link.My ACoMaF inspired playlist --The Stars Who ListenListen here:8tracks;YouTube.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'HOLY FUCKING SHIT. HOLY. FUCKING. SHIT.A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.***CONTAINS A SHIT TON OF SPOILERS***REALLY, IF YOU HAVE NOT FINISHED THE BOOK YET, DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW.THIS BOOK IS WAAAAAAAY MORE THAN 5 STARS, IT\'S MORE LIKE 1000000000000000/5 STARS. I KNEW IT WAS GOING TO BE PERFECT BUT I DIDN\'T KNOW IT WAS GONNA BETHISPERFECT.To be completely honest with you guys, I have absolutely no idea where to start, so I\'m warning you, this is gonna be far from an actual review.May 3rd was the day I died.I ran to my mailbox, knowing what awaited me there. I opened it and saw the box, amazon prime tape all over it. I took it and ran back inside my house. I stared at the box and took a deep breath...THEN RIPPED THAT SHIT UP. I CLAWED AT IT, SHREDDING THE WHOLE FUCKING BOX IN THE PROCESS. I SAW THAT BLUE FUCKING COVER AND KNEW THAT MY LIFE WAS NEVER GONNA BE THE SAME. I TOOK THAT FUCKING BOOK AND TURNED THAT SHIT OVER. THE COVER WAS FUCKING BEAUTIFUL. SCREAMING LIKE I WAS BEING TORTURED IN THE DEEP PITS OF HELL, I RAN AND SAT MY ASS DOWN ON THE COUCH. I OPENED THAT SHIT UP AND READ TIL MY EYES BLED. DAMN STRAIGHT.So all I read in the first 40 pages or so was blah blah blah Tamlin blah blah blah Where\'s Rhys.And then the moment we\'ve been waiting for happened. The moment whereRHYSAND INTERRUPTS FEYRE\'S WEDDING TO BRING HER TO THE NIGHT COURT. FUCK YEAH.The Night Court is the most beautiful thing ever. Could it be any better? No. It was perfection. And when Rhys winnows with her there, Feyre\'s first instinct is to throw a shoe at him.THE ALL-POWERFUL, MOST FEARED HIGH LORD OF THE NIGHT COURT GOT HIT BY A SHOE.It was adorable.And Rhys helped teach Feyre how to read and it was the best thing ever. All the while training her on her new found powers. These powers came from the seven High Lords and Feyre has all of them.EVEN RHYS\'SFeyre became a very strong character in this book, Sarah knows how to work in that character development! She knew how to fight for herself and always wanted to be there to help in times of need. And the reason for leaving the Spring Court forever was because stupid Tamlin didn\'t let her go anywhere and practically made the estate Feyre\'s new prison cell. How symbolic. Remember that time Under the Mountain, Tamlin? When your ""beloved"" was trapped in that same cell for three whole months? How you didn\'t do anything about it and watched her rot? How on her last day Under the Mountain, you wanted to have sex with her instead of trying to free her? Ever think of those things Tamlin? Doesn\'t seem like it because now you\'ve recreated that same cell that\'s caused her so much trauma. Isn\'t he the greatest.When Feyre made the decision to stay at the Night Court with Rhys and the squad (who I adore so much by the way), I was so happy. Not just because that meant Rhys and Feyre time (whoo!), but because it showed how strong she\'s become and that she finally escaped the captivity of the Spring Court into the freedom of the Night Court. And she is a total bad ass.The Night Court squad is so awesome. We\'ve got Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel who I love all equally. They all have character depth, flaws, and pasts that we learn about. Mor\'s past was devastating and made me want to just give her the biggest hug. I also enjoyed amren a lot because she looks like she could kill you and will actually kill you. And Azriel and Cassian are also really fun to read about as well. They are all cinnamon rolls.Let me just say, I love it when the girl saves the guy. In this case, it was Feyre saving Rhysand. They were flying and Rhys was hit in the back with ash arrows and was captured and whipped. Now Feyre, she wasMAD.She winnowed and killed the guys torturing Rhys like the total boss she is and saved Rhys from death. I was seriously so scared for my baby.NOW IS THE TIME TO BRING IT UP GUYS. THE MOMENT WE\'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR. WE WANTED IT TO HAPPEN FOR SO LONG. AND NOW IT\'S OUT IN THE OPEN. READY THE CANON.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES.RHYSAND. AND. FEYRE. ARE. MATES.THE FANDOM RIGHT NOW.AND RHYS HAD DREAMS ABOUT FEYRE BEFORE HE EVEN MET HER. WHEN HE FIRST MET FEYRE HE HAD A SENSE THAT THEY WERE MATES. HE KNEW THE WHOLE TIME, AND IT BROUGHT MORE TEARS TO MY POOR EYES. IT ACTUALLY MAKES ME WANT TO REREAD A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES JUST TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VIEW ON IT. AND RHYSAND REALIZED HE LOVED FEYRE WHEN HE HELD THE DAGGER TO AMARANTHRA\'S NECK.RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE MATES AND EVERYTHING IS RIGHT IN THE WORLD.AND WHEN RHYS TOLD FEYRE EVERYTHING, (AND I MEAN EVERYTHING)...(LIKE REALLY EVERYTHING), I CRIED. IT WAS SOOOO.... I\'M SORRY I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS, BUT YOU PROBABLY FELT THE SAME THING. YOU KNOW.AND THE NIGHT OF STARFALL. OMG MY BABIES. THEY WERE AT THE BALCONY AND THEY WERE SHARING PERSONAL THINGS (I LIVE FOR THESE MOMENTS). AND THE ABSOLUTE MOST ADORABLE THING THAT HAPPENED WAS WHEN THEY BOTH WERE HIT IN THE FACE BY THE STARLIGHT AND LAUGHED. LAUGHED. AND SMILED SO MUCH. FEYRE HADN\'T SMILED LIKE THAT IN FOREVER. AND OH DEAR LORD SAVE ME, I\'M PICTURING THE GRIN RHYSAND GAVE FEYRE RIGHT NOW AND IT MAKES ME MEEEELLLLTTTT. I JUST SIMPLY CANNOT.Now, let\'s talk about the hottest scenes ever between my dear Rhys and Feyre.THEY WERE SO STEAMY AND I WAS FREAKING OUT THE WHOLE TIME. I DIDN\'T KNOW IF THIS WAS REAL LIFE OR NOT. AND THEY LASTED PAAAAAGGGGEESSS. A GLORIOUS AMOUNT OF PAGES. THESE WERE THE FELLOW STEAMY SCENES:COURT OF NIGHTMARES.THE CRAMPED BEDROOM.MATE REALIZATION. (THE BEST ONE)And Rhys is not who we expected him to be. He\'s sacrificed so much for his people like I can\'t even explain becauseHE SACRIFICED SO DAMN MUCH.And I seriously cried when he revealed all these things about himself.MAIN CAUSE OF MY EMOTIONAL TRAUMA RIGHT THERE.I could go on and on forever about the many many many precious Rhys and Feyre moments, but let\'s talk about that ending.Things were so perfect so far that I was getting scared. Scared that all that perfectness was going to be ripped away and I was going to be one emotional mess. And for a minute there, I was. You guys know what I\'m talking about.So Feyre and Rhysand acted like Feyre was under Rhysand\'s control the whole time so it made it seem like Feyre actually still loved Tamlin and that she wanted to go back with him. And then she wanted to make it seem more real. And I\'m like ""FEYRE IF YOU FUCKING TELL THE KING TO BREAK YOUR MATE BOND I SWEAR-"" And then she tells the king to break the mate bond. And Rhysand\'s screams just shattered my heart when he was about to. And shithead Tamlin\'s says ""Do it."".AND THE FUCKING KING OF HYBERN BROKE RHYS AND FEYRE\'S MATE BOND.I THOUGHT IT WAS OVER THEN AND THERE. I COMPLETELY LOST MY SHIT.BUT WAIT. IT\'S NOT OVER.RHYSAND AND FEYRE WERE ALSO ACTING THAT OUT TOO. THE MATE BOND WASN\'T BROKEN. I REPEAT, THE MATE BOND WAS NOT BROKEN. THE KING JUST BROKE THE BARGAIN WITHOUT REALIZING IT WASN\'T THE MATE BOND. THAT LOVE CANNOT BE BROKEN, ESPECIALLY RHYSAND AND FEYRE\'S. AND SO NOW THIS SETS UP THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD BOOK. FEYRE IS GOING TO SPY ON THE SPRING COURT AND SEND THE INFORMATION DOWN THE MATE BOND TO RHYS. YEAH FEYRE YOU GO GIRL.Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that Nesta and Elain were turned into High Fae. And Lucien is mated with Elain. Crazy, am I right?!AND FEYRE IS NOW HIGH LADY OF THE NIGHT COURT.I AM COMPLETELY SPEECHLESS AND AM STILL IN UTTER SHOCK AT HOW BEYOND AMAZINGLY PERFECT A COURT OF MIST AND FURY WAS. I CAN\'T EVEN PUT IT INTO WORDS. EVEN A GIF. I JUST-- WOW. YOU GUYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I\'M FEELING RIGHT NOW. RHYSAND AND FEYRE ARE EVERYTHING I EVER WANTED.THE THIRD BOOK SHOULD BE CALLED ""A COURT OF PAIN AND EMOTIONAL TRAUMA"" BECAUSE THAT\'S HOW IT\'S PROBABLY GONNA GO. HERE COMES THE YEAR LONG WAIT. I DON\'T THINK I\'LL SURVIVE WITHOUT IT LONG ENOUGH. I WANT IT SOOOOO BADLY!!!!!AND I\'M MEETING FUCKING SARAH J. MASS ON THE 14TH AT THE CHICAGO BOOK CON TO GET MY COPY OF ACOMAF SIGNED AND MEET HER IN THE PROCESS! I\'LL MOST LIKELY BE RENDERED SPEECHLESS JUST LIKE AFTER I FINISHED ACOMAF. I AM SERIOUSLY SO EXCITED.I WILL SAY IT AGAIN: A COURT OF MIST AND FURY IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ IN MY WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.""To the stars who listen-- and the dreams that are answered.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Instagram||Threads||Facebook||Amazon||TikTokI almost tossed this down in disgust five times while reading this book. I knew, going in, that it was going to be a massive act of revisionism with regard to Rhysand, the villain of the first book. And as someone who loves villains and thePersephone myththat could have been something I could have gotten behind under the right circumstances. But I wasn\'ttrulyprepared for the narrative gymnastics that this book would perform to try to redeem him without really making him do any legwork. By the end of the book, he\'s still a sleaze lord, only now he\'s a sad sleaze lord in leather pants who was actually the heroine\'s soulmate all along and an all around Nice Guy. Pop a fedora on his head and he\'d probably ""milady"" his way through the Night Court.Big yikes.The beginning of the book was great, and very much in keeping with ACoTaR. Feyre has PTSD (understandable) and so does Tamlin (also understandable) and they\'re trying to heal and find the same love for each other that was the fuel for Feyre to save him under the mountain in the first place. The passion between them in the beginning was great. Feyre\'s misgivings about ruling also made sense. I could even understand why Tamlin would want to be so overprotective. He felt like he had betrayed her in failing to keep her safe and was overcompensating for it in the worst way by essentially treating her like she was made out of glass.Enter Rhysand, who makes good on his bargain to take Feyre back to his court for seven days a month. He actually ruins Feyre\'s wedding, where she is about to get married to Tamlin but having a major case of cold feet and PTSD. He tells her that her wedding dress is ugly and tells her that she should thank him for saving her the effort of breaking things off, because he is *chef\'s kiss* a prince among men. *eye roll* He takes it upon himself to teach Feyre to read and write and is so shocked that she was allowed to be illiterate for so long... which was kind of weird to me, because I was pretty sure that TAMLIN was actually teaching her how to read in book one?? Maybe I\'m wrong, but I seem to remember Tamlin teaching her to read was a major part of his introduction as love interest.Also, apparently Feyre hates painting now and is totally upset that Tamlin gives her a set of paints as a present. Because how dare he get her something that she used to like but didn\'t tell him that she doesn\'t like anymore. How dare he not be a mind-reader like Rhysand who is a prince among men.Anyway, things between Tamlin and Feyre aren\'t so great when she gets back. She starts noticing that he\'s really controlling but they never really sit down and talk about it. She whines about it but never discusses anything with him... and yes, while his behavior isn\'t great, locking her in the tower is hardly the abusive act that Feyre milked for all it was worth. It was bad, yes, but it\'s not like Rhysand was free of faults (oh no, we\'ll be getting to that), and yet his past was wiped so clean it was practically sparkling, while Tamlin\'s smaller crimes are portrayed as the Greatest Wrongs in the History of Wrongs, and you would think he put her up in some kind of prison camp for all that she goes on about Tamlin locking her up and Rhysand freeing her. IT WAS SO ANNOYING.The ""mate"" thing is really just a neat excuse to forgo any groveling while also explaining this seeming switch mid-series between love interests. We learn that Rhysand sexually assaulted Feyre for her own good, to keep her angry so she wouldn\'t give up hope. WOW, WHAT A GREAT GUY. About 370-pages in, he finally brings up the assault and sort-of-but-not-really-apologizes and Feyre merely shrugs it off, despite the fact that in book one, everything he did was infuriating and traumatizing to her, and she HATED his guts and HATED him for parading her around and objectifying her in front of Rhysand, drugged her, mind raped her, and even made jokes about forcing herself on her, but yeah, Tamlin\'s the bad guy because he locked her in her room ONE TIME.It\'s kind of amazing, really, how eager Feyre was to throw Tamlin in the trash.Also, like Celaena/Aelin in THRONE OF GLASS, it isn\'t enough for Feyre to be a bad-ass fighter on her own terms, no. When she comes back with the gifts of the other Lords, she comes back with LITERALLY ALL OF THEIR POWERS, and she is so powerful that people are going to kill her just to keep her powers from manifesting. Because a heroine just isn\'t worth salt if she isn\'t the Queen of the Specialverse, I guess. Part of what made Feyre so endearing in book one is because she actually did have to struggle to succeed; here, everything is served to her on a silver platter.I skipped over most of the Night Court things... they were so boring.Of course, Tamlin has to become a traitor. Maas basically did to him what she did to Chaol and Dorian in THRONE OF GLASS. They both become terribad people so Rowan can show up and steal the scene with his earth-shattering orgasms. I guess maybe even the author realized that Tamlin didn\'t look that bad, so making him into a betrayer was necessary for giving Feyre a clean-cut reason to dump his ass without looking petty. Also, apparently he harbors a sexual assaulter in his court, because in this book we learn that YET ANOTHER WOMAN IN THIS BOOK tried to have her way with Rhys without his consent, and Tamlin just keeps her around... because he\'s the bad guy now.We\'re supposed to feel sorry for Rhysand because he was Amarantha\'s ""whore,"" and yes, I do feel sorry for him... Amarantha was awful... but that doesn\'t excuse his own abuse. ""This is for your own good"" is literally one of the go-to phrases of abusers. He was AWFUL in A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES and he never really grovels for it. He tells Feyre abouthisabuses while crying, but that\'s all about HIM. He provides plenty of reasons-- excuses-- about why he did what he did, but this serves more to brush off his actions than genuine contrition. I wouldn\'t even care if he became her love interest as the villain if he was actually KEPT as a villain, but it\'s like all that brutality gets a pass because he is, in fact, a nice guy. Also, the casual story about what basically serves as an allegory to genital mutilation in his mother\'s court was super disturbing and mentioned like once, but holy yikes-- his parents were fucked up, and I felt like that should have been unpacked more.Lastly... the mental illness rep. Some people apparently think it\'s great. No. I don\'t think it is. Love basically cures Feyre\'s ills. While it\'s true that being in an unhealthy relationship can exacerbate existing mental illnesses and cause ones you are predisposed to to manifest, being in a good relationship is not a cure. You don\'t lose your PTSD or whatever because the sex is good and you\'ve found your soul mate. That is a toxic trope in way too many romances, and I can\'t stand for it. ALSO, what about Tamlin\'s PTSD? This was also never really discussed. Does only Feyre get to behave irrationally and have freak outs? That\'s an unrealistic expectation to have, and her contribution to that toxic relationship was never even discussed... because of course, Feyre is perfect.On second thought, maybe she is perfect for Rhysand. They\'re both selfish trash people.One of the crowning moments in this book is Feyre saying NOBODY HAS SUFFERED OR GONE HUNGRY LIKE I HAVE while a few chapters before she was hating on Tamlin for literally tithing his people until they starve. I guess she\'s the High Lady of Virtue Signalling as well. Fuck the poor people if they don\'t give her an excuse to hate on Tamlin. I don\'t believe they\'re mentioned again.If you forget how perfect this couple is, Feyre and Rhysand will remind you 2342342 times why the two of them are the Faerie Jesuses Incarnate who died and prostituted themselves for your sins.This almost reads like bad fanfiction of the first book. I really don\'t feel like Rhyand and Feyre were destined to be together from the beginning. I felt like maybe Maas initially planned on a love triangle but maybe thought Rhysand was too rough around the edges, and so worked double-time trying to find reasons to excuse all of his behavior and make him supes enamored with the heroine.The greatest death in this series wasn\'t Junian\'s or Amarantha\'s... it was Tamlin\'s character.It isn\'t even like Rhysand is perfect in this book. His flirting is literally saying things to Feyre that most men would get slapped for. He talks to her like one of those sexist asshats inMadmen. He\'s constantly talking about her appearance in a creepy way, and helaughswhen she\'s upset that he used her as bait for the Attor. Even their bargain, which ended up allowing him to read her mind, was done without consent, and he certainly doesn\'t ask for consent every time he reads her mind. At one point, he even says that he could rip her mind apart if he wanted. It\'s almost like this book was written out with the intention of having him still be the villain and Maas changed her mind halfway through.I really couldn\'t stand this book.Rhysand and Rowan are literally the same person, and their ""development"" with the heroine follows the same trajectory. It\'s not the worst book I\'ve read, and it\'s not even the worst Maas book I\'ve ever read, butI will never for the life of me understand why this series is so popular, or why some people who eagerly condemn other books for being problematic seem so eager to forgive or ignore the flaws in this one.Your mileage may vary.1 to 1.5 stars'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'When I finished this book,the mountains trembled.*Do I need to remind you to be civil?

I thought so.Oh well.I’m going to say this just once: it’s calledmanipulation.Now look at me, Maas. Do I look like a reader who enjoys being manipulated to you?No? Why,I thought so.To all those who still have to start this series and are intentioned to:don’t readA Court of Thornes and Roses. Spoil yourself a little of what happens there andstart with this one. Because -and this is the truly sad thing, as someone else said before me-A Court of Mist and Furycould even be enjoyable if the first book had not happened before.•I won’t go so far as to say that what we have here is a case of lack of “show” and an excess of “tell”, because the first chapters do show that Tamlin, whether for some PTSD or because he has always been a scumbag, undeniably acts like the worst man on the planet. I am even willing to forgive howcaricaturalhis behaviour appears. But, throughout the book, every occasion is a good occasion to throw in a comment tooverturncompletely also all the positive parts of him that are showed in the first book.(In this regard, I should say that inA Court of Thornes and RosesI did not care for Tamlin in any way, so I am not speaking out of frustrated adoration.)In this scenario, Tamlin is the epitome of all evil, while Rhys, of course, the epitome of all good: Tamlin cares for hierarchy, Rhys cares for family and nothing more (ugh); Tamlin wants her caged, Rhys want her free; as it turns out,it was Tamlin’s betrayal to begin the feud between his family and Rhys’s, and so on. I am not in any way saying that a man shouldn’t give freedom to his woman (it’s not that he should;he must, uncompromisingly), or that a plot-twist like the one I mentioned isn’t a good turn of events, even in terms of characterization, but everything is just sostereotypicalandtriteandsickly sweet.All of this,in the name of a ship. I think Maas should understand that falling out of love is just as normal as falling in. People fall out of love for normal reasons even if their exes don’t suddenly turn into maniacs.I am sick of this device, courtesy ofQueen of Shadows, and I don’t need the new love interest to be pushed on me: I am perfectly able to decide for myself.•I’ve seen some reviews in which these two characters are described as complex and multifaceted on the basis of their role reversal. Allow me to say that, in my opinion,nothing about them, in this book, is complex nor controversial.Maas did nothing more than switch their places and their personalities with them: Tamlin was the good one and turns out to be the villain; Rhysand was the villain (somehow, and indeed the Rhysand of the first book is the one I can honestly call intriguing) and now he is nothing short of a Fae Prince Charming.Simple as that.Besides,I liked Rhysandin this book, butI deeply missed the more wicked, morally grey part of himthat we saw Under the Mountain. He’s hot, sure, but he also comes off asflatand, at times,pathetic.•It was a dick moveto lock Feure up in the mansion, yes. And yet, I can’t wrap my mind around Feyre’s fickleness, considering thattwo chapter latershe says this:“I\'m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing-thing? Now he’s a thing?-that showed me a hint of kindness and safety. And I\'m thinking maybe he knew that- maybe not actively, but maybe he wanted to be that person for someone. And maybe that worked for who I was before. Maybe it doesn\'t work for who- what I am now.""She hadevery rightto leave the mansion and let him stew for a while, but if that is the result of months and months of undying love, well. He stopped being worth of her love maybe, but I don’t think she fought for it that hard either, especially if he really was dealing with some PTSD. I think love is also about trying to fight for the other person even when they don’t seem to fight for us, to give them time, to give them chances, even though at one point we have to stop.It just would have been nicer and more enjoyable if Feyre’s affection’s shift hadn’t been so swift, that’s it.•All the contradictions. Feyre leave her abusive boyfriend, but then falls in the arms of a man who breaks every bone of a guy who called her names. Uh-uh. And if you say “He did that because he called her ‘whore’, and he’d been called whore too, and thetrauma”, I say: how do you know Tamlin’s behaviour wasn’t due to his trauma too. Maybe he just needed time. But it’s okay if it’s Rhysand that does that because epitome-of-perfection, remember?Hisbeing all possessive is okay. He can say things like “She’s mine” and snarl at people who so much as look at her. And don’t get me started on indecent exposure.•Thenew charactersare all nice and pretty and invariably haunted by a dark dark past. It’s nice to read about them and to witness their banters, but they don’t stand out as particularly well-written or sophisticated.•Theplotis evenweakerthan Maas’s usual. And contrary to what I usually do, I’ll sum it up for you: Feyre flees. TheMy Little Ponies gang- ops. I meant the Court of Dreams’ defenders (I know, the ponies were cooler) look for Things. Which do Stuff. Precisely, destroy Taran’s Black Cauldron and defeat The Horned King, minus the fluffy Gurgi.Well, wrong story, but that\'s basically what happens.In more than 600 pages.•People purr. Normal cats, thank God, ordinarily talk like freaking civilized beings.•The first timeRhysand and Feyre have sex and he climaxes, the mountains tremble. I refuse to comment on this thing, and if it was me who had written such embarrassing idiocy, I would be hiding my head under the sand. Moreover, allthe sex scenesare verycheesy,dramaticandover-written.•Lucien andElain’s mating bond. I swear on my heart I have never, ever read anything more ridiculous than this scene (oh, no, wait: the mountains). The passage from normal, rational person to mad caveman takes less time than a spark to burn. I almost expected he started hissing “My preciousss”.•And yet,I enjoyed it, or better, I enjoyedRhys,Rhys, his long, sappy, tearydeclaration/explanation(I have a thing for this trope; it could have been a thousand times worse than it actually is, and still I would\'ve loved it. I am such a softie, I know. My fault), theending, andRhys. The other things I pretty much despised. I also appreciate the fact that at least the author tried –and at some length, I think, even succeeded a tiny bit- to conceive a scenario in which Rhys’s cuddliness actually makes some sense.I still prefer him wicked.➽ To sum it up, what can I say? I read it with with ease because of an extremely fluent, even though not particularly sophisticated, writing style, and, as we all know, idiocies and mushy stuff can also be enjoyable, and truly, this book take the concept ofguilty pleasureto a whole new level. Nonetheless, I am sorry, but I can\'t overcome theirritationthat Maas\'s little games cause in me. She used the same lame and unprofessional trick twice now; my trust in her is gone, and I\'m wondering if we should expect a third time too.EDIT29/03/16: Ok, so I read the excerpt -as usual, unforgivably late, but this time the delay is due to the fact that I didn\'t know whether to read it or not.

I AM SCARED. I\'m totally open to the whole Feyre/Rhys thing, but I love Tamlin so much and I don\'t want him to be ruined by Sarah J. Maas! Can someone please tell her that she can make us love a character without ruining another character?Because really, I ship Feyre and Tamlin, but I will not be mad if SJM handles Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s relationship with cleverness.PLEASE SJM, DON\'T RUIN TAMLIN....And of course, WHAT DID SJM DO? RUIN TAMLIN!I tried to write my review without major plot spoilers, but there will be some minor spoilers about how the characters were handled. And warning: my emotions over this book are a mess, you\'ll se how contrary they are!Anyway... let me begin:OH, I was mad! I was so angry when I started reading this book, because it is in the first chapter that you notice that Tamlin has changed and not for good. Now he\'s an asshole. He\'s insensitive and controlling, I couldn\'t stand him! So congrats, SJM, you made me despise my (now former) favorite character in this series.I read a few reviews that said that Tamlin was always like that (a possessive piece of shit), but NO. HE WASN\'T! He was caring and protective, not a control freak. I feel that Tamlin changed because of everything that happened with Amarantha. Everyone comments on how Feyre had PTSD and Tamlin didn\'t try to understand her, but I think Tamlin also had PTSD. What he went through with Amarantha (and with almost losing Feyre) had a huge toll in him. I can accept that he changed because of that, but no one acknowledges it, not the readers, not Feyre, not even SJM.So that must mean that he just changed because he\'s an asshole (I\'m not buying it).My problem is that SJM wanted to force Rhysand on us, like she wanted to force Rowan on us in her Throne of Glass series. Excuse me, miss, but I don\'t need the love interest to be pushed on me. I can decide by myself. And the thing is... I FELL IN LOVE WITH RHYS IN THIS BOOK! And I think I would\'ve fallen for him even if Tamlin hadn\'t been the piece of shit he was.Before this book, I couldn\'t imagine any possible reason that would make Feyre leave Tamlin and fall for Rhys. Not after everything she went through to save Tam, he was the love of her life and her feelings for him were genuine. But then of course, the author put a lot of effort in ruining Tamlin, just so Feyre could fall out of love. What SJM doesn\'t seem to understand is that falling out of love is normal. It\'s perfectly fine. You don\'t have to turn a character into a bad guy for that to happen. Sarah turned Tam into a villain, and that was not necessary.I also hated the comparisons Feyre was always making between Rhys and Tam, so frustrating! They were so obviously put there only to make sure that the reader understood that Tamlin was evil and Rhysand was good:-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me go anywhere. But Rhys lets me do anything I want!""-""Ugh, I had my nightmares and Tamlin never woke up to confort me. But Rhys is always there for me when that happens!""-""Ugh, Tamlin only cares about hierarchy. But Rhys cares about family and about his people!""-""Ugh, Tamlin doesn\'t let me enter to his room. But of course Rhys invites me to his!""...I MEAN, SERIOUSLY? We can notice that by ourselves, but Feyre kept comparing and comparing during the whole book.Have you read the Shatter Me series? It was as if Feyre was Juliette, Tamlin was Adam and Rhysand was Warner... the very same pattern! First Tamlin was a cinnamon roll and suddenly he becomes a bad guy who only thinks about himself and is obsessed with Feyre. And Rhys was the evil guy in the first book but then you discover that he had really good reasons to do everything he did, and he\'s a good guy incapable of commiting any evil. Gosh, I really liked Tamlin, but now I simply can\'t stand him. SJM succeeded!And I had other issues with this book... but that was my main one. I\'m afraid this has become the modus-operandi of SJM.Let me talk about those other issues... starting with Rhys. His character really intrigued me in the first installment of this series, he seemed evil, and I knew there was more in him than what he let us see. I knew he had his reasons to act the way he did, and of course I wanted to know why. BUT THIS WAS JUST RIDICULOUS. He\'s not justnot evil, he istoogood, bordering in perfection. He\'s a saint, he\'s ""Saint Rhys"". There is too much goodness in him. He\'s also the ""most powerful Fae ever born"", see? It\'s unnatural to be that perfect.Another issue was that Rhys seems to be the only High Lord that cares about peace and prosperity. He\'s literally the only one trying to stop the King. The other High Lords don\'t care about humans! The other High Lords are stupid! I feel like SJM did this just to add more perfection to Rhysand\'s character: Obviously he\'s the only considerate Fae that cares about the poor humans, the other High Lords are nothing compared to him!Now let\'s go to the other side of my review (this will be drastic): Despite eveything, I LOVE RHYS SO MUCH! UGH, SARAH! You did it, you made me fall in love with him! Maybe it\'s his good nature. Maybe it\'s his perfection. Maybe it\'s because he reminds me of Warner. I don\'t care anymore... I\'m just really rooting for him. I don\'t know how Sarah does it. Even with everything that bothers me about his character, I couldn\'t help falling for him.And it is rare when I change my ship in a series, but I did in this one because there\'s no way I\'d still ship Feyre and Tamlin after everything that happened in this book (which is sad, because I really shipped them in the first book). Now I can only say that I ship Feyre and Rhys SO. MUCH. Their relationship development was beautiful, everything they went through made their love more real, made it stronger. There is no love triangle here, there are no teams, there are simply Feyre and Rhys and I NEED them to be together.There were only two things I didn\'t like about their relationship. 1)The whole: I DREAMT ABOUT YOU BEFORE I MET YOU....Cliché, cliché, cliché. 2) The ""YOU ARE MINE"" parts. I mean, Feyre left Tamlin because he was possesive and controlling, but all those ""you are mine"" are not exactly different, right? I don\'t like that kind of love. It should not be about belonging to someone, it should be about belonging together.I also love Cassian and Azriel. Everything that happened at the end with them made me a sobbing mess! I just hope Cassian recovershis poor wings!, because if not, I\'ll just go to a corner and cry forever.Now let\'s talk about Feyre. Sometimes she infuriated me because of all the comparisons she made and because she was always complaining about Tamlin not trying to understand her, but she didn\'t really try to understand him, either. Sometimes she was really unfair with himExcept when he locked her up, I would\'ve done the same thing Feyre did. AND NO, I don\'t want them back together (NEVER), it\'s just that she made me really mad sometimes. But in contrast, I think she really grew as a character in this book, she blew me away! The scene with the water wolves was AMAZING. AlsoI cried when the evil creatures attacked Velaris! Ugh, stupid queens!!!...I couldn\'t stand it, it was painful to read. But back to Feyre, I like the directon her character is going.I can\'t wait to read the next installment! I know Tamlin doesn\'t have a chance of forgiveness (I myself can\'t ever forgive him), but I\'d like to see redemption in Lucien, he\'s a character with great potential and in this book he was just too weak.The world building was great, a total A+! I\'m still a little confused about the whole Jurian ordeal, but I hope he gets killed soon :). All in all, this book was GREAT, I think that maybe it was better than the first one, and that\'s saying a lot, because I loved ACOTAR. But since I had way too much issues with it, I could not give it 5 stars. I don\'t know how Sarah does it... she makes me love her and hate her in every book she writes! But it\'s more love than hate, I am SJM trash. She\'s QUEEN.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I've never been thismanipulatedin my life.I was stripped off my free will until there was only a shell left behind, a puppet complying with her master's whim. This is the most vulgar thingSarah J. Maascould do.Allow me to elaborate.•In order to be candid, I have to admit thatI enjoyedA Court of Mist and Furymore than I expected, and found some redeeming traits that prevented me from rating it lower. However, I can't hide my rage and utter disappointment sinceeverything we read inA Court of Thorns and Rosesvanished into thin air. Remember the sweet love story between Tamlin and Feyre that defied immortal tyrants and resulted in great sacrifices in the name of their love? Well, forget about it. We were warned that this would be aHades and Persephone retelling, meaning the romantic relationship between Feyre and Rhysand would be inevitable. The way, though, Sarah handled the transition wasfeebleandinfuriatingto say the least. I don't think there has ever been a character moremistreatedthan Tamlin, with Lucien following suit. We get it, Sarah cares about her precious baby Rhysand, but her real talent as an author would be to make me choose him because I found something unique in him,not because she forced him down my throat. Tamlin's inexcusable behaviour suffocated Feyre, and I felt drowning and suffocating along with her. Since I couldn't possibly wish for her to stay in a mentally abusive relationship, Rhysand was the deus ex machina, the only one to save the damsel in distress, given that her friends abandoned her and her fiance suffered from split personality. Sarah dangled Rhysand in front of me, and every reader, sayingpick him pick him pick him. She had Tamlin and Rhysand facingidenticalsituations, only for Tamlin to do the wrong thing while precious Rhysand was the impersonation of right, of all that's good in the world. Tamlin locked Feyre? Rhysand set her free. Tamlin forbid Feyre from participating in his activities? Rhysand would always have her by his side. Tamlin extinguished the fire burning in Feyre and left her a hollow version of herself? Rhysand fueled that fire, and so on, so on. Now, I've been on the losing side of a triangle before, but always both love interests had some good qualities. In this case, though, Sarah served you the answer on a silver platter by annihilating the opponent and erasing everything that made the relationship between Feyre and Tamlin good and healthy. Rhysand was always sothoughtfulandconsiderateand knew what Feyre needed, he was her salvation. Of course he was, there was afreaking magic bondbetween them that allowed him to read her thoughts. Even the lesser fae servant in the Day Court would understand her needs if they were bonded. In every chapter she would chantRhysand is so gorgeous,Rhysand is so sexy,Rhysand is the most powerful High Lord in the history of Prythianyada yada.We.Get.It.Don't even get me started on the repetition of the wordmate, I rolled my eyes so many times I fear I might have a permanent problem.•Lucien losing his backbone and Tamlin turning into a psycopath a-hole were not the only character mistreatments, though.Rhysand was the victim of his own creator's adoration.In order to make him the perfect match for Feyre, she made himtoo perfect. Gone is the wicked, morally grey, complex character that intrigued us inA Court of Thorns and Roses. While unveilingthisRhysand, instead of finding shadows and darkness and lust for power, we found asappyand fluffy bear asking for love and affection. Everything he did was out oflovefor his friends, for Feyre and his country, and I fail to accept his reasoning behind his actions Under the Mountain. If you don't want the villain to know how you feel about Feyre, you can simply ignore her. But no, why not drug her, grop her while drugged and humiliate her instead?•Now let's get to the relationship between Feyre and Rhysand. For more than the first half of the book I liked them, with their banters and flirtation and the pent-up tension. But from attraction and friendship Feyre suddenly jumped to declarations of love and thenmountains trembledand she startedglowingand their sex scenes varied between steamy to cringe-worthy and more eye-rolling ensued (I seriously need to see an ophthalmologist).•Plotwise, I can't help but notice that some things were veryconvenient. You suspect the King of Hybern is preparing for war? Let's ask the monstrous ancient creature, who in the span of five minutes will give us all the answers, including the means to defeat the King and the exact location of the weapons to nullify his powers. Wanna convince the mortal queens to give you what you need? Write a mushy letter about your love for Feyre. The result is guaranteed. I mean, really?•Why three stars then, you may wonder. Well,I became very fond of the secondary characters. Mor, Azriel, Cassian and the ultimate Queen, Amren, were funny and caring and loyal, and I was actually more invested in their stories (which, to be honest, were all sob stories). I also enjoyed Sarah'slush descriptions, you could feel and breathe and walk the streets of Velaris, and the Summer Court. But most importantly, I admire the way Feyre's trauma from her experiences Under the Mountain was depicted. The guilt, the sorrow, the self-loathing were tangible, and the healing was slow and realistic. Her wounds would be there, and she learned to live with them. Feyre became a strong woman who embraced her gifts, her powers, her sensuality and ferociously claimed her place alongside men. She rose from her ashes.“When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.”•A Court of Mist and Furyhad great potential, but I can't say I loved it. I'm partially sad because I lost some of my respect for Sarah, for shredding to pieces the characters I loved only to show her own favorites are better. I don't know whether I'll readA Court of Wings and Ruin. Before the last chapters it was a big no, but that final confrontation was the book's highlight for me and now I'm considering to dwelve into the third instalment to find out the end of this story-arc.To all my friends who loved this book, and I know there are many of you, please don't be harsh on me.

What kind of fucked up sadistic witchy ritual is this for you?You annihilate me with your cruel imagination. And because I’m a masochist, I love it. Keep going queen, I love this kind of pain.So, I couldn’t have picked a better time to read this but the quarantine time; all I did all day was reading this; I was being transported to this amazing world that I want to be part of right now – the Night Court is my eternal home from now on.“Stay here for however long you want. Stay here forever, if you feel like it.”It helped my mental health so much I am at a lack of words to express my gratitude.When I was younger, I used to read a lot of mythological stories and even though the Greek mythology confused the hell out of me, I had this fascination for some badass ladies. Amongst them were Persephone and her story. Yes, my cheesy heart loved that, okay?Persephone was the Bride of Spring, but she was stolen by the God of the Underworld – the terrible Hades – because he was head-over-heels in love with her. But she hated him with all her being until…she didn’t anymore. She learned to love his weird-ass too until he became her husband.If this isn’t the literary world’s foundation for their enemies-to-lovers theme, then I don’t know what this is, I give up.Well, this is the exact thing that happens inA Court of Mist and Fury. Rhys gets to be Hades (duh, obvy!) and Feyre is our darling Persephone. My brain started producing serotonin once again because of that tiny little fact some now happy beyond compare.This book is a love statement. Falling in love – slowly, truly, deeply, madly in love. And hard. But heart-crying beautiful. And it is not only about two beautiful creatures learning how to love each other and all the states they get through to find that love.This book teaches of how to fall in love with beautiful people, beautiful faces, beautiful minds and beautiful souls. And most importantly, how to fall in love with yourself. How to cherish everything you get to have in order to know how to soothe your life and spirit.“But then she snapped your neck.”Tears rolled down his face.“And I felt you die”, he whispered.Tears were sliding down my own cheeks.“And this beautiful, wonderful thing that had come into my life, this gift from the Cauldron…It was gone.”Don’t get confused though. This is still a Maas work of art and thus it is still very, very extremely hot. I can’t manage to launch into an explanation of how hot this book is because it is on fire, okay? And with this, SJM makes out of this book a full emotional experience (an emotional roller coaster better said but oh well).All of my favourite characters from this series make an appearance in this book. If you thought you loved the characters you encountered in the first book, then wait to be blown away by the apparition of the Inner Circle. They’re precious, deadly soft babies that I would want nothing more in life for them but to be fed, warm, cuddled and loved.-Cassianis the ruffian of my heart, he’s big and loud and gives off this feeling that he’ll keep you happy and safe no matter what; just love him so much;-Azrielis the baby-bat-guardian-angel of my soul whom I love so much and all I want to do in life is hug him and feed him and protect him from everything and everyone;-Amrenis a scary old bitch whom I love for the simple fact that she doesn’t seem to give a fuck about anyone but she’ll be ready to defend her friends if it comes to it;-Moris my girl-crush of this series and sometimes I think she’ll be my ultimate wine-drinking bestie; I love her to death;“A queen – a queen who bowed to no one, a queen who had faced them all down and triumphed. A queen who owned her body, her life, her destiny and never apologized for it.”All those weirdos are like a big, fat present for me, wrapped up in colourful paper and with a bow tied on top. I don’t know how I managed to go on with my life before I learned about their existence.Now, moving on to more serious, adult-like topics, I want to confess one thing: this book is extremely sensual. It really goes places and I went with it like in trance. The level of sexiness explored here is so intense that it could be made a masterpiece of sensually falling in love. And this is mainly because ofRhys.In this book, I honestly cared more about Rhys than I cared about all of the characters inA Court of Thorns and Roses. He is the sexiest thing I’ve ever encountered in my life and with this, I have discovered, he’s my type of man, no questions asked.“I have known many High Lords. Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”It feels like he’s having his own personalised gravitational system and we simply happen to fly around like thebăgători-de-seamăthat we are, if I’m allowed to express myself as Romanian as possible.Rhysand and Feyre's falling in love journey is one of the most beautiful love stories this world could read about. It is so warm, but also so crushing. I love it. It’s like a most beautifully painted love dream.By the end ofthis– *vaguely gesturing towards everything ACOMAF is*– I felt tired, hurt and blurry-sighted. And truth be said, a bitsobby(a bit more). I’ve been hurt to my core.But I loved this book so much, honestly. And I’m thankful for the fact that it exists for me to read it.“We were a song that had been sung from the very first ember of light in the world.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '❝I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.

Tamed.❞A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn\'t hyped up like there\'s no tomorrow. It was the first book I\'ve read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven\'t picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it\'s been released. That\'s just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn\'t say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas\'s books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn\'t worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn\'t written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn\'t some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn\'t going to happen. These two people that survived weren\'t the same people that were Under the Mountain. They\'re relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre\'s own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don\'t acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn\'t protect her the way he wanted and he didn\'t fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she\'s being suffocated. It still doesn\'t excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he\'s just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He\'s just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he\'s kept, and the sacrifices he\'s made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I\'m not completely sure if I\'m 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would\'ve been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn\'t get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I\'m slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can\'t handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.I was a survivor, and I was strong.Oh damn. That was so unexpectedly good. And to think I almost didn\'t take a chance on this after not loving the first book...So, here it is: I present to you7 reasons why this book is a million times better thanA Court of Thorns and Roses.1) Less romance.Oh, don\'t worry, there\'s romance. There\'slusty, slow-build, flirtatious romancethat somehow manages to be completely absent from the first book, even though romance was more central to the plot. But there\'s also so many other things here. It\'s a fantasy with romantic elements, not the other way around.I always say I tend to become more invested in love stories when they\'re subplots and the book itself is not actuallyaboutthe love story. I like it when the characters come together around and between all the rest of the action and drama. That\'s what\'s happening here. Because there is a whole shitstorm of other things going on - which, by the way, has led tobetter world-building, more exciting action and reveals, and a fascinating overarching story.2) Feyre\'s growth and development.And, in fact, the growth and development of many characters. Maas spends some quality time on character histories and backstory to strengthen our understanding of them. I absolutely love it when characters show realistic growth over time and I think that\'s especially important with Feyre here.Feyre is not the character she was duringA Court of Thorns and Roses. How could she be after the events of that book? Naturally, she has changed and found that her needs and aspirations have changed too. Once upon a time, back when she was weak and starving, she longed for a strong protector like Tamlin. Now she is strong, and she needs freedom to train her newfound strengths.3) I hate Tamlin.Honestly, if you happen to be a diehard Tamlin fan, I can see this book being a huge disappointment. Luckily for me, I pretty much despised him. He\'s never been anything but apretty-faced control freak. I\'m glad Feyre has seen that and rebelled against it.I should warn you that Tamlin is absent for about 70-80% of this book. And that was just fine by me!4) I love Rhysand.I foresee the ""oh no, it\'s a love triangle"" comments rolling in, but I really don\'t think it is. I actually think this is a great book aboutgrowing up and discovering that you\'re a different personwho longs for different things. I don\'t get the sense that Maas is trying to play out the Tamlin/Feyre/Rhysand angst; she is merely showing a young woman having a change of heart.AND can we just talk about how much better Rhysand is. There\'s all the superficial stuff like he\'sexciting, flirty, dangerousand I love the story behind him. He\'s more fun than Tamlin and I like fun. His banter is wonderful. But I\'m also talking about a more important level. Rhysand is, despite being the ""bad boy"", thoughtful and selfless. He doesn\'t want to stifle Feyre\'s strength and lock her away for her own protection - he wants her at his side, an equal, a partner in crime. And I love that so much.I like men who see value in strong women.5) Less sexual.I\'m sorry, you horny readers, but I just need to put this out there:I really dislike Maas\' sex scenes. Maybe Tamlin had something to do with it but, in general, I think they\'re overwritten and melodramatic. I also think she does a lot of ""telling"" you that it\'s hot, instead of ""showing"" how it is, which is a common writing mistake, but is far worse when in a sex scene. It\'s unconvincing.And by ""overwritten"", I mean that she describes kissing as ""branding"", thrusts as ""breaking"", and sex moans as ""prayers"". Literally none of those things are sexy. She gets the flirtations and banter right - that bit is hotter than the actual sex - but I start to cringe when the clothes come off.A brush of his tongue against the seam of my lips had me opening fully for him, and he swept in, claiming me, branding me.Also, is it really necessary for the male characters to ""growl in approval"" during sex? Not just once - and arguably one growl is one too many - but several times. I\'m supposed to be fanning myself with desire and all I can think about isRoy Orbison\'s Pretty Woman.Mercy. Rawr.6) New characters.A Court of Mist and Furyintroduces many new characters, and the difference between this book and the first is that I found them all memorable, not just the main three characters. Maas has definitely not neglected her characterization and character detailing here. Everyone who comes in and out of the novel has an important purpose, is fleshed out with personality and history, and makes an impact.My favourite was Amren, but I also loved Cassian and Azriel. Our brief introductions to the Bone Carver and the Weaver were highlights too.7) The ending.Take note: this is how to ensure your reader needs to get their hands on the next book. It\'s not a cliffhanger, but it is still EVIL. In the best possible way. I loved everything about it. It\'s the kind of emotional high that leaves you somewhere between wide-eyed horror and smiling gleefully.How will I last a whole year?Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube|Store'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well, well, well. How the turns have tabled.ACOTAR was, uh...not my favorite book in the world.But there are no words to describe how much better ACOMAF is.All the problems I had with the first book were fixed. The story got bigger and more epic. The romance improved dramatically. And I fell in love with all the characters.This review has spoilers for the first book. Spoilers for ACOMAF will be boxed off with siren emojis (🚨).After the events Under the Mountain, Feyre is understandably traumatized. She saved Tamlin and the Spring Court at the cost of her own mental health. She had to kill innocent Fae to save him. And now she can\'t look at the color red without getting flashbacks. She wakes up every night to throw up.And Tamlin isn\'t helping.He\'s extremely protective of her after Amarantha killed her, even though Feyre was brought back stronger than ever as a High Fae. He doesn\'t allow her to talk to her family or to leave Spring Court land. He goes as far as to lock her in the house so she won\'t try to help the recovery effort in Prythian.And that\'s when she breaks. She calls out for anyone to save her, and Rhysand hears her through the bond, taking her to the Night Court to ride out the storm. But along the way, she realizes that she is more than a figurehead. She has powers, given to her by the High Lords when her body was remade. This book is essentially Feyre\'s journey to finding and accepting herself with Rhysand\'s help.Rhysand, High Lord of the Night Court, is not as he seems. In ACOTAR, we saw the facade he put on so Amarantha didn\'t get suspicious. But the real Rhys is a haunted, traumatized character who hates himself and feels worthless. He\'s exactly like Feyre. An excuse for Rhysand\'s past behavior is given, and it actually makes sense.Their journey to discovering themselves is beautiful, touching, and heartbreaking. And while I do hate Tamlin for being so heartless to Feyre, I can see where he\'s coming from and I don\'t think we should treat him like a villain.He\'s protective of Feyre because he saw her die, and he\'s absolutely terrified of that happening again. So he protects her the only way he knows how--by shutting her inside and not letting anyone see her. And it drives Feyre mad. I think there should have been a Tamlin redemption arc, and I really want to see Tamlin recovering from his PTSD as well. Because they\'re both suffering and they both deserve help. I don\'t want Tamlin to become the villain.However, the signs of emotional abuse and possible physical abuse are clearly evident.- Claws come out whenever Feyre confronts him- Makes her PTSD worse by locking her inside, giving her flashbacks to Under the Mountain- Doesn\'t take her opinions seriously- Doesn\'t listen to her, or kisses her or something to make her shut up- Gives her no responsibilitiesThe mental health rep was outstanding. Tamlin\'s rep was kind of harmful, but Feyre\'s was so raw and emotional and real.She didn\'t recover from her trauma because of love.She recovered because of friendship, and because people actually listened to her and took her seriously. Love was just a side effect.It\'s really the little things that helped. Feyre comforting Rhys during his nightmares and realizing that they were alike. Mor wearing blue instead of her favorite color (red) when she first meets Feyre. The Court of Dreams giving Feyre time to recover when she has a panic attack.The one thing I think this book needs is more diversity. Everyone was white except for this one guy that showed up for two chapters. The caucacity.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD🚨🚨🚨I did not like Rhysand\'s character after Feyre discovered the mating bond.This may have something to do with the fact that I don\'t like the idea of ""mates."" They\'re essentially soulmates, if you\'re not familiar with SJM. I always felt uncomfortable with the overprotectiveness that comes with the term and the kind of animalistic ring to the word itself.I actually really, really loved Rhys\'s character before he and Feyre were mates. He was so suave and intelligent and witty. That is, until the mating bond snapped into place. And then he was insanely overprotective and I just don\'t like that in a character.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨Another rap, because why not.

I just want to fill this review up with the heart-eye emojis.Minor spoilers will be included. You've been warned.This book is incredible. This book is important. But before I get to that, this book was a massive, gigantic improvement on ACOTAR. They're not even the same two books. Or they are, but ACOMAF elevated this series to what it deserved and needed to be.The world was epic, detailed and grand and I never wanted to leave. Everything about it clicked. I was absolutely transported into a world that I became obsessed and enthralled with. The pacing was beautifully slow, but well paced and the build up was great.So, the story line picks up right where it left off, with Feyre and Tamlin being back in the Spring Court, and now having to suffer from PTSD and anxiety. I absolutely love how SJM explored this and showcased how they were both affected by what happened in the events of the last book.Now, I was afraid that Tamlin's character was going to be completely bashed and written off since readers were hating on him and since I really liked his character in ACOTAR, that had me worried. But as I read on, the progression with his character made sense. As much as I loathed how he became, it's understandable and true to real life. His PTSD took on a different form. Sadly, that form became more emotionally abusive, manipulative and controlling. It was almost unbearable to even read. It was ugly but it needed to be there.Feyre just lost herself. She didn't know who she was anymore. Her trauma unfolded in a way that changed her completely and led her to who she truly needed to become.I absolutely loved how SJM incorporated those aspects into the story and how Feyre grew and continued to beautifully grow throughout the book. Facing setbacks, but ultimately, finding herself and her voice again. That 'human' element made it so relatable and warm. And the depth that SJM went into for both characters was impressive and you couldn't help but be invested and feel a strong sense of empathy.But what I loved more than anything was that SJM showed what a healthy and unhealthy relationship is. What to stand and not to stand for, depending on the standards you've set for yourself and which ultimately, you decide for yourself. 'Twas fuckin feminist as fuck, whilst also incorporating what true friendship and a healthy and loving relationship can do for your worth. To ultimately put your wellbeing ahead of everything so you may recognise the signs of an imbalanced relationship.And Rhysand? I need him in human form. Sometime soon, universe.This book just has so many fantastical and realistic elements to it. I loved that we were able to take something a way from it, enjoy it, and I'm even happier that SJM decided to extend this series.

The writing suffered a lot from telling and not showing, especially when it came to the dialogue, where it mostly consisted of the main character asking questions which would result in the other faeries answering via several pages of monologues in order to tell the exposition and characters’ background stories.

If you have problems with swearing, do not read this review*Buddy read with my partners in disappointment:Katerina&Vera. Yay, we are freed from under the Mountain at last! And a special hug goes to my dear friendSimona(click on the names to see girls\' reviews) You were right, dear, reading this book and, especially, discussing it is so much fun, indeed.First of all, let me show to you a simplediagram, where you can see how the level of my engagement toward this book...uh, plummeted (actually I wanted to make the diagram more vertical, but, well, I am not good with graphic stuff) with every chapter until nothing was left for me to enjoy.And let me tell you it was a rather bumpy and painful ride.Now, let\'s clarify a few things:- I am not a fan of ACOTAR. You can see inmy reviewwhy.- I had few expectations starting this book... ah hell, I had THE ONLY expectation - Rhysand.-I do not hate this book, I dislike it.<----- I am close to hating it now.This review is probably going to be a mess of thoughts with no structure, so I am sorry in advance if it\'s confusing, I just wanted to splash out my disappointment.I liked Rhys in the previous book; I liked his darkness. I knew he was not evil and had his reasons to act as he did, and I wanted to know why. I wanted him and Feyre together. But turns out, me and Rhys are never going to happen, not because he acts OOC (out of character) - after finishing the book, I know that he didn\'t act OOC - I dislike his sugary nature; there\'s too much goodness in him, he is practically a Saint: hell, he is the Saint among Fae!“We are lucky to have him, Feyre.” I turned from the door. “I have known many High Lords,” Amren continued, studying her paper. “Cruel ones, cunning ones, weak ones, powerful ones. But never one that dreamed. Not as he does.”“Dreams of what?” I breathed.“Of peace. Of freedom. Of a world united, a world thriving. Of something better—for all of us.”Of course, the other High Lords are stupid, they don\'t see the war coming, they are not interested in peace and prosperity, only Rhys does everything, and no one wants to listen to him.Poor baby.And let\'s not forget he is the strongest Fae out there.Here—here was the most powerful High Lord ever born.The face of dreams and nightmares.Only throughout the book, there was more than one situation where his ""mighty"" powers let him down.The question: why make him so powerful, impossibly so, if a little bit of vulnerability could\'ve made him more real and likable, and suited the plot better. It\'s unnatural to be that good. He became a cardboard character with no backbone and lives only to serve Feyre, it seems.But, fuck, it wasn\'t even my biggest issue. I hated how Maascompared Tam and Rhys in this book all the time. I never liked Tam, but, seriously, how much shit you can splash on one person before he turns into shit himself? I pity Tam and what Maas did to him. Time and again Maas shoves down our throats how Rhys excels Tam in everything: Tam didn\'t want to talk to Feyre about his nightmares. Rhys wanted to talk and share. Tam never held her hair while she vomited her guts out every night (she does it a lot, by the way, nauseatingly so). Rhys held her hair and cuddled her:He never woke when the nightmares dragged me from sleep; never woke when I vomited my guts up night after night. If he knew or heard, he said nothing about it.Large, warm hands pulled my hair back a moment later.“Breathe,” Rhys said. “Imagine them winking out like candles, one by one.”I heaved into the toilet again, shuddering as light and heat crested and rushed out of me, and savored the empty, cool dark that pooled in their wake.Tam locked her up in the house and forbade her to participate in any action. Rhys allowed her to do whatever she wanted. Tam didn\'t let her visit his rooms. Rhys invited her to his;With Tamlin, he’d kept his own rooms and slept in mine. And I supposed—I supposed it’d be the same.I was almost to my bedroom door when Rhysand drawled from behind me, “We can use your room if you like, but … ” He was leaning against his open bedroom door. “Either your room or mine—but we’re sharing one from now on. Just tell me whether I should move my clothes or yours. If that’s all right with you.”Tam is starving his people. Rhys\'s people prosper (he probably gives them food for free). Tam said there are no High Ladies in Prythian. Rhys made Feyre High Lady of Night Court. Comparisons were in EVERYTHING like the author couldn\'t stop shoving up our asses how Tam is lesser than Rhys in every aspect you can think of. And all this is solely for Feyre to make it easier to dump Tam and switch to Rhys.Then there\'s Feyre and herlovesex life. Feyre said that she fell for the first guy who showed kindness to her.I’m thinking that I was a lonely, hopeless person, and I might have fallen in love with the first thing that showed me a hint of kindness and safety.But she can\'t - wouldn\'t - admit that it wasn\'t love that she felt for Tamlin. She, time and again, repeats it was love: she loved and sacrificed and then forgot the guy in two months\' time. I would\'ve respected her more if she admitted that it was lust.He buried his face in my neck and said onto my nape, as if the words would be absorbed by my body, as if he could only say it the way we’d always been good at communicating—skin to skin.Whyfeel guiltyabout wanting another male? But no, Feyre is Mary Sue, she can\'t be the simple girl who had a change of heart. She loved but had serious reasons to fell out of love.Easy-peasy. Heck, I would\'ve respected her more if she was an elite prostitute serving High Lords and choosing her next lover without shame or labeling lust as love. But she is a hypocrite and Ihate hypocrites. It leads me to my next issue.Feyre/Rhysand. Honestly, I don\'t believe Tam loved Feyre, no, they just had a comfy agreement: fuck but don\'t ask questions. Rhys, on the other hand, I believe he really loved her. What about her? No. I am still not convinced it was love from Feyre\'s side; lust - yes. Again,Feyre has a pattern: when Rhys was a bad guy, she hated him, but when he started doing good stuff for her, she realized how good he is, how kind (don\'t forget this all is in comparison with Tam like we are stupid kids and can\'t fathom the universal truth: Rhys is good, Tam is bad);Feyre doesn\'t ""love"" Rhys despite his flaws, she ""loves"" him because he has no flaws.Mr. Purrfect Perfection. And when she finally admits she wants him, she still acts like a hypocrite by saying, ""But I loved Tam, deeply, I just don\'t any longer, because he treated me badly (I still don\'t get how splashing some paint on walls and locking her up once is abusive and the reason to easily fall out of love)."" Did you love him indeed? I want to ask for the thousandth time. Feyre just says she loved him to find an excuse to fuck Rhys. And that leads us to theirmating bond.When Feyre finds out they are mates, she relaxes and thinks, ""Fuck, what a relieve now that I know Tam and I was never going to happen, I don\'t have to feel guilty any longer for wanting to fuck Rhys"". But before we cover the mating process, let\'s touch on the snotty conversation they had. If you still had any doubts before that Rhys is a Saint, believe now that he is. He is a miracle reborn. Attention: he was always kind to Feyre even when he was a dick toward her. He loved her already when they were under the Mountain, he knew they are mates, it wrecked him to hurt her; he was jealous of unworthy Tam, but Rhys was noble and didn\'t want to ruin Feyre\'s life. And that sloppy melodramatic speech of his continues for a whole chapter!""A Court of snort and boredom""as someone on GR called it once (sorry, I don\'t remember who said that or I\'d hug this person). And again, Rhy\'s goodness is shoved down our throats *gags*Mate.My—mate.This beautiful, strong, selfless male … Who had sacrificed and wrecked himself for his family, his people, and didn’t feel it was enough, that he wasn’t enough for anyone.Also, as we are on the topic... did you noticehow many times the phrase""my mate""is repeated in the book?!Hundreds of times! It\'s like a broken record player. I think if I hear ""mate"" one more time I may vomit like our Feyre-parrot does all the time.They fuck. It\'s a disaster of epic proportions. Mountain quacked. MOUNTAIN. QUACKED. Seriously? What was that? Some kind of cheap shapeshifter porn?Okay, When they are done, and I am done yawning, and we all move to civilized surroundings... wait, what the fuck is happening?!Rhys acts like an animal, he can\'t stop wanting to screw Feyre. Their mating bond makes them horny as fuck. He is so protective of his female. It\'s serious stuff among Fae folk, they could even kill if another male looks sideways at their females.“The … frenzy,” he said carefully, as if fearful the wrong word might send us both hurtling for each other before we could get sustenance into our bodies. “When a couple accepts the mating bond, it’s … overwhelming. Again, harkening back to the beasts we once were. Probably something about ensuring the female was impregnated.” My heart paused at that. “Some couples don’t leave the house for a week. Males get so volatile that it can be dangerous for them to be in public, anyway. I’ve seen males of reason and education shatter a room because another male looked too long in their mate’s direction, too soon after they’d been mated.”Faeries - cunning, highly intelligent, powerful creatures act as if they are primitive animals from a cheap porn novel. After Rhys loses some steam fighting his buddy, he goes and fucks Feyre against the table. Everyone outside hears and knows. Wonders! How civilized they are indeed! Are we supposed to find these animal games romantic? Does it suppose to be a healthy relationship?And this book is labeled as YA and published by Bloomsbury Children\'s!It is NA (new adult) or erotic at the very least!My next issue - the plot. First of all, let\'s not delude ourselves there\'s something more to the book apart from theromancemating.The plot is a crutch for the romance.Everything characters do, they do between Rhys\'s and Feyre\'s courting. And even these parts are poorly executed. Why, oh why, does Maas need to chew everything for us?! We are not stupid, we can get hints and would like to have some space left for the imagination.Show, don\'t tell.Show us through hints and glances, make us work for information; make us want to know! And the plot itself is primitive: go there, do that - monotone routine with no unexpected parts. 50% into the book and I have already known how everything would end.I don\'t understand the half-orgy scene in the Court of Nightmares where Feyre and Rhys were almost fucking while everyone watched. It was a distraction while the others were stealing something important. It\'s so stupid I can\'t even. Maas couldn\'t think of something smart for distraction, rather than thisdisgusting humiliating scene?! The best part is the ending, though. Why would mortal queens conspire with the King of Hybern? Because they want immortality? They\'ll get their immortality but will be slaves. Would it be worth it? I don\'t think so. And why demonstrate the experiment with humans turning into Fae twice? Wasn\'t one time enough, when Feyre\'s sister Elain was made into Fae? Why make the same with Nesta? Because it serves Maas\'s idea of making Feyre\'s sisters immortal and finding mighty mates for them. It doesn\'t matter that the plot looks illogical and stretched - everything is ideal for Maas\'s grand plans. Tam is a traitor because he wants Feyre back. Why, he is a reborn villain now! How stupid it is to betray your country, because of the woman who doesn\'t want you? Why villains in this book so villainous? Why there\'s no depth to them? Good is good, bad is bad. End of conversation.This book is 640 pages long. 640 pages of unnecessary descriptions of clothes, Rhys\'s goodness, Tam badness, Feyre\'s vomiting, mating, getting from point A to point B. 640 pages of parading High Lords to who I wouldn\'t trust to rule a swamp, let alone whole Kingdoms. Where\'s the smart and cunning in this book? And what kind of place is Night Court? Is it a mix of East and West and the modern world? Lace underwear, seriously?! Why does Night Court resemble so much human reality? Is this another point to Rhys\'s goodness? I have tons of questions toward this book, but I don\'t think getting my answers will somehow make it better. It\'s late for that.I wouldn\'t say there wasn\'t anything good about the book for me. Compared to Rhys and Feyre I liked secondary characters, and Cass and Nesta as a couple attract me more than Rhys and Feyre ever will. It\'s sad I am not interested in learning more about them in the context of this series.When I started this book, I practically had no expectations, and now I am angry. Angry at the book I wasn\'t even sure I would read in the first place! It\'s a new low. If this book was an erotic novel or NA, I would say, ""Good, we had sexy time"" - and move on. But this book pretends to be something different than it really is. Something more meaningful and deep, and it cruelly deceives people into thinking they are going to read a fantasy YA with a strong plotline and character development. They will be surprised to find an entirely different beast here. I am glad I am finally done with this series:no more, never again, burn in hell, book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Re-read via audio!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""When you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.""Yall... this book... this book and its hype... this book and its hype and all it\'s spoilers;\xa0had me worried.\xa0On\xa0top of all that\xa0I\xa0feared that this book, all 600 plus pages, would suffer a massive case of second book syndrome.

Since this book was broken up in several sections I\'m\xa0going to basically break my review down by that.A Court of Mist and Furyis the second book in theA Court of Throns and Rosesseries. This book starts off right where ACOTAR ended. Feyre, however, isn\'t recovering well from what happened to her under the mountain. It doesn\'t help that Tamlin basically avoids talking about it at all cost and he insist that she never leaves the estate. Being trapped in the house just\xa0wedding planning, with no friends, no family, and waiting for the moment when Rhys comes to claim her for their deal. Feyre is a broken girl the first part of this book. Not knowing where she stands or where she wants to be. So many things happen in the first half of this book, all leading up to Rhys finally coming to get her. That\'s all I\'m really going to say about the first\xa0section\xa0of this\xa0book.The next part of this book we finally get a lot of\xa0the answers we\'ve been dying for! Answers about Rhys and why he is the way he is, we finally get to see the Night Court, we get to find out so much history on all the other courts, and oh so much more. We are also introduced to so many new side characters... Which easily\xa0became some of my all time favorites. Mor, Amren, Cassian, and Azriel brought everything to this story! I loved that Rhys decides to surround himself with the best of the best, say F the people who don\'t see females as badass, and puts two fierce girls as part of his inner circle. Cassian and Azriel, be still my beating heart. I loved these two. What interesting characters. Each with such a unique back story.\xa0This part of the book was all about build up and setting the stage for the ending.\xa0This is why it took me awhile to get through this book... but trust me get through it, its so wroth it.The last part\xa0of this book... God give me strength! I don\'t know how I\'m even going to get through the rest of this review. This section of the book was everything I ever wanted! There is action, suspense, romance, history, and\xa0twist. Everything that was building up from the first parts were perfect set up for this to be a big bang. There were also so many things that\xa0I thought were minor details in the first book that\xa0turned out to be huge reveals in this one.\xa0I was also so worried that the ""love triangle"" aspect still hanging in the air that it would end up ruining things for me. I can\'t not address it, and I swear it\'s not a spoiler, but allthe romance in this is PERFECT. It\'s also why this book is so much bigger than the first, because it\'s so full of sexy fun times.This book is hot, HOT! I really don\'t get how this book is still categorized as Ya, I think this jumped right into NA. Seriously, so yummy! I have for sure gotten on the same ship as everyone else.The ending. So much happens. It was so amazing. Shit hits the fan! I did not see it coming. I knew one thing that was going to happen, because you can\'t not see it, but the rest of it had me on the edge of my seat. I kept screaming ""WTF"" The whole time. Like really, what just happened?!?! Those last two chapters though. Those last two chapters were.... Lord! Oh and that last paragraph! That last sentence!!!! Lets just say it was the most epic!!!I wish my review was a little more detailed, and sorry if it\'s all over the place, but that\'s how this book made me feel. A messy, disorganized, and a hot mess.

I\'m frozen in 35646 layers of disbelief and I\'m trying hard not to explode from the sheer impossibility of this flawless story I\'ve read. I read, read, read, and read until I reached the Acknowledgements page and knew for sure that I finished the best book I\'ve read in like... an eternity.The story is simple, really. It picks up right where it left off inA Court of Thorns and Roses.Feyre is living in the Summer court and is going to marry Tamlin. But things have changed since she has turned into High Fae, an immortal body but with a human heart: She has to stay by Tamlin\'s side and be his trophy, left with nothing to do but paint and plan her wedding with Tamlin, High Lord of the Spring Court. As she grapples with the horrors she\'s had to endure Under The Mountain against Amarantha, she also awaits Rhysand, with whom she struck a bargain to visit his Night Court for one week every month.A Court of Mist and Furywas magical. Angsty. AndDamnably beautiful.Theplotwas so tangible, I didn\'t want to get it over with. Theromancewas so tantalizing, I felt my heart pound frantically in my chest. Theambiencewas soalluring, I struggled to take my eyes off it. And thetwistswere sounexpected, I was forced to gawk and stare at the ceiling, due to relief or stupefaction, I don\'t know. I was thoroughly enchanted in a world filled with intrigue, magic, lies, and secrets and I feel weighed down by the depth of it.Sarah J. Maas\'s writing is the literal definition ofmagnificent.She creates a world so captivating and lets you drown in waves ofwonderand intrigue,enigmaand appeal. Her words are powerful, heavy with conviction, articulate, and relevant. I can\'t thank her enough for delivering this masterpiece and much more. And for introducing me to two of the best characters I can\'t stop fangirling over.Rhysand.High Lord of the Night Court; Beautiful, brutal, and powerful. He appears to be cold and arrogant initially, occasionally cracking jokes about his beauty. He is surrounded by an aura of sensuality and vivacity and he handles even the direst of situations with grace, casually yet courteously. He is as dangerous and ferocious as he is subtle and generous. He hides behind a mask of savagery and manipulation, trickery and deception but beneath the mask, he\'s kind and humble, a High Lord who cares for his people more than he deigns to express.Feyre.Our strong protagonist who develops from being oblivious in the first book to someone who didn\'t need to be coddled, pampered or protected, who didn\'t cravestabilityandcomfort, orluxuryandeasiness. She hates being judged based on her human life. She can be compassionate, affectionate, and loving, but she can also be vicious, seductive, and cunning as she sees fit. Extremely short-tempered and sometimes provocative, she makes for her shortcomings by being powerful, warm, and unbelievably loyal (Ironic, as she keeps calling herself atraitor)I really liked Tamlin inA Court of Thorns and RosesI thought I\'d be devastated by not seeing him with Feyre. But the author made it easy for me to dislike him as he wanted to lock Feyre up, keep her as his trophy and suffocate her by being overprotective.""Love was balm as much as it was poison""The reason why Feyre had been hopelessly in love with Tamlin could\'ve been because of the fact that she was lonely and desired company and so fell for the first person who showed her a hint of kindness and offered commiseration and safety.Whereas Rhysand was different, he gave Feyre the freedom to choose what she desired and believed in her capabilities. He soundlessly, silently, fought for her. A perfect gentleman.""He locked you up because he knew- the bastard knew what treasure you are. That you are worth more than land and jewels.The story also shows us how much our first impression of people/ things could be wrong in the form of role reversals in the male protagonist. Rhysand, who I once perceived as a manipulator, liar, and a ""shameless flirt"" unveils his identity mask and shows how considerate and sacrificing he can be for the people he cares about. I\'m glad I could see a whole new depth to his character, that despite being hard as a shell on the outside, he too had moments of weakness wherein he needed consolation.The book was in support of feminism andequality.It also shows how one can go to any extent to protect their friends and loved ones whilst also exemplifying thatyou can choose your family.Cassian, Azriel, Amren, and Mor were amazing support systems and I\'d give anything to meet them in real life.I could keep going on and on about it, but I think I will peace out for now. 😁✌️'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I don’t even know what to say.

The most prominent one though, the one that glows with the fire of a thousand suns, is how—even as a cheasy, romantic fairytale—this book is more painful and human due to themes of trauma and mental health than both its predecessor and its inspirations:Beauty and the BeastturnedHades and Persephone.“To the stars who listen—and the dreams that are answered.”With anexpanded yet still fairytalish (meaning less defined rules) world,emotional, dramatic, flowing, thread-of-thought writing, andnew, captivating, and steal-your-heart-stab-you-in-the-dark characters and dynamicson top ofthemes of depression, abuse, and post traumatic stress disorder, ACoMaF really has much to talk about.Shall we begin to dig in?“[I knew that] I would never be a gentle grower of things, or someone who burned like fire—but that I would be quiet and enduring and as faceted as the night. That I would have beauty, for those who knew where to look, and if people didn’t bother to look, but to only fear it...then I didn’t particularly care for them, anyway.”Mental Health:How We Can Inflict Pain While in Pain➥PTSD, Depression, and (Possibly) BPD with Feyre & TamlinOne of the first things people criticiseA Court of Mist and Furyfor is Tamlin—some say his actions came out of the blue, while others agree that he was acting according to character but SJM made him an unnecessary villain when he could’ve been given support to heal. So before I discuss Feyre’s mental health issues and their representation, I’m going to address those two groups of people.“I am drowning. And the more you do this...you might as well be shoving my head under the water.”➤Do Tamlin’s choices come out of the blue?The answer is a simple no, and here’s why: Even inA Court of Thorns and Roses,Tamlin was a controling, aggressive, uncommunicative person who did not know how to truly listen or speak, how to be considerate and open. This makes sense because not only was he not taught any of those traits, he also experienced trauma and abuse growing up.He is extremely emotional and has no idea how to control those emotions, all while having learned to ignore his feelings because only ruthlessness equals survival and efficiency. This is unhealthy for a myriad of reasons, least of which is the fact that,no matter how willfully and insistently you turn away from your emotions, they never go away—closing your eyes so you might not see them doesn’t mean they aren’t there, it just means they’ll pounce on you in your greatest moments of weakness and you simply won’t see them coming.“The issue isn’t whether he loved you, it’s how much. Too much. Love can be a poison.”Tamlin is lonely and broken and living behind a wall of mistrust and fear, not knowing how to tear down that wall nor even acknowledging its existence. I have a couple of friends who struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder and, while I don’t want to diagnose anyone here, he actually reminded me of one of them. I will elaborate, bear with me.➤Is Tamlin’s arc unnecessary and unrealistic?That is a straight up no, because of the aforementioned friend. Much like my friend, Tamlin neither wants to acknowledge that he needs help, nor does he want to be vulnerable enough toacceptanyone’s help. Do I think he is broken beyond repair? No, no one is broken beyond repair.Our scars, however ugly, are what make us beautiful, and the cracks in a broken glass can be filled with gold, healed to become something new.But do I think he could’ve healed in this book with the help of Feyre and Lucien? Again no, because of two reasons.“There is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.” I pictured each. “There is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.”❶ I’ve personally grappled with mental illnesses for years and have friends both online and offline suffering who I’ve walked this path with, dragged back from the edge of suicide, and given help and solutions to when they hurt themselves and others so they could heal. I’ve also made a very, very unhealthy choice again and again and put aside my healing to be everyone’s full-time therapist. Anyone who was in pain? I would roll up my sleeves, telling them to come seek me out whenever and for whatever, and put all my energy in the ring when they did.Now, I’ve learned something from my online big sis Cath:You areno one’s therapist(unless that’s your job ofc). And Feyre did what she could to give Tamlin the space and support he needed, but she was also suffering herself and it’s cruel and infuriating to expect her to completely forget about her own pain and force him to heal when he isn’t truly accepting or seeking help. Which is the 2nd reason.“Sweep it under the rug, like everything else.”❷It’s one thing to support and help a friend towards healing, and it’s another thing toheal them. You can’t save a drowning man who refuses to take your hand. You could jump in, grab them, and swim to shore—but there’s a high chance they would drown you, too, in their attempt to get you off them.Again, I have done this, and it’s wrong because not only was I taking away their choice and saying that I know better (which I don’t, it’s their life) I was also risking them drowning me—I don’t much care about this, let me drown who cares, but it’s not healthy behaviour.Still, I’ve done it, put life and breath and soul into showing those drowning friends why they should seek a hand to stop their drowning and learn to swim, and I’ve failed as many times as I’ve succeeded. That friend I mentioned Tamlin reminded me of? She’s one where I failed, and all I could do was watch her in pain as she lashed out and inflicted pain on others, and try my best to do damage control with her victims—because theywerevictims, as Feyre clearly is one.A victim of abuse rooted in ignored, festering pain, twisting a caring, passionate soul into a source of suffering.“There are good days and hard days for me—even now. Don’t let the hard days win.”Now that that is out of the way, how about Feyre’s struggles?➤Above all else, this book is a love letter to healing.I can’t personally vouch for the PTSD (which I found accurately written based on what I’d learned of it from others’ experiences), but I can tell you about depression. And I can tell you how heartwrenchingly Feyre’s suffocating blanket of silence that cruelly embraced her and hauled her beneath the sea resonated with me. I will leave the exploration and healing to Sarah J. Maas. Thank you.Friendship:Why We Need Support to Heal➥Rhys, Mor, Amren, Azriel, and Cass Vs.

Just to buy me some damned peace.”#relatable✦Rhysandmight not be my number one (or two, or even three) character in this series, but that does not mean I don’t love him, it just shows how many amazing characters grace the pages of this book—because Idolove him.He might be arrogant and teasing and always seem in control, but underlying that facade is a deeply rooted insecurity and self doubt.They do say the most seemingly arrogant people in the room are the least confident ones (I mean, I hope they do and I didn’t just creates a saying out of the blue).Confidence means believing in yourself even as you mess up, and Rhys might be arrogant but he’s not confident—his every mistake and misstep are worms he lets devour him from the inside out. And he does make mistakes, because he is not perfect, just as no one is; he is a person who, in his drive to protect and give and give andgivefrom himself until he is bled dry, tends to occasionaly refuse to share what he knows and others should be informed of. What’s most important though is howhe accepts, apologises, and learns from his mistakes because what he values most is freedom of individuals to choose the path they want to walk.“You remain your own person. You decide your fate—your choices. Not me. You chose yesterday. You choose every day. Forever.”✦Amrenwith her no-nonsense, practical, I-will-sooner-kill-you-than-coddle-you attitude is my real number one, because this unyielding Tiny Ancient One would tear the world to pieces to fight for what she holds dear—though you wouldn’t guess what it is she values with her general cutting reply to everything around her.“I once lived in a place where the opinion of others mattered. It suffocated me, nearly broke me. [...] with enough courage, you can say to hell with a reputation. You do what you love, what you need.”✦Mortakes the spot as my 2nd fave right next toAzriel; where one is fire and boldness and charisma, the other is ice and silence and an enigma, and both will have your back and front and sides all the way to the threshold of death—and beyond. And then there is babyCassianwith his insufferable arrogance and heart of marshmallows that will push you and be there to catch you if you fall. (I need to add that I will take my hope for a polyamorous relationship between these three with their complicated, enchanting dynamic to the grave and hold it close through whatever comes next).✦ But why are they so important to Feyre’s healing?Because you can’t heal alone. I’ve tried it, and the road is rockier and more precarious without a shoulder to lean on and a hand to hold.I’m still learning to not cringe at taking a hand to walk the path (and failing, not gonna lie) but I nevertheless appreciate how breathtakingly SJM writes these journeys of recovery every. damn. time. You need friends to heal, and you need to help friends to heal.“I wonder if, even in my despair and hopelessness, I was never truly alone. I wonder if I was looking for this place—looking for you all.”✦ That’s whereLucienfails. I love him and his loyal heart, but sometimes you need to check your loyalty—sometimes the people and values you are holding on to are breaking something rare and fragile.That’s the precise issue with Lucien: He does not understand the depth of Feyre’s pain, if he had, he would’ve fought without backing down, getting up each time he hit the ground, because my baby is not a coward. Alas, people don’t ever really grasp another’s invisible pain.Romance:Where Love Can Bloom(SPOILER ALERT)➥Instalove or Slow Burn, featuring Feysand“I’m thinking, that I look at you and feel like I’m dying. Like I can’t breathe.”Rhysand and Feyre are not my fave couple as their dynamic is too sweet and romantic for me personally. However, it takes nothing away from howyoufeelthem fall in love, like a flower blooming and a freezing pair of hands finding colour next to the miracle of fire, or like the warmth and light of a familiar embrace you fall into in a world of cold, dark unknowns.Some readers accuse the mating bond of being instalove in the case of Rhysand falling for Feyre. Did they read chapter 54? Rhysand fell for her as she was a human surviving Under the Mountain, and everything he did before that was him trying to save an innocent girl he suspected of being his mate but did not specifically feel anything towards.In the end, mayhaps this book is too romantic for me, the aromantic with a heart of ice, to ever be my #1 book of all time, it nonetheless makes a comfortable and cozy den in its corner becauseA Court of Mist and Furyis a fairytale that takes the dashing princes and magic, and replaces it with human suffering and healing.“You think I don’t know how stories get written—how this story will be written? I am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end.

In a plot that never pauses for breath, relayed in his own unsparing voice, he braves the modern perils of foster care, child labor, derelict schools, athletic success, addiction, disastrous loves, and crushing losses. Through all of it, he reckons with his own invisibility in a popular culture where even the superheroes have abandoned rural people in favor of cities.Many generations ago, Charles Dickens wroteDavid Copperfieldfrom his experience as a survivor of institutional poverty and its damages to children in his society. Those problems have yet to be solved in ours. Dickens is not a prerequisite for readers of this novel, but he provided its inspiration. In transposing a Victorian epic novel to the contemporary American South, Barbara Kingsolver enlists Dickens' anger and compassion, and above all, his faith in the transformative powers of a good story.Demon Copperheadspeaks for a new generation of lost boys, and all those born into beautiful, cursed places they can't imagine leaving behind.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': ""WARNING: SPOILAGE OF SUPER PREDICTABLE ENDING CONTAINED HEREIN. ALSO, EVERY TIME YOU TELL ME HOW MUCH I SUCK FOR NOT LOVING THIS BOOK YOU GUYS FLOAT IT BACK TO THE TOP OF THE HOME PAGE AND IT GETS MORE LIKES SO THANKS 😜Everyone and their dog has been falling all over the place expressing their love for Barbara Kingsolver’s latest release. And then there’s me . . . .I’m not here to yuck your yum so Imma keep it real short. In a nutshell, Kingsolver is an author who is consistently trying to write the “Great American Novel” and nothing demonstrates that more than her undertaking a modernization ofDavid Copperfield. In short, I just don’t think she’s my jam. Nearly 25 years agoThe Poisonwood Bibleknocked my socks off, but it’s a book I could never re-read in fear that I wouldn’t have the same reaction a second time around.My main issue with this one is that I am so over clichéd, stereotypes of Appalachia. Boy oh boy didDemon Copperheaddeliver them in spades. Our impoverished lead goes from bad to worse when it comes to an abusive household, to being orphaned, to one awful foster home situation to another (but don't worry - it ends at neglect - Kingsolver isn't ready to go to the darkest of locales when it comes to Demon's childhood). Eventually genetics get on young Demon’s side and he becomes a local high school football hero . . . until, you guessed it, his knee gets blown out and he becomes an addict. But don’t worry – he still gets a fairly happy ending and sees the ocean *eyeroll*In addition to the been there/done that feel of this entire story, you can’t re-write history in an attempt to prove how “woke” you are. A high school English teacher (and a black teacher in the middle of the Holler, at that) in the early to mid-1990s wouldn't have dared to explain the movement of literature changing the term “black” to “Black.” Not to mention how regular folks were not aware of the dangers of opioids or how Big Pharma was controlling the narrative when they first hit the market, but the nurse in here was 100% in the know of what's going down. You want to learn more about the modern-day drug crises and how it came to be? ReadDopesick.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'It’s barely Halloween. The ball won’t drop in Times Square for another two full months, and more good books will surely appear before the year ends. But I already know: My favorite novel of 2022 is Barbara Kingsolver’s “Demon Copperhead.”Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, this is the story of an irrepressible boy nobody wants, but readers will love. Damon is the only child of a teenage alcoholic — “an expert at rehab” — in southwest Virginia. He becomes aware of his status early, around the same time he gets the nickname Demon. “I was a lowlife,” he says, “born in the mobile home, so that’s like the Eagle Scout of trailer trash.” The more he grasps the connotations of words like “hick” and “redneck,” the more discouraged he becomes. “This is what I would say if I could, to all the smart people of the world with their dumb hillbilly jokes. …We can actually hear you.”Now, we can hear him.“You get to a point of not giving a damn over people thinking you’re worthless,” he says. “Mainly by getting there first yourself.”Demon is right about America’s condescending derision, but he’s wrong about his own worth. In a feat of literary alchemy, Kingsolver uses the fire of that boy’s spirit to illuminate — and singe — the darkest recesses of our country.The essential Americanness of “Demon Copperhead” feels particularly ironic given that Kingsolver has drawn her inspiration directly from one of England’s most celebrated classics: “David Copperfield,” by Charles Dickens. In a brief afterword, Kingsolver expresses her gratitude to Dickens and acknowledges....To read the rest of this review, go to The Washington Post:https://www.washingtonpost.com/books/...'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I waited a long time to get my turn for this book from the library. I was anticipating it with relish, because several of my trusted friends had loved it and said they, like me, had not enjoyed Kingsolver’s last few books. I was all prepared to be swept away, and I was in the beginning, but Demon has a voice that captivates you and then wears on you and then wears you out.At least Kingsolver wasn’t preaching to me in this book, but she did seem to be in love with the sound of her own voice, because she wrote pages and pages on subjects that could have sufficed with much less, and she repeated herself endlessly regarding both the lousy DSS system, the details of drug addiction, and the hopelessness of anyone who is born in the hills of Appalachia. At some point, for me, that hopelessness became a bit like the prejudice she seemed to be railing against.The first 200 pages of this book were somewhat enchanting, the middle was a slog, and the ending was not enough to make up for that. It was not a bad read, but not the 5-star read I had hoped for. Perhaps in the end, you cannot tell someone else’s story as well as they do. David Copperfield is 10-star material, Kingsolver transformed it into something just a tad over okay.I had said to myself once before that Kingsolver and I were done with one another, but this book tempted me back for another try. This time, I think, the breakup is permanent. So many other authors I want to give a fair chance.If you have the stomach for the endless beating of the opioid drum, this book will be for you. There are meant to be redeeming moments at the end, promises of better lives for a few, but those seem more like dreams, while the sinking and despair that consumed ninety percent of this book seemed all too real.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This novel is described as a modern day version of David Copperfield, which I’ve never read. I’m generally not a fan of rewrites of classics, so if I had read it, I may not have picked this one up even though Barbara Kingsolver is such an amazing writer whose books I have loved over the years. I’m grateful to have read this novel because I would have missed out on a brilliant story - brutal, but brilliant and a character who was in my heart from the first to the last page .An addicted teenage mother, an abusive stepfather, a corrupt foster care system reeking of abuse is what Demon Copperhead endures at the young age of ten years old. Working on a tobacco farm, then with a family who has him sleeping in a dog room, hungry, taking leftovers from school lunch trays, he endures - somehow without speaking up to his case worker for fear of what his next foster situation would be. His next one turns out to be life altering in more ways than one. This is an in your face, in your gut punch, no holds barred portrayal all of that, and a stabbing expose of the opioid epidemic in Appalachia.It’s depressing and heartbreaking to read with little respite. I was drained at times . As with other books by Kingsolver, there is a social message here, but it’s not just told with statistics of addictions, deaths, but through the moving story of a character as a little boy and then as a young man, with all of the horrors he faced in between, feeling as real as it gets .I received a copy of this book from HarperCollins through Edelweiss.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Demon Copperhead entered the world in a single trailer, born to a single mother who hadn’t a clue how to look after him - nor did she have the means. The southern Appalachian mountains of Virginia is where he took his first breath - a place of dire poverty, though most local folk were in the same boat, so it was pretty normal. Demon’s mum though had additional problems, and that meant even less of the basic needs for the two of them. Thank God for good neighbours.I won’t go into the synopsis as this is a lengthy (over 600 pages) and eventful novel. However, this is a tale of love and the need for love, it’s about dreams and anger, hate and pain, and what really stands out is how the opioid crisis is responsible for many of those bad feelings, and demonstrates how it wrecks the lives that might otherwise have climbed out of that daily grinding poverty, perhaps realising those long held dreams and ambitions.The journey for Demon Copperhead is long and eventful, (epic is the best way to describe it). The writing is so beautiful - exquisite even, but it takes the reader to places so dark, depressing and dangerous with its intimate detail, that you wonder why you find such beauty in it. But it’s there on every page, in every event and every crisis - harrowing yet uplifting. Has to be one of the standout books of the year - it is stunning!*Thank you to Netgalley and Faber and Faber Ltd for my much appreciated ARC. I have given an honest unbiased review in exchange *'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I think it is finally time for me to part ways with Kingsolver\'s books for good. I lovedThe Poisonwood Bibleback in the day, then hatedUnsheltered, and all the hype plus my love ofDavid Copperfieldconvinced me to try this one... but I\'m just not feeling whatever magic everyone else did.I found the characters inDemon Copperheadto be utterly soulless and forgettable. Demon tells his life story and the narration reads like ""this happened and then this happened and then this happened"", making it impossible for me to become immersed in the story being told. Many reviewers have commented on how emotionally-connected they felt, but sadly I felt the complete opposite.The more I think about this book, the more I dislike it. I dislike how every cliched predictable thing that could happen, happens. Kid born to a junkie mom-- guess what happens? Kid gets a new stepfather-- guess what happens? Kid goes into foster care-- guess what happens? Kid becomes a star footballer-- guess what happens? Kid gets prescribed oxy-- guess what happens? Kid gets a junkie girlfriend-- guess what happens? In comes a ferocious but charming dog-- guess what fucking happens?There was a point in the middle of this book, deep in the longest dullest stretch, where Demon meets a character and I knew, I just knew, exactly what would happen to them. It\'s like one of those country songs that is so tragic it\'s slightly comical.Critics have been fawning over this book like it\'s such a feat of literary fiction when it literally combines every single hillbilly tragedy trope into one life story. And still, somehow, manages to be boring!Give meBastard Out of Carolinaover this any day.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Now Winner of the Women\'s Prize for Fiction 2023 *aaargh*Joint Winner of the Pulitzer Prize 2023 with the equally simplisticTrustA twist onDavid Copperfield, focusing on an Appalachian boy whose life is overshadowed by the opioid epidemic? That sounds like a fantastic idea. And Kingsolver does a great job crafting Demon Copperhead\'s voice, making the resourceful boy (and later young man) sound witty, empathetic, and engaging, infusing his whole vibe with someThe Adventures of Huckleberry FinnandTo Kill a Mockingbird. Of course we\'re also dealing with an important topic, and Kingsolver is here to give the overlooked and left-behind a voice - but this is where the problem starts.I am not at all saying that a successful, famous writer is generally unable to convey what it means to be a person like destitute Demon in the rural South, it just doesn\'t work very well in this particular text, and the reason can be found in the plot itself: While Kingsolver has a lot of empathy for her characters and is obviously very upset about the societal situation - this book is rooted in her impetus for change -, everything that happens to Demon is already present in the readers\' preconceived notions of socially unstable, ""backwards"" Appalachia: Teenage single mom with substance abuse issues who dies? Check. Mean step-dad? Check. Abuse in the foster system? Check. Demon gets addicted to opioids? Check.Sure, the language is often evocative due to the strong narrator Demon, but at the end of the day, Kingsolver activates stereotypes that already exist in the readers\' repertoire, and then adds some social commentary (capitalism is bad; rural communities deserve respect; the Sackler family is trash, etc.), so we all can feel like we are standing on the correct side, that we who are reading this are the good ones. This unchallenging outrage activism, no matter how well-intentioned, has a tendency to be patronizing and to serve as a narcissistic tool of moral self-assurance. It\'s, to put it bluntly, intellectually lazy, and it certainly does not help to show people from Appalachia in a new, more nuanced light - on the contrary: It only tells us what we already believe to be true.I, for once, want literature to challenge my beliefs, especially regarding communities I am not familiar with, so groups of people that only exist as reflections in my head to begin with (I am German, but I think Appalachia is a region that is unfamiliar to many Americans as well). When a novel relies so heavily on widespread notions and then adds clichéd narrative devices (of course Demon, in the most classic of all classicBildungsromanmotifs, is also an artist; and there is the tragic twist; and a football coach; and the good-hearted grandmother, ... *argh*), it becomes rather annoying, especially because this novel is way, way, way too long. Boy, it is long. It\'s insane. It just goes on. And on. And then it goes on. And finally, the ending is pure kitsch.So I guess this has solid chances to get Booker-nominated as the Oprah book club crowd-pleaser with the socially relevant message that outstays its welcome and is of dubious literary merit. If so, I\'m glad that I can already cross it off my list. Demon as a character is great though.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between…”-\tBarbara Kingsolver,Demon CopperheadBarbara Kingsolver’sDemon Copperheadis my favorite type of novel. Big and messy and sprawling; funny and tense and sad; and written by an author whose talents are awe-inspiring.This is an ambitious work, replete with striking tonal shifts, a memorable cast of secondary characters, and powerful set pieces. It has an old-fashioned feel, a bildungsroman that begins with the birth of its main character – Damon Fields, whose nickname gives the book its title – and follows him throughout a tumultuous journey into a premature adulthood. It is wildly imperfect, but its imperfections suit a larger purpose, mirroring the life it is trying to capture.As long asDemon Copperheadis – and at 560 pages, it’s pretty long – when you get to the last page, you want to keep on going. Kingsolver has created a very particular world, inhabited it with people you can’t forget, and coerced from me an emotional investment that I’m not often willing to make in fiction.***The first – and most obvious – thing to be said aboutDemon Copperheadis that it is a retelling of Charles Dickens’sDavid Copperfield, transplanted from nineteenth century England to rural Virginia during the ravages of the Purdue Pharma-sponsored opioid epidemic.It is not necessary to have read Dickens’s ponderous classic – I’ll admit, I’m only halfway through, and taking a lengthy break – and in some ways, it’s probably better that you have not. In particular, those who’ve read the original will have a very good idea about the direction Kingsolver is going, and some of the twists and turns are the same as they were over 170 years ago.On the other hand, those who are familiar with the Dickens version will have a good time matching the characters and the plot-points. Dickens’s Uriah Heep, for example, is marvelously transformed by Kingsolver into a creepy assistant football coach.***LikeDavid Copperfield,Demon Copperheadis an episodic novel, told in the first-person by our hero, a scrappy and resilient youngster for whom the past is as mysterious as the future. He is born poor in the Appalachian Mountains, to a teenage mother with substance abuse issues. Demon’s lengthy arc consists of his attempts to navigate the minefields of poverty, child protective services, drug use, foreshortened opportunities, and – of course – love.To say much more would be to say too much. It should suffice that Kingsolver does a fantastic job of utilizing a modified serial approach, so that the forward momentum ofDemon Copperheadis always urging you to read just one more page.***One of Dickens’s shortcomings – at least in my opinion – is the essential blandness of his main protagonists. It often felt like the chief focus fell on the least interesting person in his books.That is not a problem here.Demon is a fascinating creation, and holds the center from first to last. He narrates his tale in a low-key idiom that is stylized without being inaccessible. I don’t know whether Kingsolver was trying to achieve an authentic colloquial expression, and – if she was – I’m in no position to say whether she was successful. The important thing, for me, is that Demon maintained a consistent and engaging voice.From the start, we are rooting for Demon to succeed. To Kingsolver’s credit, though, she allows him to be flawed. There are moments when he is unlikeable, selfish, self-involved, and borderline awful. Allowing him these dimensions gives him a far deeper humanity than might otherwise have been achieved.That said, Kingsolver often runs into two different literary traps that I have wholly invented. The first I like to call the Idiot-Genius Paradox, wherein a character is high-functioning, intelligent, and capable, right up to the point where the storyline requires him or her to do something stupid. There is a corollary to this trap for children – let’s call it the Selectively Precocious Child Conundrum – when an author chooses to narrate a story through a youngster whose behavior and actions have only a tenuous relation to their developmental age.This is a long way of saying that one of the conceits you have to swallow is that Demon – especially early in the novel – would be able to reason and express himself at such an extraordinarily high level, given his supposed minority. And also that these preternatural talents will randomly disappear for drama’s sake.***The constellation of people around Demon is head-spinning. When we think of Dickens –ifwe think of Dickens, that is – we tend to recall his unforgettable supporting casts. At least, that’s been my experience.InDemon Copperhead, Kingsolver carries on that tradition admirably. Almost everyone who walks across Demon’s path makes an impression. Just a short list includes his mother, struggling with her addictions; an abusive stepfather who mistakes his cruelty for teaching; a child support worker with one eye on the door; an exploitative foster father trying to keep his farm afloat; a hilarious man-hating old woman; and a football coach willing to cut a few corners to achieve the status of local legend.This doesn’t even include Demon’s love interests, or Sterling “Fast Forward” Ford, who is so deftly, frighteningly drawn that I am certain that whoever plays him in the movie will earn an Oscar.***Carrying on the Dickensian tradition of social criticism, Kingsolver becomes the latest author to attempt an explanation for the failures of the rural white working class. She does this with varying levels of success.At its best,Demon Copperheadpaints a vivid picture of an overstressed child support division, schools that care more about athletics than academics, and people who can’t see a way forward. Especially effective is the interweaving of oxycontin into the storylines. It begins as a background presence, then explodes into the open, revealing a hellscape of pill farms and profit-mad drug reps working through profit-mad doctors, both in service to a rapacious corporation, leaving behind hollowed-out users cycling through withdrawal, if they’re lucky enough to survive.Unfortunately, there are times whenDemon Copperheadslips into half-conceived lectures implying that rural folk are stuck because the rest of the country is being mean to them. This is less than convincing, but maybe I’m a bit fatigued from this dialogue, which has been racing in circles since 2016.In short, I’m over trying to understand people who don’t seem that interested in understanding me.***For all their detail, Dickens’s novels always felt a tad sanitized. His slums, while slummy, were basically false, shorn of cursing, sex, violence, and excretory filth.Demon Copperheadhas all those missing elements, many times over.So, be aware of that.***When I finish a book, I never have the chance to write about it immediately. Days – even weeks – can elapse before I try to put my thoughts into complete sentences that are at least adjacent to grammatical soundness.This interim is often a good indicator of my true feelings for a book. It gives me a period to decide if my initial response – possibly skewed by the adrenal rush of finishing – holds up to reflection.When I finishedDemon Copperhead, it had me breathless. That sensation remains.There are moments, weeks later, when I find myself thinking about all the different people I met, and wondering where they went, how they’re doing, and if they’re going to be okay. I’ve even found myself staring at the finished book on my shelf, pondering whether I should open it again, just to check on everyone one last time.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I love Barbara Kingsolver, so I picked this as our book club selection. Then, I had the bright idea that since this was based on David Copperfield, I should try reading that first. 800 pages, dry as dirt, and I gave up at page 200. That had me worried. Until the first page of this book. OMG! The language! Her way with words is beyond description. I wanted to highlight multiple phrases per page. I quickly realized I’d be highlighting the whole book. I found myself getting caught up time after time by some phrase or sentence. She just tells it so you really understand something.This book sucked me in. Demon’s life was one long sorrowful moan. But not just his. Almost everyone in this tale has had trouble. This is a deeply depressing book. But thank heavens it ends on a note of hope for those still standing at the end.I was impressed that Kingsolver was able to take this re-telling of David Copperfield and make it about the opioid crisis in Appalachia. It shows that not much has changed between Victorian times and now when it comes to the disadvantaged being marginalized and ignored. It starts with an area with little on offer, government programs stretched beyond its limits and first one, then another, industry more interested in profits than people. The plot is a reminder that severe poverty isn’t just limited to the inner cities. If anything, there's as much prejudice against the “trailer trash”. “A blight on the nation…a smudge on the map.”I highly recommend this and it is definitely one of my favorite books of the year.

He wrote about the pervasive fog caused by pollution, child labor, and debtors’ prison. You see…..Dickens’ father went to debtors’ prison, and, as a minor child, Charles lived there. And these books like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield helped to turn the tide on crucial issues.Similarly, Barbara Kingsolver retells David Copperfield amongst the backdrop of the opioid epidemic in Demon Copperhead.The first half of the book is extremely engaging and entertaining as the reader follows Demon through his struggles as he tries to forge a path through obstacles he didn’t make, a fascinating mixture of bleak circumstances permeated by rays of hope.The last half of the book felt a little slow and overly dismal, almost as though the editor ran out of steam. Admittedly, the last half is tricky because there are several subplots that have to be concluded.Perhaps I have nostalgia for the original David Copperfield, but I remember the Fast Forward character being much more nuanced. It wasn’t clear if this character was a “good” character or a “bad” character. Good people can do bad things, and bad people can do good things. This is one of the things that resonated so deeply with the original—people aren’t stamped as either good or bad, and we have to find out with David about Fast Forward. In Demon Copperhead, the Fast Forward character wasn’t as grey, and his subplot seemed to be dropped only to reappear awkwardly and inorganically at the end.As far as the ending, it left me wanting.

I was so taken so affected by the storytelling itself…..it’s a book that has never left me.But….I have never yet read any other book that I felt accomplished that type of narrative —(a narrative circle of family characters)….I thought it was soooo brilliant….yet, since 2009,I’ve read many more authors who adopted the TAKE TURNS styling, but for me, most of the time they have a ‘paint-by-numbers’ quality to me.NOT Barbara Kingsolver! For me, she was the Queen creator of unique ‘narrative-circle’. Her crafting felt inventive & primitive — fitting to the jungle setting where a Baptist preacher took his wife and four daughters.So….clearly “The Poisonwood Bible” is still my favorite Kingsolver book…..but…..”Demon Copperhead” —with a rapturous and heroically protagonist—comes in as a very close 2nd favorite.I couldn’t agree more with this statement: “Demon is a voice for the ages—akin to Huck Finn or Holden Caulfield—only even more resilient”.Demon Copperhead reflects social and political viewpoints through realistic characters. The socioeconomic messages are felt throughout….but…it’s the nitty-gritty-bigger-than-life-immersive storytelling— with Demon ‘telling-this story’…..looking back on his coming-of-age life….that unabashedly delves into the hearts and souls of her characters — exposing something so raw and tender. Humanity is being exposed!So….ABOUT …some of those ‘nitty-gritty’ details….…..Some CHARM nitty gritty’s:….like Demon’s love for snicker bars, comics, and playing spitball with other orphan kids…..Some MAKE YOUR HEART ACHE nitty gritty’s:…..like being born into poverty by a teenage-single mother. Being tossed around from one Foster Care home to another, each worse than the next….no socks, no winter coat, lots of child labor —scrubbing and cleaning, cuttin tobacco, being called a “dead junkie’s kid”, taking crap from teachers, bullying kids, laughed at by girls, hunger….(so much hunger), opioid addiction, (damn—it was everywhere in those Appalachia mountains), ….Yet…..people were saying “a cripple was a punishment from God”?….. (what’s wrong with people?)It’s the tossing of a sentence here or there — that will spark-a-fire-in readers ‘feeling’ ANGER FOR THE CONDITIONS of life —I CAN’T IMAGINE ANY READER NOT FINDING THIS NOVEL FULLY ABSORBING—and DEEPLY AFFECTING-The full range of emotions are felt from birth into Demon’s adulthood.There are numerous themes and plot lines to contemplate….Demon’s tiny, pretty, mom, for example — she was not a bad person — she just wasn’t well. Looking through the eyes of Demon — he held onto the best parts of his mom. He loved being told that he was the best thing that ever happened to her.Demon was not only a likable child — but a forgiving character to boot (to a point)….But when his mother went and re-married a man named Stoner >>a beast of an abusive jerk, he only made Demon’s hard knock life worse.In one dialogue conversation— Demon was asked, “what he might like to do when he got older?” His replay…..was, “huh?, live”….To be a growing child with fear — to serious worry if whether or not you will survive to adulthood — let alone indulge a smudge of freedom— a taste of the American dream…is gut-wrenching.Love and hate are interwoven dangerously close together.We get clear visuals of the issues of our modern day American foster care system: homeless neglected children— victims of violence, abuse, and drug addictions are rampant.Children competing for food, hoarding food, and fighting for personal hygiene items is devastating. …..and is still a real issue.Demon was smart — he could read — draw - (superheroes of course) …and in some ways he was considered a ‘poverty- prodigy’ of sorts. But with so much abuse, addiction, poverty, betrayal all around him, without safety nets…. impoverished communities…it would take a miracle to come out on top.The ending is hopeful ……but before we get to the end —we journey through loss of innocence, alienation, isolation, cynicism, farm work, sarcasm, history, schools, shame, current events, social events, good versus evil, perseverance,— we meet other impactful characters influencing Demon’s life…(friends, Tommy, Emmy, Betsy, Dick,) Mrs. Peggot (a kind neighbor) — later in High School Coach Winfield and daughter Agnes….a football accident, a very powerful funeral that triggered memories of my own father’s funeral (he was 34- I was 4), —ongoing coming-of-age tales —New Years, new jobs, summer vacations,a love interest, Dorie, the girl Demon falls in love with ( a complicated drug-related relationship)…..It’s too easy to get to a point in life …..”where you don’t give a damn if people are thinking that you are worthless”.Everything about this book is remarkable … The descriptions, the insights, the plot structure, the treacherous hardships, epic, epic epic..stunning—- beautiful and brilliantly written!Pulitzer Prize quality!As Demon himself might say…..”Shit, and Hallelujah”!He told a damn good story!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Demon Copperheadis said to be inspired byDavid Copperfield, a masterpiece I read a couple of years ago. I most definitely can see that inspiration in Kingsolver’s novel. I would be hesitant, however, to make any further comparisons because for me that puts a contemporary novel on shaky ground when setting it next to a classic, beloved book. I can somehow forgive Charles Dickens for his verbosity. After all, that was the vogue back in his day.David Copperfieldwas a series of installments, stretched out over a period of time. He didn’t get paid by the word but by installment; still, he had a lot of mouths to feed. Barbara Kingsolver, on the other hand, could have done with a lot less, and I would have been a much happier reader for it. That’s not to say that her points are less important than Dickens’ themes. She absolutely had good reason to share what she did here.“That November it was still a shiny new thing. OxyContin, God’s gift for the laid-off deep-hole man with his back and neck bones grinding like bags of gravel. For the bent-over lady pulling double shifts at Dollar General with her shot knees and ADHD grandkids to raise by herself. For every football player with some of this or that torn up, and the whole world riding on his getting back in the game. This was our deliverance. The tree was shaken and yes, we did eat of the apple.”But this isn’t only about drugs and pharmaceutical companies and shady doctors taking advantage of a whole group of people. It’s also about the foster care system and how it fails those most in need of protection. It’s about the long reach of the coal mine owners and how their power reverberated across the years, affecting everything in these individual’s lives from wages to education to property and more. Someone should be held accountable, and that’s where I find Kingsolver’s work to be admirable, without a doubt. However, I still couldn’t get the author out of my head while reading this story - despite the fact it was supposedly told through a young boy-turned-young adult’s point of view. I’ve read and loved some of Kingsolver’s earlier work but have had difficulty with more of her “recent” work for the same reason. If I sense the writer sitting next to me on the couch while I read, I get a little cranky. I would much rather feel like his or her characters are having a nice heart to heart with me instead. And that brings me to another niggle - Demon’s “voice” throughout the book. I just couldn’t jibe with it. It got on my nerves A LOT!“If a mother is lying in her own piss and pill bottles while they’re slapping the kid she’s shunted out, telling him to look alive: likely the bastard is doomed. Kid born to the junkie is a junkie. He’ll grow up to be everything you don’t want to know, the rotten teeth and dead-zone eyes, the nuisance of locking up your tools in the garage so they don’t walk off, the rent-by-the-week motel squatting well back from the scenic highway.”I don’t mind gritty but what I couldn’t quite wrap my head around was who on earth is speaking these words? Supposedly, this is Demon as a young boy at the start of the story (the above passage occurs on page 2). Is this a super savvy kid speaking? Or is it Demon as an old man looking back and narrating? Or is it Kingsolver trying really hard to create a voice she feels is authentic? I don’t know, honestly. But it happened over and over again to me throughout the 500+ pages. It's like nails on a chalkboard!Okay, I’ll lay off the complaining now. This is, after all, a 3-star book in my mind so there has to be another good thing or two, right?! What I loved most were the strong women in Demon’s life. Without them, I’m afraid to imagine Demon’s fate. In these Appalachia stories, I’ve often found that the women are the ones holding down the fort. It’s their strength and perseverance in the face of adversity that forms a safety net for those they care for most. And I can see where these women equate to those in Dickens’ story as well. This makes for a bit of fun, but you surely don’t need to read his book to understand this one. It just adds another level perhaps. There’s even a passage in here where Demon nods to that famous work.“I had to do the harder English, which was a time suck, reading books. Some of them though, I finished without meaning to… Likewise the Charles Dickens one, seriously older guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over and nobody giving a rat’s ass. You’d think he was from around here.”I’ll say that this is an important topic to explore. Personally, it would work better if it had been edited more thoroughly. Yes, a shorter story can still make a huge impact. I also think a non-fiction piece on the opioid crisis would be a lot more effective for me. I know they are out there, and I will explore that option more thoroughly. Now, would I have loved this more if Richard Armitage had been reading it to me as he didDavid Copperfield? Damn straight I would have!! He could have read another 500 pages of this one to me and I’d have been content.“It hit me pretty hard, how there’s no kind of sad in this world that will stop it turning.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Demon Copperhead deserves every fiction prize there is. Every single one of them. Even the ones that don\'t exist.Many years ago, shortly after I started working at my library, I mentioned to a colleague I had a headache.""Mabel"", sweet and helpful as ever, said to come back to her desk and she\'d give me something for it. She pulled out a gallon-size Ziploc bag (that\'s almost 4 liters, for all the non-United Statians reading this).Mabel asked me what kind did I want. \'Um, ibuprofen?\' I queried, not seeing anything but orange prescription bottles in that see-through plastic bag.She looked at me and said she didn\'t have it but any of these pills would help a lot more than ibuprofen would.I declined, worried to take prescription painkillers. I worried forher, seeing that big ol\' bag.""You don\'t take all of these,do you, Mabel?"", I asked.She said well of course she did,\xa0""Jenna, when you get old, you get a lot of different pains and each of these are for a different one"".With that, Mabel began pulling out bottles, reading the labels as she did. ""This here\'s for my neck. This for my back. Oh, this is the best, it helps my arthritis,"" she said, shaking a bottle of Oxys.She continued pulling out bottles, lining them up on the edge of her desk. I thinkjust about every part of her body hurt and every part of her body had its own pill.A white-haired, intelligent, professionally employed woman, Mabel wasn\'t your stereotypical addict. She had been a librarian for decades, the favorite of most of our patrons. But,like every other pain pill addict I knew, Mabel\'s addiction began in the doctor\'s office.She wasn\'t some lowlife just looking to get high. She trusted her doctors and believed them that you couldn\'t get addicted if you really had pain.There are so many stories about addiction, some true, some based on the truth. Mabel, while not her real name, was a real person with a real addiction that probably killer her (she had a brain aneurysm which are often brought on by opioids). Not all stories have happy endings.As for this book and this story, I loved it. Loved it in so many ways and for so many reasons. Barbara Kingsolver, being Appalachian, ""gets"" Appalachians, us hillbillies. She writes with so much authenticity.These characters? I know them. They live down the street, they come in the library, they shop at Walmart, pushing their ""buggies"" full of sugar drinks and sugar cereals, trying to get the most amount of calories for their kids for the least amount of dollars.Ms. Kingsolver also ""gets"" the pain pill/heroin epidemic, how and why it started, and how greedy pharmaceutical CEOs and everyone under them, down to both the equally greedy doctors and the well-meaning but witless ones, destroyed hundreds of thousands of lives.There is a lot about addiction in these pages, but there\'s so much more than that. It is real and deep and emotional andrip-your-heart-out stuff. It is whatHillbilly Elegycould have been if JD Vance wasn\'t such a stuck on himself braggart asshole.Young Demon Copperhead had me from the very first page.I knew this kid, I\'d seen him grow\xa0up, and watched him grow up all over again through the pages of this book. I cannot praise it highly enough, trite as those words are. It\'s difficult to find words to describe it - again trite, but the truth.If you want a book that is going to suck you in and hold you rapt and take you on a roller coaster of emotions,Demon Copperheadis the book for you. Don\'t be intimidated by the length. As another friend wrote in her review (hey, Diane 👋🏼), ""it needs every word to get this story told.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Who is this Demon Copperhead?? Well, let me tell you: He’s a wild red headed melungeon, whipper snapper of a hillbilly. A young boy with a mind so expansive, how he describes life, is large.Orphaned at 11, Demon’s teenage years are fraught with sadness and hopelessness. Through foster homes, running away and at last finding his grandmother. A life headed to go off the rails, somehow maintained its balance, until it didn’t. As in life, there are tops and bottoms. In Demon’s, the bottom bottoms out with opiates- plundering his chances of making it out of poverty.Demon is a character you will grow attached to and cheer for in his early ages simply for his resilience. But life can be tough and heavy choices are made.Kingsolver, you haven’t lost your touch. This one is epic. This character; this story; the writing. But whoa. It does get dark and heavy for a long part of this journey and it makes one wonder of the helplessness and fear these addicts feel and face in reality.5⭐️Your 2nd story to grace my all time favourites standing next toThe Poisonwood Bible'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5+I am far from the first one to be blown away by this phenomenal book. How can one novel be heart-breaking, beautiful, amazing, poignant, and funny? Barbara Kingsolver lives in these mountains she writes about, this area of southern Appalachia that is a place of immense beauty but which is known more for its poverty, unemployment, and addiction. The Appalachian people, people who are often ridiculed for their rural ways and particular speech.“All down the years, words have been flung like pieces of shit, only to get stuck on a truck bumper with up-yours pride. Rednecks, moonshiners, ridgerunners, hicks, deplorables.”Kingsolver writes from the heart with love and understanding. She has written many fine books but, in my opinion, this is her best since The Poisonwood Bible.Rather than retell the story (No! No! Please don’t!), I will share some of my favorite quotes. Please realize these are just a sampling of the many I might have included.“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end up with nothing, and lose so much.”“I wanted to go home, which was nowhere, but it’s a feeling you keep having, even after that’s no place anymore.”“I’d live long enough to know shit doesn’t bounce off.”“Certain pitiful souls around here see whiteness as their last asset that hasn’t been totaled or repossessed.”“A junkie catches his flight. That sugar on your brain cells sucks away any other purpose. The human person you were gets yanked out through whatever hole the devil can find.”“I thought about what Rose said, wanting to see the rest of us hurt, because she was hurting. You have to wonder how much of this whole world’s turning is fueled by that very fire.”“That’s the deal of sober life: celebrate the fresh start, suck up your sadness for all that was left behind”.I hope those who haven’t read this masterpiece will love it too.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Smart, surprising, poignant, powerful, wrenching, and wonderful. So deeply moving. I will never write a novel this good. Drop the mic, Barbara Kingsolver, drop the mic.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'This started well and within 50 pages was exactly what I was hoping it would be, an eye-opening unflinching look at something I’d never thought about before – foster care in Appalachia. I love big socially crusading novels! Turns out that in Virginia in the 90s foster care = child exploitation. Either you cash the DSS cheque and starve them (simple version) or you cash the DSS cheque, starve them and make them work eight hour shifts after school doing some crippling job no one else would do (sophisticated version).That part of the book was great. Then like a drug deal where they all end up dead it went bad real quick.To get to the second Big Issue thatDemon Copperheadwas going to deal with, which is the very famous American opioid addiction crisis, we follow our sparky poor white trash kid through his rescue from the horrible exploiters and his adoption by the local school football coach whose name is Coach and his month by month growing up into an aggravating smart-mouthed kid with all the usual preoccupations of girls, dope, drink and cartooning (and people who have zero interest in American football might want to know that there are many pages devoted to the subject), and it turns out that as soon as this poor kid stops being pounded on and tortured quite so much he becomes very tiresome very quickly. I had been told by reviewers in some big fat newspapers that this was a page turner and had a propulsive plot that never stopped. They lied. The plot keels over onto live support around page 150.But it wasn’t really the wheezing broke-down plot that was the problem. I jacked in this Pulitzer Prizewinning but not Booker Prize longlisted novel because I could not stand this kid’s voice. Every sentence is crammed with quippy slangy smartarseness. This kid is drenched in rueful self-awareness, wagging his head sorrowfully yet smirkily yet self-deprecatingly, and he never goes to a party or a funeral without describing everybody there & their relation to everybody else & what they were wearing and what they were drinking and what car they were driving or would want to have been driving. This kid thinks he’s wise and funny. He doesn’t seem to think he’s very annoying. And neither does Barbara Kingsolver. He is always saying stuff likeGood people, bad people, what does that even mean? Get down to the rock and the hard place, and we’re all just soft flesh and the weapon at hand.Voice is crucial to a book in the first person and it’s not easy to get right. Raymond Chandler does, DBC Pierre doesn’t, Irvine Welsh does, JD Salinger doesn’t, Charles Dickens does. My does might be your doesn’t. But if you are one of the many who think Barbara Kingsolver does get it right, then it’s your lucky day, because there’s 548 small-type pages of it.The reviewer deciding to give upDemon Copperhead'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""3.75⭐*Joint Winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction with Hernan Diaz's Trust **Winner of the 2023 Women’s Prize for Fiction*“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between.”A retelling of David Copperfield by Charles Dickens, in a contemporary Southern Appalachian setting,Demon CopperheadbyBarbara Kingsolveris a powerful work of fiction. Part coming of age, part social commentary, the narrative revolves around the eponymous Demon Copperhead, born Damon Fields, (named after his father Damon, who died from an accident before his birth, earning the nickname “Copperhead” on account of his copper wire hair) to an addict mother in a trailer park in Lee County, Virginia. We follow Demon from his childhood through his early adulthood, as he grapples with poverty, loss, abuse, loneliness, and short-lived moments of hope and success as a young athlete with college dreams before an injury derails his plans and his struggle with addiction and substance abuse. Narrated in the first person by Demon, as he shares his perspective on the people and events that shape his life and his worldview, this is a story of grief, resilience and ultimately the search for a sense of belongingness and the will to survive when the odds are stacked against you.“It hit me pretty hard, how there’s no kind of sad in this world that will stop it turning. People will keep on wanting what they want, and you’re on your own.”Rather than compare this novel to the classic that inspired this story, I prefer to discuss what I felt about this book based on its individual merit.There is a lot to unpack here. The author writes with compassion in simple yet elegant prose. Barbara Kingsolver not only paints the picture of the lives of those caught up in a vicious cycle of poverty, neglect and addiction, the Opioid Crisis in particular but also takes a grim look at issues such as parental negligence, child abuse and the foster care system among others. The characterizations are superb and the author skillfully weaves a large cast of distinctive characters into the narrative without it becoming overwhelming or too difficult to follow. The author also addresses how outsiders harbor certain preconceived notions about certain communities without totally understanding the challenges they face.I was engrossed in Demon's journey for the first half of this novel, after which the repetitiveness caused the pace to falter but it does pick up in the last quarter of the story. There are segments in the narrative that I felt were unnecessarily detailed and could have been shorter without affecting the overall impact of the novel.Though the story is dark and depressing for the most part, it is peppered with moments of humor and hope amid the bleakness that pervades Demon’s life and ends on a hopeful note.This was my first Barbara Kingsolver novel and I look forward to exploring more of her work.“But where did it come from, this wanting disease? From how I got born, or the ones that made me, or the crowd I ran with later? Everybody warns about bad influences, but it’s these things already inside you that are going to take you down. The restlessness in your gut, like tomcats gone stupid with their blood feuds, prowling around in the moon- dead dark. The hopeless wishes that won’t quit stalking you: some perfect words you think you could say to somebody to make them see you, and love you, and stay.”""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I know some readers want a novel to be concise, revised down to your basic 300-ish pages, but what a luxurious feeling it is when you find yourself more than 300 pages into a book that is really engaging, with characters you truly care about, and realize there are more than 500 pages left to go. You get to know the people in these books better, maybe see them grow over a longer period of time. You get to know the whole world of the book better. But that makes it even sadder when you finish it.I loved this book, a modern Appalachian retelling of David Copperfield, another very long book that I really liked. Kingsolver is good at both seriousness and playfulness, as Dickens was, and she cares deeply about backwoods, rocky Virginia. This works for me, too- I never lived in Appalachia, but I have deep family roots in West Virginia, and I care about that part of the world. I got invested in young Demon (a nickname for Damon) quickly and cared about him all the way through. Even when he makes awful mistakes in this book, he’s a loving person, and I think his worst mistakes are made out of love. He’s good at making connections with people who might save him, too, and he’s generous with the people in his life even when things are unbelievably hard. I like how Demon, even when he’s going through something terrible, notices and is buoyed by the beauty of the natural world. The sense of place is strong in this book. The characters are even stronger, and you care about them deeply as they suffer in the eye of the opioid storm that still wracks our country. I’ve read almost all of Kingsolver’s books, and I think this has replaced The Poisonwood Bible as my favorite. As always when I’m truly loving a book, I worried about the ending. Would the author stick the landing? I am haunted by the ghosts of a few books that just lost it at the end. But she stuck the landing! I love where the book ends.Now I kind of feel like going back and rereading David Copperfield? It’s been a while. Thanks to NetGalley for giving me early access to my favorite book of the year.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'The excellent cover design first drew me to this book. I thought a modern adaptation of the classic David Copperfield would be a formidable task. When I saw it was written by Barbara Kingsolver, who wrote three of my favourite books, all wildly different in theme and location, The Poisonwood Bible, The Lacuna, and Flight Behaviour, I knew I wanted to purchase and read this. This is unlike her other books that enthralled me. It is an epic tale (over 600 pages) and a fabulous read. Its characters, the good, the wicked, the uncaring, and the disinterested, will stay in my memory for a long time.Demon (Damon) Copperhead was born to a teenage, addicted mother on the floor of her trailer. They faced extreme poverty in the Appalachian mountains of Virginia. The story follows Demon from his birth to young manhood. The writing is exquisite, although describing dark and disturbing circumstances. Demon narrates his life story, often with a sardonic sense of humour about deplorable situations. His father died before his birth, and Demon inherited his father\'s good looks and flaming red hair (Copperhead). His mother remarried a vile, abusive, violent man. Kindly neighbours, the Piggotts, were an early refuge for him, and the family also cared for other orphaned or forgotten children from dead or absent relatives.At age ten, Demon finds himself in the foster system when his mother dies. The system\'s workers were overburdened and usually uncaring, overlooking terrible situations where they placed their charges. He finds himself working on a farm with several orphaned boys, treated as slave labour, poisoned by the sap from tobacco plants, and nearly starved. Then he is moved to the McCobbs, sleeping in a dog\'s room, and expected to earn money by working outside the home to supplement the family\'s income. He rarely can attend school, and when he does, it reinforces his low self-esteem. Always hungry and poorly dressed, he is shunned by his classmates. He works in the trash after school and seldom is clean.Things start to look better when he moves into the home of a football coach who is determined to make a football player out of Demon for his winning team. He feels unworthy even in his short glory days as a football player. A painful injury on the sports field ends his brief football career and starts him on pain medication and the road to addiction. He becomes friends with Angus, the coach\'s teenager.Demon becomes reacquainted with an old friend from the miserable farm where they both laboured. This friend works for a local newspaper laying out ads and cartoon strips. Demon helps him by creating a superhero from the Appalachian region, as all the superheroes are drawn with their exploits in cities. The cartoon strip became very popular and is syndicated to other regional papers. One kindly art teacher recognizes Demon\'s talent for drawing cartoons and supports his efforts.However, things are going badly for Demon outside the newspaper office. He has married a girl he thinks is adorable. She is clingy and needy, will not cook or clean the house, and appliances have long stopped functioning. They live in filthy, nasty conditions, and she has fallen deep into drug addiction. She becomes distraught and angry if he leaves home to run errands or go to work. His memories of earlier injustices and poverty flood his mind and emotions with despair.His old friends are now part of the opioid and meth crisis, and Demon joins them. His best friend from the Piggott home is far into drugs and weird Gothic dress, and he and the once popular QB football hero are dealing. Former friends start dying from overdoses and reckless behaviour. Are there any supportive people who will save some of the addicted youth? Will Demon find a way out of his tragic past?We learn something about the region\'s history, the coal mining, those impoverished, marginalized people scorned by others and designated hillbillies and rednecks. ( a word with an interesting origin),and with social situations little improved since the time of Charles Dickens.Demon comments on David Copperfield, one of the few books he managed to read in school, "" The Charles Dickens one seriously old guy, dead and a foreigner, but Christ Jesus did he get the picture on kids and orphans getting screwed over, and nobody gives a rat\'s ass.

The fortuitous link to my favorite Dickens novel (David Copperfield)! The promise of one of my favorite genres, coming-of-age!Alas, it was not to be. At least not for me.It fell into that category of book that for some reason bothers me. The plot’s the thing, and we all love a good story. As for Kingsolver, she’s certainly capable of telling it. Trouble is, she told way more than I like. Not many “stop and zoom in” scenes. More ""this happened, then that happened."" And time rolls on as the narrative years slip by.Guess I’d rather read a book that covers all of a day or a weekend only. That’s me. These year-jumpers tend to leave characterization in the dust. That is, the characters have no soul, and when they have no soul, I have trouble investing (making the book bankrupt as a Silicon Valley Bank, if you’ll forgive the current event metaphor).In fairness, you can dismiss this review because I DNF, but I did make it to page 380 or so, and that’s more than halfway, by God, but I struggled to return to it each time I put it down. Instead, I looked at other books on my TBR shelf and they mocked me for pledging my allegiance in such a rote way. Soon I caved to the Sirens of “Life’s Too Short.”I don\'t feelthatbad. Demon seems to be doing just fine and meeting unusual success and winning over all the girls and facing all the modern troubles (like opioids) David C. didn’t have to and I wish him well. But he really lacked depth. And the surrounding characters didn\'t sweep me off my feet, either, meaning I was always aware of my surroundings while reading (never a good thing -- consider the movie theater when the same thing happens while viewing!).So cue the music by the men in Wayfarer sunglasses (“I’m a Soul Man”) and forgive me not joining the Kingsolver parade. I’ll leave the 5-stars and hosannas to others with their marching band reviews.Instead, I’ll be one of the outsiders giving this a two.

You’d think that he was from around here.”A modern retelling of Charles Dickens\'s David Copperfield bildungsroman set in the Appalachian Mountains, where you are plunged into a harsh and unforgiving world of institutional poverty, addiction, and social injustice. Through the eyes of Damon Fields, nicknamed ""Demon Copperhead,"" Kingsolver exposes the dark underbelly of modern American society with a raw and visceral prose, with a bleak and apocalyptic vision of the world that is both terrifying and all too familiar.“Once a time I was something, and then I turned, like sour milk. The dead junkie’s kid. A rotten piece of American pie that everybody wishes could just be, you know. Removed.”Kingsolver\'s sprawling narrative weaves together a complex tapestry of characters and storylines that reflect the harsh realities of contemporary life. Her storyline is unflinching, painting a picture of a society that has lost its way and is struggling to find its moral compass; a long tradition of suffering that divides and isolates. Kingsolver\'s socio-political message is complemented by the splendid prose and southern undertones which contribute to the realistic representation of the simple, ordinary life of the mind of a teenage boy and his upbringing in the harsh Appalachian environment.This is a heartfelt exploration of the search for meaning in a chaotic word. The fate of Demon, a throwdown of shame, a cesspool of self-pity, will intersect with that of many others, echoing the stories of all those haunted by the ghosts of a repressive past.“The wonder is that you could start life with nothing, end with nothing, and lose so much in between.”In the end, as you embark on this journey with Demon through loss of innocence, alienation, isolation, cynicism, but also of fortitude and perseverance, you are reminded of the timeless truths that lie at the heart of all great stories.“…a good story doesn’t copy life, it pushes back on it.”Brillant!4.75/5'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'In a Nutshell:A contemporary retelling of the Dickens’ epic, ‘David Copperfield’. True to the original in flow, but the rest left me with mostly negative feelings. Outlier opinion coming up.Story Synopsis:Think ‘David Copperfield’ in a modern-day hillbilly setting.Damon Fields was born to a teenage druggie mom in a trailer home. Because of the colour of his hair and his attitude towards life and people, he is nicknamed ‘Demon Copperhead.’ As Demon grows up in Lee County in the Virginian Appalachian region, he fights against his destiny and tries to make something of himself, though the odds keep going against him.The story comes to us in the first person perspective of Demon.I remember the dilemma I had faced while reviewingLan Samantha Chang’s The Family Chao, which was a modern-day retelling of Dostoevsky’sThe Brothers Karamazov. While her adaptation had been faithful to the original, the classic itself was not suitable to a modernisation by virtue of its themes and its philosophy. This made her novel seem highly stereotypical and even offensive.I face a similar conundrum this time, thoughCharles Dickens’ classic ‘David Copperfield’is much more flexible towards an updated retelling because of its universal themes.If you have read the original epic, you will notice how faithfully and brilliantly Barbara Kingsolver has transported the characters to the Appalachian mountains. All the characters get a similar deal as in the original, albeit through a different approach thanks to the change in era and setting.The characters have been given somewhat similar names as their older counterparts. Murdstone becomes Muller Stone, Steerforth becomes Sterling ford, Dora turns into Dori, Tommy Traddles is now Tommy Waddell… This kind of writing choice makes it very easy for us to remember whom each new character is based upon. (That said, I was not at all happy to see my favourite Agnes being changed to ‘Angus’.)David Copperfield was the titular character’s coming-of-age story; Demon Copperhead is also a bindungsroman for its eponymous lead. Both characters are equally gutsy and equally judgemental. Both want to succeed despite the lemons life keeps throwing at them, and contrary to expectations, they do end up carving a niche for themselves in this haphazard world.The plot is also faithful to the original. No one’s destiny changes paths just because of the modernisation. This is both good and bad. Good because I really respect authors who retain the spirit of the original in their retellings. (There’s no point calling a work a retelling if you retain nothing of the base work except the character names, right?) Bad because you already know what’s going to happen to every single one of them!In other words, as a retelling, this book rates pretty high because it sticks to the format and still gives it enough of a twist to make it stand on its own as an independent work.Where the book failed for me is in its tawdry portrayal of the mountain people. Don’t get me wrong. Kingsolver is a master at settings, and this book is no exception. The mountains of Lee County come alive through her beautiful descriptions. But it was somewhat disappointing to see every possible stereotype about the locals make its way into this book. This is somewhat ironic because Demon tells us multiple times how he feels upset about the stereotypes outsiders have about his people, and then he goes on to live a life reiterating every single cliché through his own deeds, which sounds even worse when heard in first person. Drugs, alcohol, sex, cuss words, poverty, physical violence, domestic violence, social backwardness, racial discrimination ,… you name it and it is there in this book. I am not going to remark on how much of this might be based on reality as I have no first-hand experience of that culture and hence have no right to judge. But from the way it was portrayed, I got hardly any good vibes about the community, and that it is a sure sign that only hackneyed ideas were being thrown at us.Dickens’ work was also somewhat “misery porn” in style and slightly offensive against those not “physically perfect.” But as David Copperfield was written in the late 1840s, it gets away with this outdated style of writing. Demon Copperhead cannot use the era as an excuse. As it is a retelling, I am also taken aback by the amount of vulgarity in the story. This might not bother most readers, but to me, inserting crude content into a favourite classic story was akin to blasphemy.How would you feel about this book without knowing the original? Well, you might like it better as you won’t keep comparing the two works and will read this one on its own merit. So if you are okay with the ribald content and the vapid portrayal of the hillbilly people, this story *might* work better for you. Then again, the book is needlessly lengthy, because it skips nothing from the original plot. The start is appealing, but the middle is quite repetitive. The story stays stuck in this looped narrative until almost the very end, by which time I had lost all my patience with it.To me, the book feels like an epic writing achievement in some ways, transporting 1800s upper class London to a modern hillbilly setting. But in most other ways, it feels so unbelievably flat and so offensive to the original as well as to the contemporary dwellers of the location that I cannot endorse it wholeheartedly.2.5 stars, rounding down because I expected far more from Ms. Kingsolver.Do note that this is very much an outlier review. So please read other reviews and take a call on this joint-winner of the 2023 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Connect with me through:My Blog|The StoryGraph|Instagram|Facebook|Twitter'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5+ stars!2023 Favourites List!Demon Copperhead is a ten-year-old boy living in a single wide trailer with his young mother in the back Holler of the Appalachian mountains in Virginia. This is Demon’s story. He tells his story starting from the day he was born to a teenage mother too young to know anything about parenting and too focused on getting her next fix of alcohol, drugs and bad men. Demon chronicles his life of poverty, foster care, crime, filth, abuse and loneliness. There are bright spots throughout the way, but nothing that could shine clear through the constant neglect and heartbreak this young boy faces.As dark and disturbing as this story is, it was a phenomenal reading experience for me. Truly - it was an exceptional and outstanding novel that surpassed any expectation I had. For me, the most stand out aspect was the narrative. Demon’s voice is one I’ll never forget. The author created a fascinating, impactful, endearing and heartbreaking character in Demon, giving him a voice that sent his story right to my heart. Demon’s narrative is raw and gritty. It’s filled with slang and backwoods grammar. It’s authentic and real and had me enraptured. There were many sentences of tender raw honesty from Demon that went straight to my heart.You’ll be able to quickly decide if this book is for you based on how you feel about Demon’s narrative. If you don’t connect with his voice and backwoods drawl within the first few pages, this won’t be for you.There is so much that happens within these pages. It is a dark, gritty, heartbreaking read. The endless cycle of poverty and abuse is depressing but a reality many children face. I appreciate getting this harrowing glance into this life as it makes me even more thankful for what I have and encourages me to help others as much as possible.Overall, this was a remarkable book that I highly recommend! I hope you connect with Demon’s story as much as I did.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""First, I got myself born. A decent crowd was on hand to watch, and they\'ve always given me that much: the worst of the job was up to me, my mother being let\'s just say out of it.""I knew from that first sentence I would love this book. I knew by page 50 that it would be five stars, by page 75 my favorite book of the year. Having finished, I\'m moving it up to one of my lifetime favorite books. It really is that good, that moving, that perfect. That\'s a lot from an author that had disappointed me with her last few books. Kingsolver never got past her wonderful Poisonwood Bible success with me, and after a couple of later books, I just gave up on her. I wanted to try this because of the David Copperfield connection. I last read that in high school,many long years ago, but give Dickens credit, I still remembered the plot and the characters, and of course, their names. Kingsolver takes David/Demon and plops him down in present day Appalachia, and never misses a beat. Having said that, even if you never even heard of David Copperfield, this is a great novel on its own.I\'ll let the GR blurb give you the basics. Just get this book in your hands and read it. I will even go so far as to say it will probably win everything, certainly the National Book Award, most likely the Pulitzer. It will certainly win your heart. I got mine from the library, but will buy a copy when it comes out in paperback. Don\'t let the fact that it\'s 540+ pages deter you, it needs every word to get this story told.Now I need to reread David Copperfield, just for the icing on the cake.'}]"

",Gabrielle Zevin,4.14,1083674,3628,"Fiction, Contemporary, Romance, Audiobook, Literary Fiction, Adult, Historical Fiction",401,05-07-2022,"In this exhilarating novel, two friends—often in love, but never lovers—come together as creative partners in the world of video game design, where success brings them fame, joy, tragedy, duplicity, and, ultimately, a kind of immortality.On a bitter-cold day, in the December of his junior year at Harvard, Sam Masur exits a subway car and sees, amid the hordes of people waiting on the platform, Sadie Green. He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom. These friends, intimates since childhood, borrow money, beg favors, and, before even graduating college, they have created their first blockbuster,Ichigo. Overnight, the world is theirs. Not even twenty-five years old, Sam and Sadie are brilliant, successful, and rich, but these qualities won't protect them from their own creative ambitions or the betrayals of their hearts.Spanning thirty years, from Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Venice Beach, California, and lands in between and far beyond, Gabrielle Zevin'sTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowis a dazzling and intricately imagined novel that examines the multifarious nature of identity, disability, failure, the redemptive possibilities in play, and above all, our need to connect: to be loved and to love. Yes, it is a love story, but it is not one you have read before.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'This is one of those well-lauded books that I felt a bit hesitant going in. I assumed it was targeted for a certain audience—either those who gravitate towards stories about complicated friendships, or gamers. I\'m not sure either of those are me, so what would I get out of it?And when I first started, I thought for sure I\'d made a mistake. The first chapter was so overwritten, coming across as both pretentious and off-putting, and I cringed my way through it. I thought to myself, this is it. The book that everyone loves, I\'d either have to give up on or end up writing a lowly-rated review and be subjected to comments about brain deficiency.I took a break and then decided to give it another chance. Chapter 2 was a little bit better. And then we come to Chapter 3, and bam! I was hooked. It\'s not an understatement to say that the scene with Dov teaching the Advanced Games seminar class was my favorite of the whole book and it\'s what sold me on reading it.From then on, every moment related to designing or making video games, I was totally there for. Before I started, if you\'d told me that that would be the part I\'d enjoy the most, I would\'ve been surprised. I wouldn\'t categorize myself as a gamer since I\'ve probably only loved one video game my whole life. (That wasAnimal Crossing, first on the GameCube and then almost 20 years later asAnimal Crossing: New Horizonson the Switch.)But then when I think about it, I shouldn\'t have been surprised. The way this book talks about games, they\'re really presented as more like stories, albeit ones where the reader can participate in and influence the direction and outcome. And I\'m certainly a reader of the most passionate sort.I\'m also a software engineer with a little bit of experience making video games on the side, so of course the technical aspects of Sam and Sadie\'s ventures totally appealed to me. Reading about their projects is more or less like reading about work—which I normally avoid like the plague—but somehow this book made it exciting.I can\'t help but wish the games were real. I want to play them and capture the feelings reading about them evoked in me. And I also want to know everything that went into making them. If this were a biography on a real video game company, I would\'ve loved it from cover to cover and completely gobbled it up.But it wasn\'t, and as a result, this wasn\'t a perfect story for me. It very much centers around Sam and Sadie\'s friendship, and that was pretty much the weakest part. I didn\'t really connect with either of the characters. All their issues were the result of the dreaded miscommunication trope, where one or the other refuses to say what they mean, leading to misunderstandings. And this went on and on, through many years.My other issue with the story is that it includes a certain development that comes out of nowhere, seemingly for no other reason than to beat down the characters, thus eliciting tugs of the heartstrings and upping the emotional ante. And I\'m just not a fan. It doesn\'t add anything to the story and it left me feeling somewhat emotionally manipulated.I also have to point out that the story at times feels like it\'s a bit too clever with its verbiage. Like at one point, this book conjured up the only two literary characters who know what ""jejune"" means and put them in a conversation with each other. While that\'s an impressive use of the thesaurus, it detracts a bit from the story being told.But I don\'t think my experience with the book is typical. A lot of other readers praise the depiction of Sam and Sadie\'s relationship and declare their love for the book despite the video game segments. I\'m pretty much the complete opposite. But even coming from two different directions, it seems we have all reached the same conclusion, and that\'s our collective enjoyment for this supremely interesting story. And in the end, that\'s all that really matters.~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

I would have if the beginning hadn’t been so beautifully done. There’s a line in the book about a video game sequel being awful because it was farmed out to Indian programmers who had no interest in the game and that’s how this book feels after the incredible start. The beginning was layered, nuanced and artfully done. I hate flashbacks but this book had managed to layer the present, past and future in such an incredible way before it fell off a cliff and suddenly feels like an entirely different writer took over.The story began with Sadie and Sam central to the story. We found out about them in a narrative that skipped around in time to let us understand them and their relationship. Sam was the obviously the more sympathetic of the two and the one you as a reader care about. Sadie was often annoying and then fell apart in a ridiculous way. I hoped her awful college self with the horrible college boyfriend would evolve and grow up but she never does. Even worse for the story is the tangents that from that point became the story. We suddenly get a new character who is rightly called boring later on. He is a NPC. He’s just too good and uninteresting to take up so much space. We get his backstory we don’t need. In a similar way later on we get two new characters that happen to be gay that bring nothing to the story other than a celebration of their sexuality which apparently is worth their inclusion. Much like tangents about their game that take up unnecessary page time and continue to dilute any attempt at storytelling. There’s plenty of politics, even to a ridiculously degree like actual comical bad guys intent on violence against those in favor of gay relationships and marriage. Ironically for a book full of wokeness with characters never being straight, celebrating gender fluidity, the book managed to ridicule cultural appropriation. The book is very focused on the race of the characters but never explores them in more than a superficial way.One of the author’s worst faults was her pretentious word choices. Instead of writing in way that flowed she chose to constantly check her thesaurus for jarring words like jejune and verdigris every couple of pages. Ironically much like the criticism of a game her character created this book is pretentious and full of itself. The worst part is that could have been amazing if it had stayed as focused as it was in the beginning. This is not a story worth the journey so do not push play. I received a complimentary copy of this book. Opinions expressed in this review are completely my own.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow I will still be thinking about this brilliant book.Fair warning that I am predisposed to adore coming-of-age novels about protagonists of my generation (Gen X), apparently even if I don’t have much in common with them other than birth year. In this case, the protagonists are Sadie and Sam, two friends whose lives intertwine up, down, and around their love of gaming.It must be said that this book is VERY MUCH about video games. Sadie and Sam play them, talk about them, design them, and promote them over the span of thirty years. What a testament to author Gabrielle Zevin’s writing that I could be glued to the pages of a story about a topic that typically bores me to tears! Because I loved Sadie and Sam so much, I never lost interest in their worlds - either the real one of their day-to-day existence or the virtual ones they were building.They are, without a doubt in my mind, the two characters I’ve cared about the most over the past decade of my reading life.I do say that with a bit of trepidation, as I know some readers of this review who love me (shout out to my mom again!) will want to read Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow to meet my new literary best friends. I must therefore point out that while the novel is a masterpiece in my eyes, some people are not going to be able to get through it. Zevin is a fan of obscure words, there are risky techniques used (such as an occasional second-person chapter and dropping readers into a video game world), sad and unsavory things happen in the plot, and the text is fairly dense. This is a long 416 pages.Also, having read (and enjoyed) Zevin’s previous two novels, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry and Young Jane Young, this feels like it’s from an entirely different author. I breezed through those others in a day, but Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow took me a week. I know that’s because I savored every word and often reread entire paragraphs, but that’s my point. If her prior books were hamburgers, this one is a steak.I feel a bit bad for the upcoming books I’ll be reading in the wake of this novel, since I know nothing will compare for a very long time. In case it’s not clear enough already, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow has a well-earned place on my all-time favorites shelf.

Because, as the blurb stated, this was essentially a book about two good friends making a video game together.But was it?Not gonna lie, I wasn't sure where I would land on this when I decided to pick up late via BOTM add-on. (See, I even skipped over it when it was one of the monthly picks).Despite being a child of the 80's and 90's, I never played videogames. I know, I know...the horror, some of you might be thinking. But, whelp, my dad was adamantly against us playing them, convinced it would make us lazy and turn our minds into mush.Well, while I can't say that I'mnotlazy or that my mindisn'tmush despite never being a gamer, Icansay that, based on the one or two times I played it at a friends' house, Ireallysucked atMario Kartanyway.But I digress.Like I said, never having been a gamer, I was worried about how that might play into my enjoyment of a book which, on the surface, was centered around video games.But again...was it really?Yes and no.This was about so much more than video games, folks. So much more than standard friendship. I can't even explain what I mean here...It just encapsulated so much of the human experience in such a bold, yet nuanced way.In today's western culture--which is seemingly insistent uponeverythinghaving to be a social justice/political statement that slams you over the head on exhausting repeat--the way this book handled said topics felt...organic.Showing not telling.Allowing me toabsorbthe message instead of simply beating me over the head with self-righteousness.So refreshing.Also, there are so many elements of the book that felt personal to me...that struck a chord with me. I won't get into them; but, suffice to say that, again, this book was very much about the human experience. And the way the author used video games as a platform for it all was super creative. And super well executed, in my opinion.Originally, I rated this 4.5 instead of 5 stars; however, I've thought about this book a lot since finishing it several days ago. And anything that makes me self-reflect...that moves me enough to contemplate the facets of it days later...deserves the full five.P.S. You don't need to be a gamer to love this book.P.P.S.

I\'ve loved Zevin\'s books in the past and I was lured in by some of the early starred reviews that promised I would be enchanted by this book. I can see the many interesting themes the author is juggling here and have highlighted a few passages I thought were noteworthy, yet a few moments of brilliance just couldn\'t make this book any less tedious for me.The story is essentially about gamers and video games, throwing up constant references to the history of gaming and gaming culture. The two main characters, Sadie and Sam, bond over playing video games when the pair meet in the children\'s ward of a hospital and later conceive of, and program, games of their own. Their own personal stories-- involving family, friends, sexism in the industry and abusive relationships (contains emotional manipulation and sexual assault) play out alongside this.I will confess that maybe it is just my disinterest in the world of gaming that drives my apathy towards this story. I have played my fair share of certain games-- caught them all in Pokemon, explored the worlds of Final Fantasy VII onwards, built a fabulous neighbourhood in Sims, employed some questionable antics in Grand Theft Auto and, to a lesser extent, tried my hand at Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and The Last of Us.That being said, I do not consider ""gamer"" to be a defining term for me. I would always rather read. And my interest in games does not extend beyond the games to the culture surrounding it.Kirkus assured me that even those who ""have never played a video game in their lives"" will love this book, but I feel like that probably isn\'t true. I found it a struggle just to make it through and I kept finding excuses to check my email, google something random that occurred to me, or just do household chores instead of reading this.Some people have commented on it being a long book, but 400 pages isn\'t all that long.

Particularly interesting to me was the genuineness of the content concerning game design and production.Unfortunately, as someone who has spent a large portion of their adult life working in the gaming industry, I found the protagonists' talks of game design and development outside the scope of their debut game Ichigo to be tedious.The story was dull and I found the author's constant urge to stay\xa0woke\xa0to be obnoxious.

The book is well-written with a lot of heart. From the moment the characters meet in chapter 2, I loved their friendship.

This is something that would appeal to any creative person, regardless if you're a video game designer or not. I was not a fan of certain romantic developments, since they were unnecessary and felt like an easy way to create drama, but still very solid overall.My thoughts now: I'm disappointed that Zevin didn't give credit to Brenda Romero's undistributed game, 'Train,' when she gave credit to plenty of other game creators in her acknowledgements. It wouldn't have been difficult to simply add another name, and crediting wouldn't have detracted from the story either. It's sadly ironic that for a story about women being underrepresented and overlooked in the gaming industry, the author would do the same to Romero. Doubly disappointing is Zevin's ties to Hadassah, a US-based Zionist women's organization. I'd hoped that the mention of Israel in the book was because Zevin wanted to add more flaws to her antagonist character, but it appears that she shares the same beliefs.

Zevin\'s descriptions of the process, so technical, transport the reader into an imaginary world so vast that at one point, i saw myself in the game sam and sadie made. additionally, i salute the author\'s courage to include difficult literary techniques (e.g.: second-person pov) in an already intricate setting.ultimately, the brilliance of this book comes from its characters. i don\'t think i have cared for characters this deeply sinceAlone With You in the Ether. sam, sadie, and marx are written with depth and empathy. they evolve like real people would, for better and worse. their humanity shines through the tragedies, pulling me into their suffering: that\'s how i know that characterization can only go so far. this is what differentiates unpleasantly brilliant books from mediocre but entertaining ones.and god, the intimacy between the three characters. there is something about the chemistry, the interactions, and their thoughts that made me wonder: can love can be greater than this?in the end, i know that this book is absolutely not for everyone, and not everyone who loved and hated this will feel the same emotions throughout the experience. for now, i leave this book at 4.5 (it will change eventually) butTomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrowwill stay in my mind and my heart for a long time.--------------------------pre-review:this book induces in me such profound grief, that i am feeling physically unwell.rtc once i recover'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'So I found this book very entertaining and easy to read and also disappointing at times too. Starting with what I enjoyed about the book, I found the prose so readable. Gabrielle Zevin has a knack for telling a good story and about 100 pages in, I felt immersed in her characters’ lives in a way that only some of the best writers can execute. There’s a slice-of-life quality to the storytelling inTomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrowthat helped me feel like I was gliding along with Sam, Sadie, and Marx’s lives from their college years to their early and then approaching mid-adulthood. The video game aspect of the story actually made sense to me and added a quirky touch to the novel that didn’t come across as gimmicky.I also liked the integration of social commentary in this book through the characters’ lives. I felt a lot for Sam and his struggle with his disability and Sadie with her experiences of sexism in the video game industry and in life generally. Zevin does a nice job of showing and not telling so that these elements of social justice/injustice felt organic instead of too obvious or preachy.I think my biggest critique of this book centers on Sam and Sadie’s friendship. I will couch this commentary by saying that I read a lot of literary fiction and it’s one of my favorite genres so my expectations are reasonably high. I found their friendship engaging, though at the same time I don’t think Zevin developed the foundation of their friendship enough to merit all of the conflict and turmoil they experienced. For example, Sam consistently idealizes Sadie throughout the book and is all “I love Sadie Green even though I can’t tell her” and I was like uh why?? Like I get that they had a somewhat intense bonding experience as kids and then they made video games together, but I literally had no clue why Sam actually loved Sadie – she treats him pretty horribly throughout the book as he does to her at times. I get that friends can treat each other poorly, though I struggled to believe Sam and Sadie’s bond given that they get into these intense arguments all the time and then resolve them by… forgetting and forgiving instead of communicating through the conflict and processing what actually happened?? Idk, maybe my best friendships are so healthy to the point where it feels a bit incomprehensible to me (shout-out toBrione of my bestianas who’s also on Goodreads!)As a side note, I think I’m spoiled because I read Jhumpa Lahiri’sThe LowlandandUnaccustomed Earthearlier this year and late last year respectively, and she sets the bar so high in terms of characters with rich inner lives that then manifest in their interpersonal relationships. Hanya Yanagihara pulled this off too inA Little Life, though I don’t recommend her other books lol.I also felt frustrated by the overall treatment of friendship in this novel. For the first 60% or so, there’s this implicit and explicit theme of friendship being important and special and not inferior to romance. However, this deteriorates when certain events happen later on in the book. Like, at the very end, Sam literallysays that he felt insecure that Sadie didn’t want to be with him romantically/physically because of his disability, his Asianness, his lack of wealth… which implies that he actually wanted a romantic relationship with her all along… which undercuts the importance of friendship. YikesLike, Sadie is a white woman from a wealthy background, why did Sam feel so entranced by her?? Idk, it reminds me a bit too much of Asian men who are obsessed with white women’s approval and being attractive to white women instead of loving themselves (likethis tweetdepicts). And I don’t think Zevin sufficiently showed an arc of Sam learning to love himself, even if imperfectly, which would have been my preference even if it’s not everyone’s.Anyway, as you can tell this book was engaging enough that it elicited this long of a review from me. Again, I was entertained and immersed so I can see why so many people hyped this book. Not my favorite though a story with interesting elements and relevant social commentary for sure.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""My first dnf of the year😅 I had so much appreciation for this book while reading it so I can see why so many people love it but I personally was a bit bored tbh.

Sam, whose foot has been crushed in a car accident, hasn't spoken to anyone for months but meeting Sadie, and playing video games with her, brings Sam alive, pulls him out of his pain and heartbreak. That friendship lasts for a while until one of them feels betrayed and then it's over.Eight years later an accidental meeting has them back together. Their love of gaming, their ability to create games, leads to collaboration and the making of games. They are successes at game making but that success pulls them apart again. While the playing field can be even for everyone when they start a video game, giving everyone the same chance to build and conquer, the real world sees everyone differently. One gets more credit than the other, resentments and misunderstandings grow. Even when working together, Sam and Sadie are apart in the most hurtful ways.This is the story of Sam and Sadie but Marx is a part of that story. Marx, who plays games but doesn't make games, becomes a crucial part of Sam and Sadie's company and their lives. Marx is the best friend a person could have, he's the best partner a person could have, he's the mediator when it's needed, he's the glue that holds things together. He's the person Sam tries to imitate when he doesn't know how to go on.This story contains three decades worth of brilliance, creativity, friendship, love, romance. jealousy, resentment, isolation, miscommunication, and more. Maybe some huge successes require people to be somewhat broken and misunderstood. Definitely love does not have to be romantic to last a lifetime. When it comes to Sam and Sadie, it's taken them years and years but I do think they finally mature in the end and there is something to be said for a maturity that might allow estranged people to come back together.There is lots of talk about creating and making games and playing games. Sometimes we are in a game. I loved all of that. I understand gaming and I can get lost in the worlds that allow us to forget our real world. Worlds that allow more than one life, dying doesn't have to mean death, you have more chances to go on or start over. All of that is so interesting to me and I laughed whenever the word dysentery was mentioned. But this story really got to me because there is a lot of sadness, isolation (something gaming can even cause), and anger. I wanted everyone to be able to be a Marx. But that's not how the world works, not everyone can be a Marx, life is not that easy for everyone. I'll be thinking about this story for a long time and will probably see it differently as time goes on. It will take me a while to get over this story, I'll need time to let it just settle in my mind.Pub July 5, 2022""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is my first taste of author Gabrielle Zavin, and I have to say I was impressed, this is beautifully written and smart storytelling that goes back and forth in time, embedded in the world of gaming. I am not a gamer myself, so if you are not either, do not let this put you off, because this is essentially about the all too human aspects and the complexities of what it is to be human, the connections made through this medium, such as the relationships, the friendships and the joyful delight to be found in a perfect digital world, a sharp contrast to the problems and difficulties that are to found in the more messy real world. Sam and Sadie first meet fortuitously in the late 1980s as children in a hospital, finding common ground in playing games, like Super Mario, competitively.Memories comes flooding back when they meet again years later at a rail station as we follow their lives evolving through the decades, as they begin to create games together, setting up in business together, the creative input balanced by the grounding and practical presence of Marx. They do extremely well which brings all the pressures and trappings associated with success. The characters are vivid, distinct and from diverse backgrounds, in a narrative that touches on a wide variety of issues and themes that resonate, like identity, love, loss, family, technology, race, disability, betrayal and inevitable failures, and what is important in life.We are given a insightful glimpse into the gaming industry, its history and business side, and how gaming can help people endure hard times through the escapism it offers. A brilliant and imaginative read that I think will appeal to many readers.

And at the centre - love and friendship of course.“What is a game?"" Marx said. ""It\'s tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow. It\'s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption. The idea that if you keep playing, you could win. No loss is permanent, because nothing is permanent, ever.”The PlotA chance meeting at a hospital is to connect the lives of Sadie and Sam through video gaming and home entertainment. A relationship that is tested, grows, changes, and suffers from many of the obstacles life creates - love, greed, misunderstanding, vanity, discrimination, domestic violence, abuse, death and many more.However, the constant in their lives is the love and ambition for inventing and playing video games. Yet, like many winning partnerships, their loyalty is tested when fame and success enters their lives and the two struggle with each other, despite the intervention of their loyal friend Marx.While the book includes many side stories and sub plots, the core to this book is the relationship between Sadie, Sam and also Marx with some important themes for the reader to reflect on. There is a sad moment in the book that will play on my mind tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!! But I will not spoil here.Review and CommentsIt was all about the writing style and relationships for me that took the meaning of gaming to a whole new level. The characters felt so real and genuine which came through in the writing and turned a seemingly ordinary plot into something extraordinary.My favourite character was Marx although the two characters at the centre of the story were well developed and had such redeeming and less desirable qualities which I loved because this felt ‘real’.There are a few elements to the story that did not work so well for me. For example, using the title and references from Shakespeare’s Macbeth (and others) “Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow” implied there was going to be a connection and relevance to the gaming world. The sense of infinity yes but some of the Shakespeare quotes peppered throughout just didn’t work and at times it felt awkward. Only an opinion.I also believe that my reading experience would have been marginally better had I been more familiar with the gaming jargon. So, I decided to set that aside and focus on the relationships at the centre of the story and only then did the book make sense to me.A modern take on some timeless themes. A story of reinvention, infinity, and the possibility of a different life, but also a stark reminder that life is complicated, complex, painful and sometimes intolerable but it is also what we make of it. Despite the distractions and when the game of life becomes the cruelty of life, it is up to the individual to decide on the appropriate course of action, because after all there are no rules and no winners. Just love and friendship made better through willingness and forgiveness.The focus on relationships was superb but I particularly loved the reinvention of Sadie and Sam’s relationship and the quote that says it all…“The way to turn an ex-lover into a friend is to never stop loving them, to know that when one phase of a relationship ends it can transform into something else. It is to acknowledge that love is both a constant and a variable at the same time.”I loved that “Love is both constant and variable”. True of many relationships. Overall an excellent book, there is no doubt that this book will continue to be enjoyed by many tomorrow, and tomorrow and tomorrow!!!.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '**WINNER OF GOODREADS FICTION GENRE, THIS ONE IS SPECIAL**Initially I had trouble getting through parts of this book and even put it aside for a day. Some of the details of designing, coding and playing video games were tedious for me to read.However, when I tried to get into another book – the characters of THIS BOOK kept calling me back. From 30% on I was invested and fell in love with Sadie, Sam and Marx.It’s important to note that this book covers several decades so it’s hard to describe all that happens with these characters!!Sam and Sadie meet in a hospital. Sadie is there to visit her sister, who is undergoing cancer treatment, and Sam is a patient. He was in a horrific car accident and his foot has been repaired but it will never be normal!! He will be in constant pain!!Sadie and Sam bond over their love of video games, mazes, etc.“They had the rare kind of friendship that allowed for a great deal of privacy within it.”There is a point where Sadie and Sam don’t see each other for years but when they are back together the magic is still there. Ideas are worked out together, code is written, Marx is the producer and promoter andfor a long time all is good.As with all human relationships that span decades, these three will go through many changes, and it’s wonderful to watch how they grow. All the emotions are here, friendship, love, happiness, grief, depression, exuberance – all so well described that I felt it with them!!The writing in this book is absolutely wonderful. I love this quote from Marx“What is a game? Marx said. “It’s tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. It’s the possibility of infinite rebirth, infinite redemption”.I already miss these characters so much! I would encourage you to give this novel a try, even if you’ve never played a video game in your life!!!I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through NetGalley.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'this is a story about a boy and a girl, ""often in love, but never lovers,"" who meet as children and choose to become creative partners once they become adults. that choice leads them to fantastic success--and failure, and turmoil, and heartbreak. it brings them together and forces them apart many times over many years as they navigate disability, race, class, and violence together.this book was MADE for me. and you. and your best friend. and anybody with a pulse. and everybody needs to read this partly because i\'m 300% sure the world would be better if we did, but mostly because everybody deserves to experience a masterpiece at least once in their life, and this is a masterpiece.i think this is maybe my favorite book i\'ve ever read, and i don\'t say that lightly. it\'s worth ALL of the hype. sam & sadie are infuriating, arrogant, kind, and real, and their stories will sit with me for a very long time. i think i will need to reread this about 3902 more times in order to have an opinion that i can easily put to words, but for now just know that my plan is to make everybody in my life read this book. and you. also you.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""I hate to come in and be a Debbie Downer for this book, but sometimes this happens. There is a specific kind of sentimentality or emotion that just does not work for me at all, but that a lot of people find extremely compelling. It is a matter of personal taste, it is not really about whether a book is inherently good or bad. You either like a book that will purposely tug at your heartstrings or you don't. I don't, ergo this book was not for me.The thing is, that I liked the first half of this book pretty well. I enjoyed the way we see Sam and Sadie, who became friends through playing video games as kids, and the way they come together and then break apart. I liked seeing how their grudges and resentments could trickle in to cause problems, and then it could all be erased through their joy of gaming together.About halfway through this book I started to get suspicious. I had a feeling that we were being set up for something. That the stakes were being purposely heightened. I did not like it! I kept seeing danger around every turn when that was not what kind of book this was. Until, well, I ended up being right after all. I did not like the last half at all. It felt manipulative and bordering on maudlin. It didn't feel like it really earned what it was going for. Also, slight spoiler thoughts behind a tag,Marx is just not a real person! He has no flaws, apparently, besides sleeping around in his early 20's. He is handsome and charming and loyal and apparently good at everything? I never bought his relationship with Sadie and it felt contrived just to give Sadie something to grieve. He is basically an ex machina to make everything happen in the book, it got very annoying.I do not think you need to be a gamer at all to read this book. I'm not and I was able to be invested in everything along the way. Zevin is deft at explaining what makes a game compelling without boring anyone. Ultimately this is a book about friendship that just happens to be set around video games.There were lots of little things that irked me along the way (I will be so happy if I never read another book where a character attends Harvard) particularly Dov's character, who is a pretty terrible person but that everyone decides is just fine because all that happened so long ago, right? It was pretty weird, especially since he treats the only major female character so badly. But there were also lots of little things that I enjoyed, little threads that Zevin would drop and then pick up again (secret highways, the history of Sam's mother, etc.).I just wanted to read a perfectly boring book about Sam and Sadie working together, the highs and lows of their friendship. (In a lot of ways this is similar to a bottle episode of Mythic Quest that I liked a lot, though this had the potential to be better because it was based on friendship more than romance.) But I suspect this book's target audience isn't interested in that and they are here to have their heartstrings pulled. If that is you, there is a lot here that I think you'll like. And the video game elements really serve to distinguish it from the pack.I did the audio version of this book, the reader had actually also read another book I'd read just a few days earlier. I like her style, which she does adjust to the material, but is more of a flat reading than an overly emotional one. I think it suits, balancing out some of the elements in the book. She also has to do a lot of accents, which she manages quite well.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""⭐️Goodreads Award Best Fiction⭐️My top read for 2022. A brilliant coming of age masterpiece, spanning almost 30 years. An epic tale of friendship, love, art, video games, and the journey of life.As a teen, I played my fair share of Sonic, Mario Brothers, etc, but nothing with the intensity of this book, realistic games that blur reality and fantasy. I was immersed.Gabrielle Zevin weaved a layered story, carefully crafting characters within the backdrop of gaming. She was able to peak my interest which speaks to the beauty of her writing.This is the story of Sam and Sadie, Sam and Marx, Sadie and Marx, and their journey building a successful gaming company. Sam and Sadie meet in the most unexpected places-a hospital. Sadie's sister is undergoing cancer treatment, while Sam, is recovering from a major injury that leaves him disabled. Sam and Sadie connect over their love for games. Sadie becomes an integral piece of Sam's life and his recovery.Time moves forward, Sam and Marx are roommates at Harvard. Marx is an aspiring actor while Sam pursues his passion for making games. One day, Sam happens to meet Sadie on campus (she's there for a gaming meeting) and they connect (over Oregon Trail of all things). Sadie gives Sam a game she's working on, and the rest is gaming history--a story of creating amazing, creative games together.Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow (an ode to MacBeth, which later, ties beautifully into one of the characters arcs) is the story of missed opportunities, successes, pains, love, and a passion for art.There is a time for any fledgling artist where one’s taste exceeds one’s abilities. The only way to get through this period is to make things anywayZevin not only created amazing virtual worlds I'd love to play, she wrote an entire chapter within a game--literal genius. There was also a chapter in second person, which may feel out of place to some, but made sense in the context of the character's journey.Initially, I was bogged down by all the gaming conversations, but it's worth it to continue reading. The beginning ties in wonderfully as we learn the struggles of creating true art. Zevin also touches upon some important cultural/political topics that helped move the story along.The truth is, I cried and cheered for these wonderfully written characters, like friends more than fictional souls.I recently read, 'The Storied Life of A.J. Fikery,' and became an instant fan of Zevin. It feels remarkably coincidental that her new book came right after--alas, the stars aligned.I savored Tomorrow, Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, felt protective of the words, and had a sense of reverence to the story. Have you ever felt a physical reaction after finishing a book? I was in a melancholy state, wanting to be transported into the pages, stilling time.How could a person still be as young as he objectively knew himself to be and have had so much time pass?As I closed the last page, my daughter wanted to be tucked into bed, yet I wanted to sit with the book and fall asleep- savoring the story. It was hard to let go, say goodbye. The characters came to life in a way that felt tangible.There was the life that you lived, which consisted of the choices you made. And then, there was the other life, the one that was the things you hadn’t chosen. And sometimes, this other life felt as palpable as the one you were living.^^This quote moved my soul.5 spectacular stars!""}]"

The Secret History
",Donna Tartt,4.17,848433,3584,"Fiction, Mystery, Classics, Contemporary, Thriller, Literary Fiction, Mystery Thriller",559,16-09-1992,"Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries. But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality they slip gradually from obsession to corruption and betrayal, and at last—inexorably—into evil.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'My original review of this wasn\'t much of anything, because I believed (and still kind of do) that everything worth saying about this book has been said.However, there are things that I believe no one should say emerging in real time, and so contributing my likely already-expressed thoughts might counterbalance them, to some degree.In my first foray at writing about this (which you can still see below), I focused on the immersion of it. I said I ""loved"" its characters, though of course I meant more that I loved them as figures, considering they are unlikable murderers. I wrote about it vaguely and glowingly, thinking everyone had sort of...gotten the point of the book, already.But then I readthis reviewin Gawker, so I\'m coming back.The Secret History follows mainly our narrator, Richard, as he looks back on his time in the classics program of a liberal arts college. Richard is unhappy, impressionable, desperate. His values are more ideas than ideals - vague and dim reflections of what love, and beauty, and wisdom, concepts he\'s never known, might feel or look like, rather than what they are.He arrives at his preppy and prestigious(ish) New England college to slowly become obsessed and then part of the mysterious and selective classics program, a cultlike group of trust fund babies led by an often-overstepping and charismatic professor.Coming from a poor and abusive background, where beauty is nowhere to be found, Richard wants nothing more than to immerse and lose himself in this group of wealthy and charming students. He wants to befriend them, to sleep with them, to live with them, to do everything he can tobecomethem.Including, as they indulge in ever-spiraling hedonism, murder.And it never works.When our story ends, our group is decimated, some members dead, some irrevocably changed, all unwilling to return to the story of that fateful year - all except Richard, who is unable to leave it behind.When I hear this, I don\'t believe that the point of the story, or what Tartt is trying to tell us, is that a love of beauty is equivalent to an amoral life. I don\'t think she condemns an appreciation for the aesthetic, or even a classical scholarship.I don\'t think you\'re supposed to like these characters, or even think they\'re very realistic - they are, after all, portraits in hindsight written by someone in the throes of unrequited obsession.I don\'t think you\'re supposed to relate to them, or to see their story as something that might happen to you if you read too much Greek myth or like pretty things too much.To quote the article that inspired the fit of rage that has me typing away, I don\'t think this is ""about all the things [its writer] loved,"" while ""miss[ing] the point of them entirely."" At the age of seventeen, they continue, they ""wanted (I thought) exactly what its youthful characters wanted: a poetic life, a mythic life, a life shot through with meaning. I loved (I thought) exactly what its characters loved: nostalgic emblems of an era imagined as significant.""To that I say: huh?As I grow older, I care less for lovely or perfect or nice or even good (in the moral definition of the word) characters, and find myself only wanting to read about the unlikable, the complex, the ones who have something to say on what I shouldn\'t do, rather than teach me about what I should.It was clear to me that The Secret History is not the latter example, but the former.Our merry band of classics fetishists may think they are living a life of poetry and meaning, but we, the readers, know they aren\'t. We know that life\'s beauty lies not in pleasure without regard for others, in the fulfillment of selfish desires, but in case we get confused, Donna Tartt shows us that a life lived by those guidelines leads to irrevocably damaged relationships, unfading pain, and death.The Secret History is not a nihilistic book because its characters\' behaviors result in no meaning. Quite the opposite - it is a book about what makes life meaningful by showing us what meaning is not.The Gawker piece quotes a Tartt essay in which she writes, “\'Something in the spirit longs for meaning — longs to believe in a world order where nothing is purposeless, where character is more than chemistry, and people are something more than a random chaos of molecules,\'” and in this vein concludes, ""To take Tartt the essayist seriously is to wager on that meaning. Even if that means leaving Hampden behind.""And I would agree. To find meaning, one must leave Hampden behind - for it was never intended that what happened there should be lived by as example.(I also think there\'s something very interesting in the class dynamics here. But I\'ll save that for the next time I get mad enough to write almost 1,000 words.)Bottom line: Book so nice I reviewed it twice.------------book club updatethis is the july pick for thebeautiful world book club!!elleand i will be vibing amidst the dark academia and the gluttony and the classics. please join us!!------------original reviewHere is the problem with reviewing every book I read: Sometimes I throw around terms before I really need them, and then once I read THE book, The Story that requires and deserves that descriptor, I have nothing to give it.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...Right now I have this problem. Because I have used the word “immersive” before, and immediately upon my completion of this book it became clear that I should have saved it for right now.I felt like I lived inside these pages. I felt like I began to think in the beautiful and sharp prose that fills them. I felt like I knew the characters, ate decadent lunches and walked the snowy campus and whispered with them. I felt an aching emptiness, a genuine longing, when I read the final words.I miss living here.This was very, very slow - to the point that about halfway through I said (inexplicably, aloud), “I don’t know what they’ll even do for the rest of the book” - and yet I was gripped by it.It’s genuinely masterful.I love Richard and I LOVE Camilla and I love Francis and I, fine, okay, at least like Charles and Henry and even Bunny and Julian.And I miss them all.This is an incredible work, but maybe the most incredible thing is how the readerisRichard. I, too, miss my bygone days at my prestigious New England college with my whip-smart group of eccentric friends, and, like him, I am too quickly forced to realize the fallacy of such a feeling.After all, it was all a fiction.Bottom line: I’m raising this to a five star rating.------------pre-reviewyou\'ll have to excuse me, i\'d love to actually write something here but my brain is broken and i am incapable of thought.also seems absurd to try to use words when donna tartt took all the good ones.review to come / 4.5 stars------------currently-reading updatesme: *is slightly behind on my reading challenge*also me: *starts a 600-page book*'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""“Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it.”I have never read anything like this book in my entire life. I laid in bed for over an hour last night upon finishing this book, just tossing and turning and thinking about everything I just consumed. I still don’t think I can put my feelings into words, but I can honestly say this book was a cathartic experience for me, and the irony of the word “catharsis” being a Greek rooted word is not lost on me, because if this book is anything it’s a modern day Greek tragedy.The Secret Historyis told in a unique style, which is a man reminiscing on some significant events that took place in his college life a bit over a year ago. So, we follow a younger version of Richard, who is finally starting his life away from his abusive and poor family in California. He gets accepted into an elite college in Vermont, and moves across the county in hopes of a fresh start.Upon arriving to the college, Richard is denied entry into an Ancient Greek course, because the professor that teaches it only allows enrollment to his small, handpicked, group of students that seem almost cult-like. Needless to say, Richard becomes utterly obsessed with the five students in this group and the professor, Julian Morrow, himself. And with a turn of good luck, and by solving a Greek problem, Richard is accepted into this exclusive group.Yet, in the prologue we find out that Richard, and four others from the group, murdered one of the other students who they are supposed to have a very close friendship with.The Secret Historyis then told in two parts, one being the events that took place leading up to the death of their fellow classmate, and then one part being all the events that take place after he is murdered.Bunnyis the poor soul that is unfortunately murdered by his peers, yet he’s a racist bigot and you’ll be kind of happy he’s dead, for the most part.Richard, as stated in all the paragraphs above, is the narrator looking back on the events that took place.Henryis my personal favorite, but perhaps the worst of the bunch. Or maybe the best, I’m not really sure, but that’s truly the beauty of this story. Twins,CharlesandCamilla. Charles is a bad alcoholic and drug user, and Camilla steals most people’s heart and/or affection. And lastly, we haveFrancis, who owns a country home that is the stage for many events that take place in this book. Oh, and everyone but Richard has money, even though Richard tries his damnedest to keep that a secret.“What we did was terrible, but still I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry’s, too much Greek prose composition – whatever you like.”All the characters are morally grey to just generally horrible people, but you completely ignore it because Donna Tartt weaves this hypnotic spell with her writing, that you feel like you are reading this book in a dream like lull.The Secret Historyis unlike anything I’ve ever read before, and I’m not sure I’ll ever read anything quite like it again.I also want to touch upon sexuality in this book, because a lot of the members in this group are not straight in the slightest. Like, maybe the only ones that were completely straight were Bunny and Camilla. I’m not saying that the queerness in this book is vilified, but it’s for sure not shown in the best of lights. So please use caution while going into this.And this book is so very heavy in general, so please use caution while reading.Content/Trigger warningsfor slut shaming, use of the R word, homophobia, hate speech, fatphobic comments, racist comments, animal cruelty, sexual assault, incest, performing rituals, suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, and murder.I know this review is probably not one of my best, and I know I’m being super vague about all these big themes, but this book is just on a whole other level. Maybe this book is about five new adults dealing with the consequences of murder in a very human and realistic way. Maybe it’s about how we are all just trying to fit in and find family, by whatever unhealthy means available and/or possible. Maybe this book is about birth and death and how important the time between those two points truly is. But I do believe with my whole heart that this book would best be experienced blind, and to just go in and feel all the feelings that Donna Tartt will serve you.While finishing the book, me andPalomahad a discussion about the ending and how Greek heroes’ tales normally go. We talked about how murder taints everything, and how blood is the only thing that can purify it. We talked about how wearing masks is so important, yet death is another mask that we will all eventually wear. God, I’m being so cryptic, but if you’ve read the book maybe this paragraph will mean something to you, because it means the world to me.Overall, I know I sound like a broken record, but this was one of the most unique reading experiences of my life. I honest to God just do not have the words to put in this review how this book made me feel. I will say that it very much feels like a spell is being cast upon you while reading. Like, I am almost positive that Donna Tartt cannot be a human being, because she is such an exclusive enigma. Also, I think I’ve developed a huge crush on her, so there’s that at least. I can say very confidently that I will remember this book, and the feelings it gave me while reading, for the rest of my life.“Beauty is rarely soft or consolatory. Quite the contrary. Genuine beauty is always quite alarming.”Blog|Twitter|Tumblr|Instagram|Youtube|TwitchBuddy read withPaloma! ❤""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Thank god it\'s over. I don\'t think I can surpassthe review Nick wrote earlier tonight, but here goes . . .The good:--This book is well-written, at least in a certain contextless sense. There are many sentences in it (occasionally, even paragraphs) that, if taken by themselves, look like they might have been from a book worth reading.--At least two of the central characters (I\'m thinking of Bunny and Henry) are vividly portrayed and interesting figures. (Unfortunately, one of them dies halfway through -- that\'s not a spoiler, as it\'s revealed in the prologue -- and the other largely fades from view in the second half.)--There\'s at least a 200-page stretch in which the book is an exciting page-turner. (Unfortunately, it\'s over 500 pages long.)The bad:--Besides the two characters mentioned above, the others are frustratingly thin. Francis has no personality traits besides being stereotypically gay; Camilla has no personality traits besides being a generic female love interest (in a completely unappealing subplot that seems to have been included on the Hollywood logic that no story is complete without the protagonist falling in love) and thus having a putatively alluring reticence and mystique; I\'m not sure Charles has any discernible personality traits at all. These three characters are rarely absent -- at least one of them appears in virtually every scene -- and given that it\'s almost impressive how poorly developed they are. Other characters suffer for the opposite reason -- for instance, Julian, the charismatic professor who teaches Greek to the central characters, exerts a supposedly profound influence on their worldviews but barely seems to exist in the story itself.--The story\'s climax occurs around halfway through, and the remaining ~250 pages are devoted to an absurdly long series of tacky soap opera plotlines that appear and then disappear every 20 pages. The subject matter of these storylines -- incest, drunk driving, stealing drugs from someone\'s grandmother (!), smoking pot and worrying that someone\'s mom is going to find out (!!) -- feel so strainingly lurid and/or stereotypically teenage, and so irrelevant to the themes of the first half, that it often felt like some moral tract about Bad Teens Doing Drugs had been spliced onto the end of a totally different book.--The biggest flaw, which was what really ruined the book for me: the style of the narration does not fit the subject matter. This is a book about a group of wealthy and pompous but otherwise ordinary college students committing murder in cold blood. Surely someone looking back on such an act would be plunged into a bunch of somewhat abstract reflections on how they came to do they things they did, what led them to get involved with their co-conspirators, what this all means about them as a person and a moral actor, etc. But that isn\'t the kind of book Tartt wants to write. She wants to write in a contemporary litfic / creative writing style in which abstract ideas about human behavior are conveyed only implicitly, through character behaviors and well-chosen details — “show, don’t tell.”So you get all these overly mannered descriptions of the narrator noticing some shoes lying on the ground and talking about how the shoes made him feel and so forth, and you just want to say, “okay, but Richard, what does it all mean? I know you must have some big abstract thoughts about what it all means — how could you not? — and I don’t know why won’t you just tell me about them instead of telling me about how the campus looked in spring.” There are narrators for whom this kind of bland immediacy reads as characterization, but in this case it really felt like Tartt was just snapping together two incompatible building blocks -- like she sat down one day and said “I am going to write a ‘literary novel’ and it will be about ‘ordinary people committing murder’ ” and the result was this strange incongruous thing. The book feels so much like a reductio ad absurdum of the conventions of mainstream literary fiction -- the gently controlled narrative voice, the ""deftly chosen"" sensory detail, the distaste for essayistic digressions -- that at times I started to wonder if I was reading a parody of the genre.There are occasional attempts to provide a moral or conceptual gloss on the whole thing, as when, in the very first paragraph, the narrator declares that his ""tragic flaw"" is ""a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs."" But ideas like this aren\'t borne out by the narrative itself -- we never get a sense of what the narrator means by ""the picturesque,"" and his bland, passive behavior doesn\'t seem to be characterized by a ""morbid longing"" for anything. Which brings me to my final point . . .--Lots of wasted potential. Some of the subject matter here is really interesting: say, the idea of people who try to apply an ancient Greek mindset to the modern world, or the question of how a group of initially innocuous people could be led inexorably by circumstance to kill one of their friends. But the whole thing is just so under-analyzed, so unclear about what its ideas are even as it desperately wants to be a book about big, profound ideas. References to the difference between ancient and modern mindsets, or to various interpretations of the murder, are occasionally tossed out but never grow roots; they drown in the ocean of pointless plot. An interesting idea will crop up every 50 pages of so, and Tartt will smother it in its cradle and then write 50 more pages of binge drinking and soap opera convolutions as if in penance. It\'s telling that Julian, the Greek professor, shows up so rarely, because the book clearly wants to be about his worldview and the effect it had on his students, and if he\'d actually made more than a few appearances Tartt might have had to clear up exactly what his worldviewwasand present some clear, arguable ideas about what it did to these students. What would her creative writing professors make of that? Show, don\'t tell!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""The first paragraph ofThe Secret Historyroughly sums up the mood of the book. In it, the narrator, Richard Papen, says that he thinks his fatal flaw is 'a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs'. If you can relate to these words, chances are you'll loveThe Secret History. If not, you'll probably wonder what the fuss is all about. Personally, I can totally relate to these words, so I love the book. I've read it over half a dozen times, and while I do think it has its problems, I never fail to find it utterly gripping.The Secret Historyis both an intellectual novel of ideas and a murder mystery without the whodunnit element. The reader learns right on the first page that Richard and his friends have killed one among their midst. The rest of the book goes on to explain how they came to their gruesome deed and what happened to them afterwards. Against all odds, it makes for compelling reading, despite the fact that you know right from the start who the killers are. Such is the power of Tartt's writing that you find yourself turning page after page, waiting for answers, justifications and possibly a sign of remorse. Once these have been dealt with, the book loses a bit of its power, but until that time, it's near perfect.Donna Tartt's great gift as a writer is her magnificent talent for description. Her evocation of life at a small private university in New England with its oddball mix of ivory-tower intellectuals and ditzy cokeheads is rich in detail, both shocking and funny. If it's not entirely realistic, she makes it so. Likewise, her skill at characterisation is superb. While Richard is not entirely convincing as a male narrator (a fact I find more noticeable every time I re-read the book), he and his friends make up a fascinating cast of characters: six aloof, self-absorbed and arrogant intellectuals who are obsessed with ancient Greece and don't particularly care for modern life. They're snobs and they have major issues, but somehow that only makes them more alluring. Together, they form the ultimate inner circle, the kind of tight-knit group you know should always stay together. Which makes it almost understandable that they should be willing to kill anyone who might jeopardise that group dynamic, incomprehensible though this may seem to the average reader.I can think of many reasons whyThe Secret Historystrikes such a chord with me. For one thing, I have a thing for timeless and ethereal stories, and this is one of those. Somehow the book has a dreamlike, almost hypnotic quality, despite it being very firmly set in the rather unromantic 1980s. I love that. For another thing, I have always been drawn to the unabashedly intellectual, and this book has that in spades. It makes geekdom alluring, and I just love Tartt for that. I wish I were as geeky as Henry!Ultimately, what I think I respond to most inThe Secret Historyis the friendship aspect.The Secret Historyis very much a book about friendship. It's about the very human yearning to belong and be accepted by people we admire. It's about the sacrifices we make to keep friendships intact, the insecurity we feel when we think we might not be completely accepted by our friends after all, and the paranoia we experience when it seems our friends may have betrayed us. About the feeling of invincibility we get from having great friends, and the melancholy and loneliness that follow the disintegration of a once-great friendship. The book basically reads like an elegy on a great friendship, and one doesn't necessarily have to share Richard's intellectual attitude towards life, his morality or even his morbid longing for the picturesque to be able to relate to that. It's enough to have yearned for close friendship and been insecure in friendship. And let's face it, who hasn't?I do not thinkThe Secret Historyis a perfect book. As I said, I find Richard somewhat unconvincing as a male character; there is too much about him that screams 'female author' to me. Furthermore, the ending is decidedly weak, although to be fair, I have no idea how else Tartt could have finished her book. The story does seem to be inexorably heading in that particular direction. Insofar as the ending reflects the disintegration that is going on in the characters' lives, it could probably be said to be appropriate. Still, I wish Tartt could have come up with something on a par with the rest of the book. If she had, this would have been a six-star book. I don't know many of those.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'DNF at 70%“If you love one book by a certain author it does not automatically mean you will enjoy all the author’s work” (Me, while reading The Secret History).Before I begin my review I have to inform you that Goldfinch is one of my favorite novels. If you want, you can see my short reviewhere. Based on that fact, there should be no doubt in anyone’s mind of how much I love Donna Tartt’s writing. I thought it was perfect in the first novel I read by her, it kept me coming back for more each day, even though the plot was not overly exciting all the time. Although many reviewers are of the opinion that Goldfinch was too long I thought that it could have had 1000 pages and I would have still savored all of them.The Secret History is a different story entirely. I will admit from the beginning that I did not find the subject too enticing when I read the blurb but, nevertheless, I was looking forward to dive into the novel because it was written by the wonderful Donna Tartt. The beautiful writing is still there, that is one of the few reasons that I made it this far. However, I have a few (read many) problems with the content and I will do my best to explain them below.Firstly, we have the insufferable, snobbish, self-absorbed characters. I am not the kind a reader that needs to like the characters but I want them to be interesting and vivid. The six students felt the same to me, even the main character did not possess any special trait. Maybe Bunny was the only one that gave me strong feelings; it almost brought me to the point where I thought it would be a good idea to be killed. The point is, I enjoy well done villains with interior conflicts but there were none to be found here.Secondly, there is the discrepancy between what I understood the book to be about and what it really was. The blurb states that.“Under the influence of their charismatic classics professor, a group of clever, eccentric misfits at an elite New England college discover a way of thinking and living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries"". Let’s begin with the first line,.“under the influence of their charismatic classic professor”. In all the 400 pages that I read I did not see the classic professor as a charismatic character. Actually, the professor was almost non-existent. We are sometimes told about him but when he actually appears in the picture he only has a few flat lines. Oh, and he smiles a lot. I was expecting the teacher and the intellectual conversation between him and the students to have an important presence in the novel, to challenge my thinking, but I was out of luck. I believe we are presented only one discussion from the class, which was essential for the plot, although I did not feel its importance when I read it. We are told about how great and eccentric this professor is but we never actually see it. I was expecting him to be some sort of a disguised devil if he manages to influence his students to commit murder but I do not see how their acts had anything to do with the professor. If anything, he was worried about them when they disappeared for a while and lost contact with them.Going forward, to.“a group of clever, eccentric misfits”. Same problem here, we are told and not showed how smart they were. A.“living that is a world away from the humdrum existence of their contemporaries”. basically means expensive restaurants, a mansion in the countryside and vacation in a palace in Rome. I guess it is a typical existence for people with money, not necessarily something out of ordinary that should deserve our awe.Their first act of “evil” felt underclimatic since, again, we are told about it, we do not actually experience it. It would have been a totally different experience to be there when it happened not to be told by it from a character after a month or so after the deed was done.Finally, I thought there was too much flat, useless dialogue. I wish I had an example to show but I always forget to take notes, sorry.I feel so disappointed for not liking this one but I am not losing my faith in Donna Tartt. I am sure her next book will amaze me once again.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'This novel, like so many other first novels, is full of everything that the author wants to show off about herself. Like a freshman who annoys everyone with her overbearing sense of importance and unfathomable potential, Donna Tartt wrote this book as though the world couldn\'t wait to read about all of the bottled-up personal beliefs, literary references, and colorfully apt metaphors that she had been storing up since the age of 17.The most fundamentally unlikable thing about this book is that all of the characters -- each and every one of them -- are snobby, greedy, amoral, pretentious, melodramatic, and selfish. The six main characters are all students at a small and apparently somewhat undemanding college in Vermont, studying ancient Greek with a professor who\'s so stereotypically gay as to be a homosexual version of a black-face pantomime. In between bouts of translating Greek, the students end up murdering two people, and then devolve into incoherent, drunken, boring decay.The best thing I can equate this book to is the experience of listening to someone else\'s dream or listening to a very drunk friend ramble on and on and on, revealing a little too much awkward personal information in the process. The climax ofThe Secret History\'s narrative was around page 200, but the book was 500 pages long. So, essentially, this book contained 300 pages of scenes where the characters do nothing but drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, go to the hospital for drinking so much alcohol and smoking so many cigarettes, get pulled over for drunk driving, talk about alcohol and cigarettes, do cocaine, and gossip about each other (while drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes).Tartt\'s writing was sometimes genuinely good at establishing a thrilling and suspenseful mood, but other times, especially toward the end, her writing became the kind of self-conscious, contrived, empty prose that I can imagine someone writing just to fill out a page until a good idea comes to them, kind of like how joggers will jog in place while waiting for a traffic light. That kind of writing practice is fine...as long as the editor is smart enough to cut it before the final copy. The last 300 pages were the authorial equivalent of that kind of jogging while going nowhere, and it soured the whole book for me.In the book\'s attempt to comment on the privilege, self-interest, and academic snobbery of rich college kids in New England, the book itself comes to be just as self-absorbed and obsessive as its characters -- it turns into a constant litany of unnecessary conversations, sexual tensions that go nowhere, purple prose descriptions of the landscape, contrived plot twists that fizzle out, and forced, overblown metaphors.The confusing part was that Tartt seemed to identify with (and expect us to identify with) these students -- not to admire them for murdering people, obviously, but to respect and envy their precious contempt for everything modern and popular, as though they lived on a higher plane than normal people. The cliche of academic types being remote from the mundane world and out of touch with reality may have a grain of truth to it, but Tartt took that cliche way too far. The story is set in the early 90s, and yet some of the characters had never heard of ATMs, and they still wrote with fountain pens, drove stick shift cars, cultivated roses in their backyards, wore suits and ties to class, and said things like, ""I say, old man!"" Did I mention that this story is set in the early 90s? It got to the point where all the anachronisms came to seem ridiculous and gratuitous.Ostensibly, the point of the novel was to critique the point of view that privileged academics are somehow superior to the average person, but Tartt seemed too enamored of her own characters and the endearing way they held cigarettes between their fingers to really allow that kind of critique to be successful. Maybe Tartt\'s second novel managed to get away from the claustrophobic selfishness ofThe Secret History, but I don\'t feel up to reading it after this.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Five Things About The Secret History.This is going to be a difficult book for me to talk about. I finished it days ago but I find myself a littleverklempt, I’ll admit. It’s been a long time since a book has stuck with me so completely as this one, and I say that having had a quite remarkable year for memorable reading. So, the summary is straightforward and completely unhelpful: a Californian boy arrives at a private New England college where he falls in with a bunch of snooty but delightful Classics majors who happen to have accidentally killed someone during a Bacchian rite they just happened to be conducting in their spare time. That is a totally truthful depiction of some of the events in the book, but it is not what the book is ABOUT. I will do my best to convince you to pick it up in other ways. Without further ado, here are five things about THE SECRET HISTORY.1. This is not a new book. All of your friends have already read it. You probably already have a copy of it, actually, that you picked up at some point in the last decade, and now it molders in a box in your master bedroom closet, the one that you never unpacked last time you moved. Right next to your college alarm clock and two boxes of 9-volt batteries and that shirt you can’t throw out because it was a gift. The reason why I’m pointing out that it’s not a new book is because, since reading it, I’ve been told by several people that it is their Favorite Book Ever. It is one thing for you to read a book six months before and maintain it as a Favorite Book. It is something more remarkable when a book can elicit a passionate response from readers twenty years after its publication.2. This book is full of terrible people. Pretty much the lot of the people that our narrator Richard meets are awful in some way. Self-centered or elitist or potheads or sociopathic or just people with really loud voices in quiet places. Even Richard is not exactly a great guy. But the magic of this novel is that, somehow, you find these terrible people deeply sympathetic. I need to go back and reread it to understand this strange enchantment. How do I find them so charming? Why do I want them to like Richard? GIVE ME YOUR SECRETS, BOOK.3. This is not a whodunit. You are told pretty much the Bad Thing That Happens in the prologue, and you can see it coming like a comet for much of the book. The effect of this, however, is to create a lovely, unbearable tension and anticipation. And when the moment comes — in a line that involves ferns — it is so deliciously awful. I actually exhaled gloriously and put the book down for a moment because I was so delighted by the actual pay off.4. It’s long. It’s over 200,000 words long, I think, and 600 pages in my edition. It took me five days to read it. And it’s not just long, it’s dense. One of the blurbs on the inside of the jacket said that it read like a 19th century novel, and I don’t think that’s at all unearned. It takes its time developing atmosphere and character quirks and some of the days in the novel take dozens of pages to unfold. It is not a novel to speed through. It’s a novel to get stuck in. I put it down when I got too tired, when I felt like I was starting to skim.5. WHAT ELSE CAN I SAY? I adore the characters so much. I adore the hint —the breath — of the supernatural. I adore the slow, building tension and the sense that I, as a reader, was being skillfully manipulated. Yes, that. That last one. I think that is what I love the most about this novel. I get the idea that Donna Tartt was completely in control of this novel. Everything is measured and deliberate and just perfectly done, and I trust her entirely. Fifty pages in, I knew that she was going to tell me a story I was going to enjoy, even if I had no idea what it was going to be.Man, I just am going to flail about some more.

I don't even know where to begin, but let's try.I've seena lotof hype for The Secret History everywhere. So, why not give it a try? Plus, it seems cool and the aesthetic is interesting.The first 100 pages, I must admit, were boring. It was really hard for me to get through. I blame uni and the fact that nothing interesting was going on at the moment. The fact that the climax happened around the page 200 or so and then nothing happened pissed me off. And then... That was it. Nothing. Zero. Nada, maldita sea.The only characters that I really liked died, they were Henry... and Bunny. Yes. The annoying bitch who couldn't keep his mouth shut and the only one whoreally reactedto a murder. Yeah, I agree that he was annoying and was a complete asshole, but was one of the only two who really had personality.The writing was mid... Until it wasn't anymore. The last 150 pages were like Tartt was writing just for the sake of it.

And the consecuences of it: ending up in the hospital or thinking they were going to die. I wishIhad been drunk while reading this.I know I shouldn't have, but I laughed way too hard when Henry killed himself. It was so random and so funny. He tried to play the hero card and for what? Honestly, his death wasn't something memorable for me. I mean, yeah, he wasn't pretty bad and I was laughing my ass off when Richard realized that Henry had only told him what he wanted to and not the entire truth, like, how can you besoidiot, Richard? I still can't believe that Donna Tartt decided to put Richard as the mc, or even imagined him at all...This mf was boring as hell.For some reason, her characters are bland, have no personality and are really annoying. Yes, even more than that bitch of Bunny.Anyways, I'm not sorry for rating this book with 0.5 stars. If I could, I would give it 0 stars.

Or, ‘wow it seems exactly like the type of book you’d adore.’ And they’re right, it is exactly the type of book I’d adore. So why can I not bring myself around to loving it?The Secret Historyis very much a tale of two novels, the split between them coming when Bunny dies. And that isn’t a spoiler, we’re told in the first line that Bunny dies. The first book being the lead up and the second book being the aftermath, with the group just trying to deal with the fact that they actually killed Bunny. Once again, not a spoiler, we’re told on the firstpagethat the group kill Bunny. And if you don’t like even the first pages of novels being spoiled then I suggest you should go outside more often.Side note:it’s rather depressing to read this novel when you’re the same age as the characters. I felt so under-read. But then I remembered they’re all fictional, so fuck them.The first book is actually quite good. It’s all wonderfully tense as the reader is just waiting for the murder to happen. The inverted murder mystery, which oftentimes does not work, works fantastically here and you wouldn’t be talked over if you referred toThe Secret Historyas perhaps the best example of the whydunit genre.Then my biggest problem with the novel happens: the entire second half. What a fucking slog. Like, jesus. Okay Donna just because you’re writing about a funeral doesn’t mean that the novel itself has to become funereal. The whole book just becomes ‘oh aren’t we really sad!’ and ‘ugh it’s tough being murderers!’ And I think, tell me if I’m wrong here, I think Tartt expects us tosympathisewith these fucking monsters. I mean, I’ve sympathised with murderers before. I think Aileen Wuornos had a fairly sound motive. The Unabombermade some good points. But this ragtag group of Enid Blyton rejects? Nah. Not a chance.So what do I think ofThe Secret Historythe second time around? Much the same as the first time really. I did enjoy some parts more, especially the first half. I’ll be kind, I’ll bump my star rating up one. Congrats Donna, I now think your first novel is perfectly average!

Within this microcosm, they are creating their own norms and in time, their own morality, which leads to a descent to evil.A masterclass in scene setting and character development from a first person narrator's perspective; in beautifully paced suspense building; and in creating an atmosphere and plot that aptly illustrates the general complexity and confusion of relationships.

Sometimes they have messed up shit in them, BUT they leave me dumbfounded and in awe. Days after I find myself doing something completely mundane and unable to stop thinking about the story and the characters.That's whatThe Secret Historydid to me.I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.The Secret Historyfollows Richard Papen as he transfers from California to Hampden College in New England. He joins a small elite group who study Greek and are obsessed with the classics—taught by an eccentric and mysterious professor who teaches them a different way of thinking.“Everything was going beautifully, on the brink of taking wing, and I had a feeling that I'd never had, that reality itself was transforming around us in some beautiful and dangerous fashion, that we were being driven by a force we didn't understand, towards an end I did not know.”Richard recounts the events that lead up to the murder of one of his classmates and all that happens after.Never, never once in any immediate sense, did it occur to me that any of this was anything but a game. An air of unreality suffused even the most workaday details, as if we were plotting not the death of a friend but the itinerary of a fabulous trip that I, for one, never quite believed we'd ever really take.My thoughts:When I saw that my copy was over 600 pages (super thin and flimsy might I add, I almost tore them by mistake like a dozen times) I was a tiny bit daunted. The only genre in which I'm used to reading such big books is fantasy. But I quickly fell in love with the writing which was both beautiful and lyrical and was, despite my initial assumptions, actually quite accessible.This book was told in the first person but in past tense. It reminded me a lot of The Great Gatsby and the way that book was narrated.The plot was slow, full of rich detail and atmospheric.A lot of parts (especially in the beginning now that I think on it) were not relevant or necessary to the story but I think I loved it morebecauseof the attention to detail and the way Richard talks about comepletey normal, every day things he did.The setting and characters were so well fleshed out, it allowed me to connect to the story despite how problematic the characters were.In a certain sense, this was why I felt so close to the others in the Greek class. They, too, knew this beautiful and harrowing landscape, centuries dead; they'd had the same experience of looking up from their books with fifth-century eyes and finding the world disconcertingly sluggish and alien, as if it were not their home.I'm not going to lie— all the characters were terrible people. But I couldn't help sympathising with them at times.From the first page we are told about the murder this group of friends commit. This is not a happy story, it is a story about murder and the consequences that they have to face, a stain on their souls they have to bear.But while I have never considered myself a very good person, neither can I bring myself to believe that I am a spectacularly bad one. Perhaps it's simply impossible to think of oneself in such a way, our Texan friend being a case in point. What we did was terrible, but still I don't think any of us were bad, exactly; chalk it up to weakness on my part, hubris on Henry's, too much Greek prose composition – whatever you like.There were times I felt sad and empathised with them and other times I felt utterly disgusted. Donna Tartt does not shy away from harsh truths.This book is filled with jaw dropping plot twists and situations that had me crying, and gasping out loud.I read this book in autumn, sometimes under a tree with a gentle breeze in the fall sunlight and sometimes snuggled in bed with copious cups of coffee to keep me reading through the night.I 10/10 recommend reading it this way. It is not a book for devouring in one sitting, but rather a book slowly savoured.I know this review is probably inadequate and does not fully capture my thoughts, but it is the best I can do right now.One likes to think there's something in it, that old platitude amor vincit omnia. But if I've learned one thing in my short sad life, it is that that particular platitude is a lie. Love doesn't conquer everything. And whoever thinks it does is a fool.Buddy read with my favTürkan✨__Initial reaction:And as I'm sitting on my wingbacked chair, I take a sip of my (now cold) black coffee. I turn the last page. I am a tumult of emotions. To name a few: shock, sadness, and awe....Okay I lie. I don't drinkblackcoffee. What the hell is that devil juiceWow. That was really good.

But Beauty—unless she is wed to something more meaningful—is always superficial.” this is EXACTLY how i feel. the writing is undeniably gorgeous, the aesthetic is perfect, but it’s just that—aesthetic. richard is an unreliable narrator, sure, but not because he’s morally-grey or any other particularly interesting reason. he’s just sort of an idiot. i usually enjoy the bystander-as-narrator trope, but this was a whole new level of obliviousness. he spends pages rambling pretentiously about the most trivial things while the other characters plot very obviously in front of him and he sees absolutely Nothing.speaking of the other characters: one-dimensional and static. all of them. i prefer flawed, morally-grey characters because they’re interesting. henry, charles, and francis are not interesting. they’re just bad people doing bad things, most often to each other. they’re essentially carbon copies of each other, archetypes with no true personality aside from one or two defining traits. bunny is unbearable, and julian is comically under-utilized. he’s supposed to be this overarching influence on the characters, but he doesn’t!! do!! anything!!don’t even get me started on camilla. she’s used as a plot device for henry’s motivation and charles’ downfall and richard’s under-developed fixation. she has no personality aside from being androgynously beautiful and ~not like other girls.yes, the characters are supposed to be unlikable. i am aware of that. we’re supposed to see the events after bunny’s death as richard unveiling the truth, finally seeing past his initial intoxication with this charming, strange group of people into their cold, dead insides. but there was never truly any veil. everything is blatantly clear from the start, and i knew exactly where everything was going to go. this is not a particularly complex book, though people tend to herald it as such. the plot, character motivations, and structure are extremely straight forward.i don’t even buy the argument that the final 300 (300!!) pages are to showcase the remaining characters’ descent into guilt/madness as a consequence of their actions. none of them actually change. it’s stated very clearly that charles has always been an abusive shithole, francis has always been a nervous wreck, camilla has always been a little withdrawn, henry has always been... the way he is. there’s no “descent.” it’s simply a plateau that richard feels the need to narrate in the most mind-numbingly dull way possible.i understand everything this book was trying to do, i just don’t think it accomplished any of them.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""Does such a thing as ‘the fatal flaw,’ that showy dark crack running down the middle of a life, exist outside literature? I used to think it didn’t. Now I think it does. And I think that mine is this: a morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.""Hot damn this book was brilliant! I’m officially joining the ranks of Donna Tartt fans. Three things happened after I finished this book: 1) I wanted to start all over again 2) I had difficulty reading the books I chose next (even though they are excellent in their own right) 3) I couldn’t figure out how the hell to write this review! I’ve actually been afraid to read Tartt. I mean, what if I didn’t love her like everyone else? How was I going to explain that?! And now I can’t seem to coherently express why I admired her writing so much in this book.I’ll start perhaps with that quote above and that""morbid longing for the picturesque at all costs.""I can totally relate to that. Perhaps not""at all costs"", however. Richard, a middle-class Californian and the narrator ofThe Secret History, thirsts for the intellectual and glamorous life. More importantly, he’s searching for a place to belong; he yearns for what he believes to be ‘his people.’ Sounds familiar, right? And perhaps a bit clichéd? Well, there’s certainly nothing ordinary about this story. It’s intelligently crafted, and the reader is drawn right into the book alongside Richard. I can’t say I liked Richard, but for 500+ pages, I lived outside of my little world and smack dab in the middle of Richard’s. The setting is perfect and beautifully described – a small liberal arts college in rural Vermont.""Even now I remember those pictures, like pictures in a storybook one loved as a child. Radiant meadows, mountains vaporous in the trembling distance; leaves ankle-deep on a gusty autumn road; bonfires and fog in the valleys; cellos, dark windowpanes, snow.""Then there are the characters! Richard somehow manages to edge into the small, exclusive Greek classics program run by the very enigmatic professor, Julian. The classics students, Richard included, see him definitely as a father-like figure, something each seemed to be lacking in their personal lives; but furthermore, he was nearly a god-like personage in their eyes. Richard is immediately attracted to this eccentric yet alluring group - Henry, Francis, Bunny, and the twins, Camilla and Charles.""… different as they all were they shared a certain coolness, a cruel, mannered charm which was not modern in the least but had a strange cold breath of the ancient world: they were magnificent creatures, such eyes, such hands, such looks—sic oculos, sic ille manus, sic ora ferehat.""What do you do when you feel disillusioned and bored with your daily life? What happens when you are under the spell of a charismatic nature like Julian’s? Naturally, the group is easily swayed by his words. Even after finishing the last page of this novel, I still ask the question to what extent was Julian responsible, either directly or indirectly, for the actions of these students.""Beauty is terror. Whatever we call beautiful, we quiver before it. And what could be more terrifying and beautiful, to souls like the Greeks or our own, than to lose control completely?""I won’t get into the rest of the plot. We are told from the very beginning that there is a murder and that this group is responsible. But this is not an ordinary whodunit, as we know this fact from page one. It’s all about the thrilling suspense leading up to the event as well as the gripping psychological tension. The claustrophobic feeling held me in its tight embrace throughout the second half or last third of the novel. There are certainly overtones ofCrime and Punishmentwithin. It also brought to mind the feeling I had while readingThe Talented Mr. Ripley. How could I actually find myself siding with the villain(s)? There was such a feeling of intimacy that Tartt created between the reader and Richard in this book, much like Highsmith did between the reader and Tom Ripley in her book. It’s ingenious!The Secret Historyis one of my favorite reads of the year, and will also sit on my favorites of all time shelf. It’s a literary thriller at its finest. As I was reading this on my kindle, I didn’t actually pay attention to the number of pages before I started. When I finished, I couldn’t believe this was actually 500+ pages. I could have read more! I had been about to start readingThe Goldfinch, but I have to thank my friend Pedro who convinced me that this one should be first. I’m certain this would have deserved 5 stars regardless of the order of reading, but I’m fully confident that his advice was wise! Now I can’t wait to continue my Tartt adventures.""I suppose at one time in my life I might have had any number of stories, but now there is no other. This is the only story I will ever be able to tell.""'}]"

The Shards
",Bret Easton Ellis,4.01,31190,3494,"Fiction, Thriller, Horror, Mystery, Contemporary, Mystery Thriller, Audiobook",595,17-01-2023,"A sensational new novel from the best-selling author ofLess Than ZeroandImperial Bedroomsthat tracks a group of privileged Los Angeles high school friends as a serial killer strikes across the city.Bret Easton Ellis's masterful new novel is a story about the end of innocence, and the perilous passage from adolescence into adulthood, set in a vibrantly fictionalized Los Angeles in 1981 as a serial killer begins targeting teenagers throughout the city.17-year-old Bret is a senior at the exclusive Buckley prep school when a new student arrives with a mysterious past. Robert Mallory is bright, handsome, charismatic, and shielding a secret from Bret and his friends even as he becomes a part of their tightly knit circle. Bret's obsession with Mallory is equaled only by his increasingly unsettling pre-occupation with The Trawler, a serial killer on the loose who seems to be drawing ever closer to Bret and his friends, taunting them--and Bret in particular--with grotesque threats and horrific, sharply local acts of violence. The coincidences are uncanny, but they are also filtered through the imagination of a teenager whose gifts for constructing narrative from the filaments of his own life are about to make him one of the most explosive literary sensations of his generation. Can he trust his friends--or his own mind--to make sense of the danger they appear to be in? Thwarted by the world and by his own innate desires, buffeted by unhealthy fixations, he spirals into paranoia and isolation as the relationship between The Trawler and Robert Mallory hurtles inexorably toward a collision.Set against the intensely vivid and nostalgic backdrop of pre-Less Than ZeroLA,The Shardsis a mesmerizing fusing of fact and fiction, the real and the imagined, that brilliantly explores the emotional fabric of Bret's life at 17-sex and jealousy, obsession and murderous rage. Gripping, sly, suspenseful, deeply haunting and often darkly funny,The Shardsis Ellis at his inimitable best.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'This utterly absorbing pseudo-autofictional variation onLess Than Zerowith thriller and un-true crime elements as well as an abundance of sex scenes reads like an over-the-top historical novel about the 80\'s - it\'s an eccentric pageturner and great, smart fun! Our protagonist and narrator is one Bret Ellis, a man who penned bestsellers like, you know,American Psycho. The fictional Ellis looks back at the year 1981 and the events that made him who he is: We learn about a psychopathic killer called the Trawler and an over-the-top cult who haunt Los Angeles, and they come for 17-year-old Bret and his friends who are seniors at the eliteBuckley School- needless to say, real-life Ellis also graduated from Buckley.In the novel, we meet the classic protagonists of every American high school drama: The simple-minded jock (Thom) and his prom queen girlfriend (Susan) - Bret is in love with both of them -, the spoiled rich friend of said prom queen (Debbie) who is Bret\'s girlfriend, the joint-smoking outsider (Matt) with whom Bret has sex, plus the hot mysterious guy (Ryan) with whom Bret also has sex (it\'s 1981, and people are not supposed to know about Bret being gay due to the stigmatization). The whole thing has a dark, sinister air: Most of the characters seem to know that they are playing roles, that this life of riches and parties is a charade, and of course there are tons of drugs, alcohol and sex to numb the pain. Enter Robert, the hot new guy (another stock high school drama character): Bret mistrusts him and, based on some possible hints, sets out on the quest to prove that he is indeed the Trawler, so a serial-killing maniac, all the while writing on a little novel called, you guessed it,Less Than Zero, about a bunch of disaffected high schoolers (ha! And did I mention that LTZ protagonist Clay has a poster of Elvis Costello on his wall, much like fictional Bret?).With the arrival of enigmatic Robert and the sudden death of Bret\'s secret lover Matt, heightened paranoia begins to disrupt the relations between the characters: Inspired by Susan\'s dispassionate demeanor (""numbness as ecstasy""), Bret has long started to build up a wall of alienation, but now this gets fueled by his fear of the Trawler and his investigations into Robert\'s intentions - Bret becomes, as he says,""the tangible participant"". He takes more and more drugs and becomes more and more unreliable - the fact that he is an aspiring writer known for his wild imagination also doesn\'t make him more trustworthy (this is a particularly wicked variation on the Künstlerroman). Another major factor dulling his perceptions is his constant teenage horniness: Even Robert might be terrifying, but he also turns him on. The novel is full of detailed sex scenes, as well as gruesome crime scene portrayals.To the sound of 80\'s music, watching classic 80\'s films and wearing hip popper clothes from the decade, Bret and his friends seem determined to fit in the general Hollywood panorama, to hold on to appearances that give them safety, which, as every Ellis novel tells us, is an ultimately futile endeavor. What makes ""The Shards"" so unbelievably fun is how self-conscious, how meta the text is: Ellis invents his own origin myth, he claims to tell us why he took on his persona and how he garnered his reputation by serving us a tale of un-true crime that treats the 80\'s as a historical decade - which, of course, they are, but it\'s just so sovereign how Ellis laughs about the datedness of what first made him zeitgeisty. The American Empire of the 80\'s, it\'s long gone, and this author knows it.Ellis remains a writer who refuses to be fully explained, to be placed and categorized - and he proves it with a novel that remixes his former work while turning the idea of autobiographical explanations into a travesty (see also Kracht\'sEurotrashand Greene\'sTravels with My Aunt). Ellis indulges in shifting the portrayal of his fictional ""Bret"" character into someone untrustworthy and glamorously sinister, and I\'m all here for the drama and the cheeky role play. With 700+ pages, this text could still be longer, because it is so enjoyable and, much like a series, opens a narrative space that invites readers to linger. I\'d love to see this as a movie or a series - although a true-to-the-novel rendition would clearly be R-rated! :-)Here\'s the Spotify playlist with all songs mentioned in the book:https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2pE...(Side note: Swiss Ellis fan and German-language literary superstarChristian Krachtrecently published a novel about an author called Christian Kracht that also refers to his own debut novel,Faserland, and that also mocks the idea of an explanatory, autobiographical origin story - and Kracht\'s novel is calledEurotrash, a term mentioned six times in Ellis\'American Psycho! WEIRD, and I love this crossover.)'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""bret: i've connected the two dotsme: you din't connect shitdisclaimer: i did not like this book and my review reflects of that. if you loved this book or if you are a diehard ellis fan, skip this review, don't @ me telling me i’m wrong for disagreeing with you or that everything that i didn't like was intentional: you are right, i didn't get it.still, i was able to form opinions that i will express in theentirely subjectivereview below which is less a review than a long-winded cathartic rant in the vain of Ellis, so read at your own discretion.This book had no business being this long. Sure, the first 100 pages or so were intriguing but i was bored by Bret's endless navel-gazing, horniness, and flexing (we get it, you have a gucci backpack and you lift weights) and the constant inane fighting with his 'cohort', which usually follows this formula:-what are you suggesting?b. what do you think i am suggesting?-i think you are suggesting something.b. why would you think that i was suggesting something?-i just dob. why would you say that?-say what?b. that i was suggesting something- because you are.b. i think robert is a FuCkiNG fREaK.Banal, polemical, self-indulgent, misogynistic, sensationalist, verbose, and frankly, just all over the place.Ellis is anedgelordwho brought to mind those wannabeauteurslike Sam Levinson whose work is desperately trying way too hard to be transgressive and brilliant. Sure, sometimes you can bring to the table both flash and substance, but sometimes, like in the case ofThe Shards, your attempts at flashiness are so forced, so ostentatious, so desperate, that you end up stripping your work of any actual substance. At times it seemed that this book was trying to be something like TSH, other times it adopts a true crime quality, but ultimately, it only succeeds in being trulycringe.I can think of so many works that succeed in exploring obsession, enmity, alienation, and repressed desire, in a way thatThe Shardsjust fails to. Titles likeApartmentby Teddy Wayne,These Violent Delightsby Micah Nemerever,New Peopleby Danzy Senna,Old Schoolby Tobias Wolff,Night Filmby Marisha Pessl. There are several films (of dubious quality) that present us with two delusional boys playing mind games, doing something ‘bad’ together, and you are not sure who is lying or who has the upper hand or if they want to kill or fuck each other such as Like Minds, Murder by Numbers, and Super Dark Times, that would probably succeed in being less dull thanThe Shards.Before this review devolves into what is likely to be a spoiler-y cathartic rant, I will give you the gist of things:this is a 700-tome of a book thatoozes self-importancebut beyond giving us detailed descriptions of everything worn by his peers (i could google ‘what did vanilla rich white teens wear in 1981/82’), providing us withevery singlestreet name he drives on (with as much passion as a sat nav), and using the same repetitive imagery and language to describe the bodies of the men around him (we get it, you are a horny teenager), it has nothing to say. Bret’s alienation and emptiness are established in the very first chapters, the rest of the novel doesn’t really elaborate on his malaise further. The true crime angle...it comes across as subpar true crime podcast that wants (but fails) to be something likeZodiacorI'll Be Gone in the Dark There.I genuinely thought that Ellis’ would have more to say about evil and the nature of evil, about darker instincts, violence, obsession, delusions, normalcy, queerness, about privilege. But it doesn’t.Sure, he succeeds in capturing the essence of a place and moment in time, but he often loses sight of the big picture, so that beyond presenting us with a generic group of rich white American kids whose successful parents are divorced/separated and emotionally distant (i can hear that *violin*), spend their time by the pool, partying, drinking and snorting coke, and the guys’ (whose personalities are variations of the bro/chad figure) exchange puerile wisecracks all the while blissfully unaware of just how privileged an existence they have.Despite Bret thinking that the story he is recounting is the mostshockingstory of all time, it was boring, shallow, and stupid even. There, I have said it. I usually don’t stoop to the level of calling a book I didn’t like stupid butThe Shardswas stupid. Once we passed the 30% mark, I no longer felt affected by the trying-too-hard-to-be suspenseful atmosphere, and neither Bret’s insufferable internal monologue nor his interactions with the obnoxious people around him challenged or inspired me. This book has nothing really to say and I should have heeded ellis' dedication (“for no one”).There is a long introduction that I did not read with close attention, as it was a lot of waffling and Ellis discussing how beneath his “prince-of-darkness literary persona” there is “an amiable mess, maybe even likable” (sure) and this story which has haunted him for years, and although he planned on writing it, for the longest time, he was unable to. The gist is that the events inThe Shardssupposedly happened. Still,The Shardsis marketed as a work of fiction, so I decided to approach it as such. But, if pressed, in the case that the events inThe Shardsare truly drawn from Ellis’ own personal real-life experiences, here is what I think: that's questionable. Sure, in some vague capacity, they may have happened but there is a lot of stuff that is...not so credible. Maybe this is due to Ellis’unrelentingover-dramatizing and his edgy self-fashioning, maybe due to how inane and unlikely certain exchanges between him and his friends were (in that they often seemed either scripted or hollow, like the type of conversations you have come across in media about american high schools), or maybe due him constantly going on about how at that point in time he wasn’t aware of the true narrative of things, in a way that tries to be suspenseful, makes you question who is playing who, but Ellis is so heavy-handed and repetitive in his foreshadowing that it really ends up being counterproductive.I have read enough mystery novels and a lot of academia-adjacent novels where we follow a clique of friends but someone is a bad egg and someone is cheating on someone else and someone is maybe gay etc., that can’t say that I found the scenes focusing on Bret’s ‘friends’ petty discussions or in-group fighting to be particularly riveting. Especially when Bret tries to tell us that the people in his clique are actually friends, and that he even loves Thom and Susan. Thom, Bret establishes early on, is drop-dead gorgeous and like almost every other young man he is friends with he is invisible compared to a greek statue, and we are reminded time and again that they all are tanned, blond, muscular, and so on. Now, Thom, we are told, has the personality of a golden retriever. And that’s pretty much it. I often forgot about his existence and the generic lines he gives gave me some strong NPC vibes. This is fitting in a way since Bret has a serious case of main character syndrome and occasionally says shit with some very strong red pill vibes. There are the girls, Susan and Debbie, who predictably fall into the Madonna/Whore dichotomy. Susan doesn’t have a personality as such, beyond being beautiful. Time and again, Bret will remind us that she is something else, Not Like Other Girls. Yet, she very much sounds like other girls. She has the most generic personality, her most distinguishing trait is that of being the object of desire of Thom and of Robert. Then there is Bret’s girlfriend…where to begin. The way Bret behaves towards her is disgusting. And I’m not even talking about what happens later on in the novel but from early on. His distaste for her person and her body, his completely denying her a mind, feelings, personality, depth, and so on, was dehumanizing. Bret’s misogyny proves that yes, sometimes, misogynists do come in shapes that are different from your good ol’ standard cis straight man mold. From the careless way, he calls her slutty, to the way he suggests that the way she comports herself is solely to gain male attention, to him being neglectful and dismissive of her, to his feeling more sympathy for Thom (whose parents have divorced) than Debbie (her mother is an alcoholic, and her ‘closeted’ father makes passes to her male friends). The sex scenes with her were a mix of grim (ragazza, file a restraining order) and turgid (of course, making this 'slutty' girl orgasm is easy for bret). Then there are the two boys Bret has flings with, one is the dopey stoner, Matt, and the other one is this Ryan guy who is very much the epitome of the bro. But of course, the true centerpiece in the novel is Robert, the new guy.Now for the first 100 pages, like I said, I feel almost hypnotized by the fevered quality of Bret’s recollections. In the opening pages time and again Bret says ‘I remember’, and the rhythm created by this repetition is mesmeric. These idyllic last days of summer brim with the promise of youth, yet, these are tainted by Bret’s ominous foreshadowing, as he refers to the danger to come, and that things will never be as they once were between him and his friends. Bret is suspicious of this new guy from the moment he learns about his existence, finding it strange that he would transfer for his senior year and that he was able to get into their exclusive school. We become aware that Bret believes he is playing pretend, a role even, and that once the school year is over he will be able to make a fresh start in college. The night before the first day of school, he happens to see someone sneaking around the school. The morning after, he learns that whoever snuck into the school likely was responsible for a perverse ‘prank’. Bret meets Robert, the new guy, who is nice enough, until Bret realizes that he saw Robert months earlier during a screening ofThe Shining. He brings this up but Robert denies that it was him. Bret keeps insisting in a way that is guaranteed to give second-hand embarrassment (that’s basically how he behaves throughout the novel). Bret tries to paint Robert as a sinister figure, hinting that on that first day, he was already lying to them about ‘stuff’. And by stuff, I mean that before enrolling in this school, he was in a psychiatric facility. Bret, who learns from Susan about this, decides that this proves that the guy is a freak. Bret convinces himself that Robert was responsible for the prank, based on him denying he was at the cinema + not telling Bret's clique that he was in a psychiatric facility (and why would he? the guy literally just met these people so not opening up about this doesn’t seem weird; after all, when bret learns about this he becomes hysterical, proving that robert was right in not disclosing his personal life story to them). Additionally, Bret seems to forget that he too is a liar. Anyway, Bret begins stalking Robert from the get-go and is scandalized that Robert catches him and isn’t happy with it (pretty sure bret calls robert a lunatic…which pot kettle mate). Every time he spends time with his bland group of friends Bret makes his outlandish feelings for and suspicions of Robert known and is frustrated that no one feels like he does. There are so many ridiculous scenes where an agitated Bret is about to have a hernia over Robert being a freak or responsible for ‘terrible’ things. Every-time Bret accuses Robert of this (to his face, to his friends, to adults) he is so apoplectic and hysterical it seemed weird that the people around him could move on from the frankly unhinged shit Bret just said.Bret’s paranoia is exacerbated by the sight of Robert and Matt (the guy he sleeps with) talking, and when something is up with Matt, Bret decides that Robert is responsible.Much of the narrative is about Bret either salivating over Robert or going on and on about what a ��freak’ he is, often painting him as some sort of a ‘psycho’ mastermind. I swear, there were times when Bret is fixated on using a certain type of imagery when interacting with Robert, one that hints at Robert’s having several ‘faces’, that madeThe Shardscome across as a third-rateDeath Note. Bret’s morbid delusions are repetitive and seem to stem from him being attracted to and jealous of Robert, and being impressively ignorant about mental health (which is weird given that he paints himself as being intelligent and astute, a reader and film enthusiast…wouldn’t he have read sylvia plath? watched one flew over the cuckoo's nest?).There are a lot of interactions that are about nothing. But not even in a realistic mumblecore way, these backwards and forwards were generic and often unconvincing. These conversations are meant to come across as intriguing, possibly hinting at the clique’s shifting allegiances and dynamics, but they succeed in only being bland and as insightful as a puddle. Bret’s friendship with these people is so shallow, that I didn’t ever feel particularly troubled by the supposed in-group tensions and petty fights. I understand that you might romanticize or come to mythologise certain aspects of your childhood or in this case your teenage years (which according to hollywood areeverything), but then, make us care too. But no, we have to have these preposterous backwards and forwards that go nowhere and achieve nothing. Turns out that Thom and Susan tell Robert that Bret doesn’t like him, Bret is angry at first but this never goes anywhere (do i even care though?). Bret keeps wanting to get involved in the love triangle between Thom, Susan, and Robert not so much because he actually cares and is worried about Susan, but because he believes that Thom “didn’t deserve this” and he wants to keep his clique as is. Bret is so noisy and sanctimonious about Susan’s love life, often demanding to know how she feels about Thom and/or Robert. His distaste for Susan and Robert’s behavior is rich coming from the guy who eventually becomes involved with his gf’s father. But Bret is quite venomous when it comes to Susan and Debbie being taken by Robert, which again, is quite hypocritical given that he spends way too much time fantasizing about Robert’s body.Eventually bad shit does happen and Bret is convinced that Robert is responsible. Not only because of him being a ‘freak’ and a ‘liar’ but at the party, Robert starts making obscene comments about what he would do to Susan. Rather than dissuading Susan from becoming involved with him by telling her what Robert said, whenever he speaks ill of Robert in front of others he just keeps going on about the same shit in a way that comes across as unfounded, irrational, and prejudiced, so no one, surprise surprise, takes him seriously. He even confronted Robert himself a couple of times, but these moments were far from suspenseful. The book wants you to think that it's this psychosexual cat-and-mouse game with a nihilistic vibe (in bret’s words: “numbness-as-a-feeling aesthetic”) butit all felt puerile, affected, and lacking any nuance whatsoever.Funnily enough, I haven’t even spoken about the whole serial killer/cult/true crime aspect of the story. There is this killer on the loose, girls disappear, houses are being broken into, and pets disappear. All of this troubles Bret, but not the people around him. Time and again he believes someone else is in the house with him or that he is being watched and so on. He soon enough becomes convinced that it is Robert. Based on what…? His earlier (mis)conceptions and delusions and paranoia? I don’t know. I wasn’t expecting Bret the misogynist to care about the victims or wonder about their lives, their fears and desires, but I did think that he would question the motives of this killer, think about what drives or compels someone to enact such violence and depravity (nurture? nature?) but he doesn’t. Robert is a ‘certified’ freak. That’s that.The story being set in LA also means that we get a ton of pages blabbering on celebrities, influential people, and the state of the entertainment industry in the 70s and 80s. The men in these rarefied spaces are granted semblances of personalities, and Bret even feels some degree of pity/empathy towards the ones he sees as old, washed-up, and pathetic. But…the women are not. This brings us back to Bret’s misogyny. Not only he doesn’t consider them as complex a being as man, but the way he talks about women left me with the impression that he did not attribute any sort of complexity or depth or intelligence, be it emotional or analytical, to them. Like many people who are way too obsessed with serial killers, he doesn’t give a shit about his victims (or at least, his female victims), he doesn’t think that someone like Debbie could experience anything meaningfully, he also views Susan as beautiful, and not much else, and sees her an object (either “unattainable” or be possessed by his bff thom), and all of the women over 30 are neurotic alcoholics.I found Bret to be an arrogant, hypocritical, edgelord whose navel-gazing (seghe mentali) is by no means as shocking, subversive, or intelligent as it wants to be.You know how (often) other's people dreams are just boring? Even when they are convinced of their dreams specialness? And they insist on recounting them to you even when you make it clear you are not that interested? That’s how I felt listening to Bret's interior and exterior blathering.I had the feeling that Ellis was trying hard to use certain motifs, but he does so inconsistently. But what really annoyed me was just how often Ellis felt the need to stoop to polemical asides, that try to make fun of younger generations for being pc, ‘sensitive’, and simplistic in their understanding of human nature (labeling people/things as good/bad)...in a way that, to use, as Ellis would say, the ‘parlance’ of today, is cringe. Mate, it’s embarrassing. Stop. We get it. Back then students could whistle at Susan and that was okay, she LIKED it even. Back then, a grown-ass man could proposition an underaged person, with the tacit and/or spoken understanding that in exchange for sexual favors they will be able to advance their career or something along those lines, without being labeled a predator. Boo-hoo. Bret even whines about when he thinks that someone like Thom would be called “in today’s parlance, a white privileged male, a king of the system”. Imagine that. How sad.review continues in comment section""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'AMERICAN PSYCHOMi chiesi se ci fosse un collegamento tra il richiamo del libro e il fatto che non fossi più interessato a scrivere per Hollywood.Eppure, caro Brett, anche se non hai più voglia di scrivere per Hollywood, questa tua ultima fatica, il libro che ho appena finito di leggere,The Shards – Le schegge, cos’è se non un grande omaggio a Hollywood? A quei film, tipo il recente magnificoBabylondi Damien Chazelle. A quel cinema che sa trasformare in epica la storia anche più ordinaria. Che ha tendenza all’autocelebrazione. Che intrattiene e al contempo spinge a riflettere. Che è curato in ogni dettaglio (visivo - e infatti, le debolezze più manifeste sono caso mai sulla scrittura, cinema indie a parte, ma quello è un altro discorso). Che è mastodontico, non più confinabile nel limite dei cento minuti (ma nulla mi toglie l’idea che dipenda soprattutto dal trionfo del video e dalla progressiva sparizione della pellicola).E poi, caro Brett, negli anni che racconti, quelli del Betamax, anch’io ero dalle tue parti, solo un po’ più a nord. Studiavamo cose diverse, ma entrambi a un college/università. Anni indimenticabili della mia vita. E anche della tua sembrerebbe a leggerti qui.Ma non ce ne fregava niente: eravamo fatti e giovani ed era una tiepida sera di primavera e stavamo entrando nel mondo degli adulti.Mondo nel quale da quella parti si entra a sedici anni, l’età della patente. E quindi, prima che adulti, ciò che conta è diventare autonomi, avere una macchina, quattro ruote e le chiavi di casa, andare dove si vuole, e tornare all’ora che si vuole.Poi, certo, le cose possono migliorare se si è ricevuto in dono un portapillole di Gucci – oggettini che ricordo bene – da riempire di pillole, pilloline, polverina, magia, e sogni.Caro Bret, hai scoperchiato il mio vaso dei ricordi. Forse perché ripeti spesso, ricordo, io ricordo.Ma io credo dipenda soprattutto dal fatto che sei bravo, che sei uno scrittore che sa confondermi, facendomi credere che quello che scrivi sia tutto vero. Che la Los Angeles flagellata dal serial killer faccia venire alla mente i romanzi di Ellroy. Mentre è facile – o almeno dovrebbe esserlo – supporre che il gioco di incastri è raffinato, sai mischiare ad arte vero e falso, verità e finzione. E che il Pescatore a Strascico, e Matt e Thom e Debbie e Susan siano tutte invenzioni del tuo talento narrativo.E certo ci voleva la tua abilità per farmi interessare e amare una banda di adolescenti ricchi e viziati e privilegiati, rigorosamente bianchi, iscritti a un club sulla spiaggia che tra i suoi soci non accetta né ebrei né neri, perennemente fatti o strafatti di sostanze varie (erba, coca, Valium, Quaalude – quarant’anni dopo, Tavor e Xanax) e/o alcol (vodka e tequila – quarant’anni dopo, gin), sempre firmati dalla testa ai piedi (anche se poi nella scelta dello shampoo e del bagno schiuma vanno molto sul banale), automuniti di Corvette, Mercedes, Porsche, Jaguar, con serbatoio illimitato. Farmi palpitare per questi Susan e Debbie e Bret e Ryan e Matt e Thom e Robert che del mondo conoscono MTV sitcom e soap opera più qualche film, che aprono un quotidiano solo per vedere l’inizio degli spettacoli e i concerti in programma.Insomma, caro Bret, se le tue settecento pagine abbondanti le ho lette in poco più di quattro giorni, un motivo ci sarà; se il tuo libro non riuscivo a chiuderlo e metterlo giù, un motivo ci sarà; se ti ho divorato, e quando diventi violento e sadico e horror mi hai messo perfino strizza, un motivo c’è.era festoso, era divertente, era ‘gay’Eravate dèi, vero Bret? Belli, splendenti, folgoranti. Ma, innocenti mai, quello proprio no.O devo pensare che anche adesso ti piace esagerare e tutto lo splendore che racconti, di Robert e Thom e Ryan, è il tuo gusto di aggiungere e colorare e rendere più interessante? E anche se son passati quarant’anni, anche col senno di poi, rimani lo stesso Bret del 1981, diciassettenne, quello che esagerava, come i tuoi amici sapevano bene.quell’estetica “insensibilità come sentimento” che mi attirava tanto e che stavo cercando di perfezionare in “Meno di zero”… l’insensibilità come sentimento, l’insensibilità come movente, l’insensibilità come ragione d’esistere, l’insensibilità come estasi.Parli del Pontormo, del suo splendido quadro sulla Deposizione, con quei colori pazzeschi: che tu sembri voler trasferire ai vestiti indossati dai tuoi personaggi, e come ti sai prendere i tuoi tempi, come sai dilatare le pagine, lasciare il lettore nell’attesa, e colorare le atmosfere, renderle, come sai arricchire di dettagli, il mestiere consolidato che dimostri e sfoggi, la scelta di un mega romanzo da oltre settecento pagine… questo e altro fanno pensare che anche per te, questa volta, come per il Pontormo a suo tempo, si possa parlare di manierismo (adoro quel periodo pittorico, sono i miei eroi, ho rivoltato Firenze a caccia di tutti quei dipinti, chiedendo permessi e facendomi aprire porte normalmente chiuse).Non sapevo esattamente come descrivere “Meno di zero”. E non volevo farlo: era su di ‘me’ ma non c’era una storia, c’erano ‘scene’ ma non aveva una vera trama, c’era solo un tono sordo, divagante, che cercavo di perfezionare… a me non importava cosa ‘facessero’ i personaggi. Esistevano, e volevo solo trasmettere uno stato d’animo, immergere il lettore in un’atmosfera particolare creata da dettagli attentamente selezionati.E se a questo giro ti tratto bene e con affetto e perché tu per primo mi hai trattato bene, e con affetto, regalandomi questo corposo divertente libro che ti vede tornato ai tuoi tempi migliori. Al punto che ti esibisci in un micro mea-culpa che molto ti fa perdonare:Quel personaggio tipo principe delle tenebre che i miei lettori da sempre pensavano incarnassi stava infine svanendo, per essere sostituito da qualcuno di più solare – l’uomo che aveva scritto “American Psycho”, scoprivano certi con stupore, era in realtà un affabile disastro, forse addirittura simpatico, lontanissimo da quel nichilista superficiale che tanti mi avevano cucito addosso e con cui probabilmente avevo gigioneggiato. Ma non si era mai trattato di una posa studiata.E poi non devo, né posso, dimenticare che come me sei un grande fan di Joan, questa passione la condividiamo.E poi, mi sa che questa volta hai superato te stesso. E adesso non ho più scuse, uno o due dei tuoi storici, devo andare a recuperarlo.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Did I just read this nearly 750 page book in two days? Tell me you’re crazy without telling me you’re crazy. In my defense, I didn’t realize how long this was before I requested it from the library. I simply saw B.E.E. had a new release and Mitchell said he would hurt me if I didn’t get it immediately. I think I was like a billion and a half down the wait list too, but ended up getting this within a week of asking for it so I think it’s safe to say others either were intimidated by the sheer volume or realized pretty darn quickly this wasn’t for them and returned it. And to whoever you are I say THANK YOU for letting me get my grubby little mitts on it post haste.Now on to the book. Simply put, this is about . . . .“the memories I had of the Trawler and more specifically of Robert Mallory.”Written as a nonfiction narrative, this one is for the Bret Easton Ellis superfan. I mean, if you ever wanted to crawl around inside this fella’s brain,The Shardsis the one for you! After finishing I did a Google to see what was said about this “true story” before it was released and I am amazed at how many people were duped. Dear Dummies: YOU LITERALLY HAVE A COMPUTER ATTACHED TO YOUR HAND ALMOST ALL THE TIME. It’s not hard to find out these cases didn’t actually happen. Not to mention he is an author who previously wrote a “true story” about fucking vampires. And also . . .I was a storyteller and I liked decorating an otherwise mundane incident that maybe contained one or two facts that made it initially interesting to be retold in the first place but not really, but adding a detail or two that elevated the story into something legitimately interesting to the listener and gave it humor or surprise or shock, and this came naturally to me. These weren’t lies exactly – I just preferred the exaggerated version.I just found out this was initially released as a serial story – new entries were written every two weeks and read by Ellis himself on his podcast. My first reaction to that? Oh yeah, I would have read the crap out of this as a serial. Followed immediately by, ewwwww, B.E.E. even YOU have a podcast?With that knowledge now is the time to disclose that while I’m the first to say “don’t you have an editor?!?!?!?!” – on this occasion I’m giving a pass – because there literally was no editor nor any intention that this would be released as a physical book when it was initially created.But I wasn’t kidding when I said this is for the superfan. Basically it reads like a high school journal written by someone with extreme literary chops and covers Bret Easton Ellis’ senior year at Buckley in 1981. Ellis more than dabbles in sex (both of the hetero and nonhetero varieties) and drugs, works on his debut novelLess Than Zero, finds himself a member of the “me too” movement nearly 40 years prior to its time and develops a bit of an obsession with the new boy in school who he believes might just be a serial killer. Oh, and also? It is QUINTESSENTIALLY 1980s. We’re talking popped collars, Topsiders, ray bans and a detailing of every single song that was playing at any moment throughout his days. It certainly is not a book for everyone, but it was most definitely for me. All the Stars.Whistling tunes we hide in the dunes by the seaside . . . .'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Bret Easton Ellis, most famous for his books American Psycho and Less than Zero, has penned a wicked tale, one that is at once bewildering, terrifying, and completely absorbing.""We were teenagers distracted by sex and pop music, movies and celebrity, lust and ephemera and our own neutral innocence.""We go back to the days when Bret himself was a senior at the private Buckley School in Sherman Oaks, CA. The year is 1981. He and his uber wealthy friends plan to spend their final year in high school under the haze of alcohol, cocaine, quaaludes, and anything else they can get their greedy little hands on. Kids with""a what-the-fuck entitlement""as they are described in the book. The year starts off well enough until a new kid, Robert Mallory, joins the mix. Bret is curious as to why someone would transfer from Chicago to LA in their final year in high school. He immediately gets bad vibes from Robert yet his friends are all welcoming him into their elite group.Meanwhile, in the background of this story is The Trawler, a serial killer that is targeting, torturing, and killing young women. Bret gets obsessed with the story yet no one else seems to be paying attention. Certainly none of his friends are interested. Maybe it\'s the writer in him but he begins to build a time line of the murders and they all coincide with Robert Mallory coming and going from LA. Is it possible that Robert is The Trawler?This book is a hard book to describe. It seems semi-autobiographical but it really is a work of fiction. I hit up Google many times while reading this to try and figure out what is real and what isn\'t. The Trawler was a serial killer in LA in 1981 but he targeted elderly women. Bret took that story and spun it to fit the narrative of this book and it was super successful. I was creeped out and chilled to the bone on several occasions. Having said that please be warned that this book is not for the faint of heart. The descriptions of the murders for some will be beyond disturbing and nightmare inducing. As a reader you will also have to endure all sorts of debauchery. If teens getting high and having sex is a no no for you then move right along. I would describe this book as hypersexual. There is a lot of male/male sex, some male/female sex, and a whole lot of masturbation. I\'ve mentioned before that I don\'t need to know all the nitty gritty details of sex in my books but it does work here because there is absolutely nothing erotic about it. It sets the tone and atmosphere of not only the place but the time being 1981 when homosexuality was still firmly in the closet.What is stopping me from giving this book 5 stars is the length. This book is over 600 pages long and incredibly dense. There is a lot of text on the page so you can\'t just fly through this. This book demands that you take your time. I personally think an editor could trim this down and make this book a masterpiece. For example there is a lot of driving around the LA area:I took Avenue of the Stars and would make a left onto Santa Monica and then drive South Beverly Glen until it hit Bel Air Road where I would swing a right onto Bellagio, which would take us to Stone Canyon.I was on the freeway and realized in a daze that I was flying through the Cahuenga Pass when I saw the Hollywood Cross lit above the Ford Ampitheatre and I found myself racing across the 101 passing through Burbank and Studio City and then Sherman Oaks and Encino and Tarzana, until I was out in Woodland Hills, where I drove through the now empty parking lot of the Promenade.Now for someone from the area this may be really cool but for someone like myself on the East coast all these driving scenes got a little tedious because I wasn\'t able to visualize them at all. Maybe I should have pulled up a Google map of the area but, come on, who really wants to put that much work into reading a book.So yeah, my only complaint is some editing because this book is sensational otherwise. A+ for the cover art as well. 4 stars!TW: ALL OF THEMThank you to NetGalley and Knopf for my complimentary copy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'The author opens up with a section telling how it’s taken him some forty years to write this book. It is, he says, based on events he witnessed; acts of violence perpetrated on people he knew, friends. He says that he’d tried to write the book years ago but at that time the act of recalling events he’d lived through had freaked him out so much he’d ended up in hospital, suffering from the mother of all panic attacks. When he was a high school senior, at seventeen years of age, a new boy had arrived at his school and joined his friendship group. This boy, it was later revealed, had had a difficult past and though on the face of it he seemed to be fully adjusted, he was actually anything but. He was to become a prowler, a killer and he was to badly hurt at least one of Bret’s close friends.Bret Easton Ellis attended The Buckley School in Los Angeles, an establishment available to the rich and pampered. At the time of the events he covers here his parents were away on a long trip abroad, so he’d been left at home for an extended period with the family dog and a maid who prepared his breakfast and cleaned up after him. All his friends similarly lived in grand houses, drove expensive cars and seemed to have free rein to do whatever they wanted. In addition, they all had access to the drugs of their choice. Bret had a girlfriend, Debbie, but in all honesty he wasn’t sure if he preferred guys; he was at that juncture where adolescence is about to make way to adulthood, but he wasn’t quite there – he references this thought a number of times.Set in 1981, Bret talks a lot about the music he and his friends were listening to, and this fixed the timeframe in my mind too, with British singers such as Joe Jackson, Elvis Costello and Glenn Tilbrook also being amongst my favourites in the early Eighties. Having been transfixed by the opening section I truly believed I was reading a true account of events Bret had lived through, and yet as I came across long conversations which he repeated seemingly verbatim and detailed recollections regarding his own thoughts at that time, I concluded that a degree of artistic license was in play. So what was this: a factual account, a piece of fiction or something in between? I couldn’t really work it out. But I didn’t dwell on this too long as either way I was fully invested by now.It’s a lengthy story - I listened to a 22 hour long audio version, read by the author – but every time I paused I just couldn’t wait to get back to it. I found it to be such a compelling story, and hearing it told through Bret’s voice added something for me. It just felt right. There’s a lot sex and violence here, much of it very graphic. There are other disturbing scenes too, so this one is definitely not for the squeamish or faint-hearted. But there is a richness in the writing and in the narrative that I believe lifts it above all but the very best books. As I approached the end I thought I’d worked it all out, but a surprising and somewhat ambiguous ending cast some doubt on that. It’s definitely one of the most mysterious, addictive and truly impactful books I’ve come across in a very long time.My sincere thanks to W. F.

Not sure what prompted me to buy this book… I was never a big fan of BEE; his transgressive novels didn’t quite resonate with me (my vote goes to JG Ballard); but then again this was some time ago (almost 20 years!), so I said lets give it another go.Familiar themes: L.A. setting in the 1980s > loss of innocence & alienation > over-privileged, spoiled, entitled rich kids playing hardball (or they think so) > boring days and hedonistic nights full of sex, drugs and rock & roll (all in excess – with plethora of “explicit” content)…and a serial killer.Nothing new or provocative that haven’t been said; no seismic revelations; transgressive enough to remind me the same old BEE with similar form, structure and narrative as his previous novels (Less than Zero & American Psycho spliced together). Saying that, somehow I ve enjoyed The Shards more! It seemed that this autofictional, “self-trolling” melodrama’s main purpose was some short of “release” from the angst of the moment. It oozed a kind of melancholic dreamy aura, a longing that reverberated throughout; and in the end deliverance!Sustain the illusion till finally be free…Give it a try…*Some better editing would have definitely helped the narrative.**Multiple references of 80’s songs played a significant role in the novel: e.g. Icehouse (by Icehouse): Now is colder every day. There is no love inside the icehouse: “ I remember the power of the song had the first time we played it in Susan’s car as we drove across the Sunset Boulevard and through Beverly Hills and the vocals were yearning for something better than what the lyrics offered and the chorus was about dreams, about hope, which were intensified by the doomy romanticism of the overall track itself.”'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""In generale Ellis mi fa paura per motivi scontati, perché chissà che cazzo ha nella testa.

E non sapevo come sarebbe andata con Le schegge.Ma ho trovato un Ellis diverso, cresciuto pur 17enne, più misurato nella violenza che è comunque imprevedibilmente perversa e dilagante, assurda, quasi ridicola. Qui c'è tantissimo sangue umano e non umano, ma l'orrore è anche e soprattutto all'interno, e filtra dai buchi della maschera che tutti indossano, che lascia qualche spiraglio per cercare di respirare un po' e non soffocare nel costume di scena, o per fare un altro tiro di coca. Il teatro allestito dall'Ellis scrittore e dall'Ellis protagonista del romanzo va a fuoco, il sogno finisce e tutti sono protagonisti e artefici di un incubo in cui le colpe si intrecciano, come le mani di due amici del liceo che come sempre accade credono che quell'amicizia invincibile, che li scaglia contro il mondo della corruzione adulta, sarà davvero per sempre.Incalzante, respingente, intrigante.

After hearing that @gareindeedreads loved it, I decided to go for it!THE SHARDS is a dark metafiction novel that will continue to psychologically mess me up even after reading. I’m literally trying to figure it out now. The story involves a group of best friends at the Buckley School in Los Angeles during the 1980s. Our protagonist, Bret details his teenage years with this tight-knit group—money, drugs, parties, sex—this group lived a very intense life at a formidable time during their lives. Their lives, however, are forever changed when a serial killer begins claiming victims that are hitting close to home and it just so happens to line up with the arrival of a new student joining their senior class. This book starts off relatively slowly, but the subject matter gripped me from the moment I started. It’s a long book at around 600 pages, but I caught myself reading it whenever I could.THE SHARDS is a book about obsession and lots of gay sex—but it’s also a coming of age story, sort of, with powerful messaging.

He has performed all these tricks before -- the gratuitous clinical depravity, the quirky blending of autobiography and fiction, the ultra-dry satire.

I liked certain aspects of Less Than Zero but wanted more plot. This one pulls heavily from Less than Zero but brings in the meta element that I loved from Lunar Park.In terms of plot, this one was heavily focused on the drugs and sexual encounters of the author's (fictional) past. While I enjoy more edgy topics, I found it a lot for the length of the novel. This setup worked a little better in the smaller package, Less than Zero. I wished there had been more focus on the serial killer subplot, which I found the most interesting.Yet, despite my mixed feelings while reading this one, I found myself very emotionally satisfied by the ending. My brain cannot stop wondering how much is true in this fictionalized story. I think the author's sexually active, drug persona is just what makes this book work.

My reading relationship with Bret Easton Ellis is messy. I devoured AMERICAN PSYCHO with a frenzy. I had a sorta similar experience with LESS THAN ZERO. But all of his other fiction left me tepid. So, I was a little apprehensive about starting this, especially with its large page count. Which BEE was I going to get here? Well damn, this book sunk its ferocious fangs into me from the first page and kept me in its clamped jaw the entire time. This is his best work since AMERICAN PSYCHO. It may even have surpassed it in my mind. Christ, this is a freak show odyssey.Several people noted that this novel desperately needed an editor, and I’m usually one to jump on that hill, but I’m going to admit that the sprawling, repetitive, and excessive nature of the narrative is the novel’s strength. The overindulgent and unrestricted nature adds to the paranoia of the narrator (and the reader). It feels oppressive and makes us feel like we can’t get out of this thick, dark, twisted web. So much of the horror is in the unrelenting claustrophobic vibe. I honestly think this book wouldn’t be quite so effective if it was a shortie.THE SHARDS is structured in a rather clever (and cheeky) way. Bret Easton Ellis is the narrator and he is acting as himself writing autoficton on his high school years. Ellis reimagines that time as an era where he and his friends, in their senior year, are terrorized by the presence of The Trawler, a serial killer who targets teenage girls in Los Angeles. Bret is convinced that the shy and beautiful new kid, Robert Mallory, is connected to these horrific killings. As the novel evolves, Bret becomes obsessed with his theories. But then there are also added complexities to Bret’s anxiety: he’s a closeted and is also attracted to Robert (!!!!) As Bret gets dangerously and obsessively closer and closer to trying to prove to everyone that Robert is not who he says he is, we start to wonder who the real psycho is: Robert or our dear Bret?Ellis is up to old tricks with this one: The 1980s are glamorous, slick, and hedonistic. All the teenagers are privileged, entitled, jaded, ultra-horny, drug-induced, and left unsupervised. All of the adults behave as if they’re younger than their kids. Everyone has a flat and cynical way of talking. However, Ellis has amped up the gay sex in this. Same with the gore and violence (the descriptions of The Trawler’s victims are especially hard to stomach). And IT ALL WORKS!!Ellis keeps the disturbing and ominous vibe going the entire way through (I’m legit impressed how well he did that for 600 pages), but the last 200 pages amps up the menace to the stratosphere. It’s a pressure cooker. There’s a particular scene in a Palm Springs house that legit had me on edge. The way it was described was unsettling; that scene has lingered. And that is the genius of this novel: I didn’t realize just how much the book was getting under my skin until that scene. That’s when I came to realize I had been going through a “quiet trauma” (and also proof to me that the chunky length of the book is needed) I’ve consumed lots of horror books and movies, yet that scene made me turn on my alarm system shortly afterward.I could go on and on, but I’ll end with this: I’m so glad Ellis kept so much of the ending on an ambiguous note; so many loose ends, so many elements for us to consider and analyze ourselves. I had a theory on how the book was going to end, and it did not happen. But with all this ambiguity, perhaps I’m right. Genius book and one of my faves of the year, more things I never thought I’d say.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'The Shardsis another Bret Easton Ellis novel in which the author includes a warped version of himself as a character: this time, 17-year-old Bret Ellis is a student at Buckley, a prestigious LA prep school, in the 1980s. One can assume many details of the plot, in which Bret parties with his similarly wealthy friends and struggles with his sexuality and episodes of existential dread, are true to life – but the book diverges from reality when it introduces a serial killer, ‘The Trawler’, who seems somehow connected to Bret’s magnetic new classmate Robert Mallory. I understand the story was originally serialised on the author’s podcast, and it bears the hallmarks of that – it rambles on and on, various pieces of information and characterisation are repeated – but the overall effect is somehow hypnotic. There’s some brilliant writing about nostalgia for youth. The reader is completely immersed in this glossy 80s milieu, complete with detailed settings and enough mentions of specific songs to make a lengthy soundtrack playlist if you want.

Overall, I didn’t hate it (though at times I thought I did). I was mostly engaged (though I did think it was going to become a DNF at around 300/400 pages), but I ploughed on.Mainly, it’s far too long. The strength of the plot does not support it’s length. It’s overwhelmingly overwritten. A bit like Ian McEwan’s ‘Lessons’, it just felt like a vanity project for Ellis, wanting to write an epic. His own ‘Secret History’ (which I was also a bit ‘meh’ about.)And whilst we’re talking about vanity… take a moment to think about Ellis, nearing 60 yrs old, writing himself into a story, as a 17 yr old, who’s having (almost constant) sex with ridiculously hot young guys (we’re talking Bruce Weber models by the sounds of Ellis’ fantasies). Of which we get pretty detailed accounts. So, erm, yeah, ok…To Ellis’ credit (I think), these aren’t just purely wank fantasies however, as none of them ever amount to anything, and he’s always left, somewhat heartbroken, on the sidelines.And unfortunately for Ellis (whom I’m sure was hoping it would be) none of it is particularly shocking. Not compared to some of the things I’ve read over the last year. If you were shocked by 50 Shades, probably stay away from this, but I think most other literary adults will be like, ‘And?’(Except for the fish… if like me, you hate fish, let this be a warning! 🫣)If you like Ellis, read it.

BEE’s writing is always sharp, clever, and oozes with dark humor. So, OF COURSE, I needed to read his upcoming release THE SHARDS as quickly as possible. I mean, it’s his first novel in 13 years!!! I was Patrick-Bateman-excited to receive this copy and so I read.THE SHARDS is metafiction and just over 600 pages. Bret and his tight knit circle of friends attend a prestigious prep school during 1980s Los Angeles, CA. Sex, drugs, greed, and general debauchery ensue. And like everything with BEE novels, the setting and his choice of era are always a character. This is a dark and disturbing read - THE SHARDS will stay with me for a long long time. Not to mention, there is a serial killer on the loose. Need I say more? Pub 1/17'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '...a boy, his friends, young people in LA, sexy, a little bi, drugs, someone is killed, there\'s a chase, violence and bloodshed, a mystery that the boy solves or maybe not, I preferred the downer ending but we could make it upbeat as well, I\'d offer, we could negotiate that.The way fictional young Bret Ellis, the narrator ofThe Shards, imagines pitching his screenplay to a producer is of course self-satire on the author\'s part, a list of all the components an AI would need to write its own Ellis knockoff (though let\'s pause to imagine Chat GPT trying to figure out ""a little bi""), but it\'s also a pretty good description of the novel, right down to its openness to interpretation and slipperiness, its somewhat taunting quality.I wasn\'t sure what to expect from Ellis after all these years.Lunar Parkcame out in...(checks notes)...\'05, a few years after I\'d gotten into his 80s and 90s work, and I thought it was just okay. I was pretty much Ellised-out by the timeImperial Bedroomswas released in \'11, though I did read it (in a single afternoon in a bookstore- it\'s short), and I remember concluding that Ellis didn\'t seem interested in writing novels anymore.But as much asImperial Bedroomsfelt like the fulfillment of a contractual obligation,The Shardsfeels like something Ellis very much wanted to write. It\'s a return to the time and setting ofLess Than Zero- or to a few years earlier rather, 1981 to be specific- and on one hand it plays like his greatest hits: young people in LA, drugs, a little bi, a little apathetic, SoCal place names that I could never locate on a map, the proximity of the desert, ominously decontextualized pop lyrics, coyotes, the canyons, depraved serial-killer shit lurking in the background. A thesis could probably be written about the pandemic and the accompanying tendency to look backwards and get lost in nostalgia, but that\'s also something these details generated in me- nostalgia for Ellis\'s older novels that is, like hearing a new Tony Iommi solo after years between albums. That\'s a comparison by the way that is in one sense inappropriate, because Black Sabbath isn\'t the kind of music that Ellis seems to enjoy, but in another sense appropriate, because a) Sabbath goes perfectly with the novel\'s autumnal setting and atmosphere of slow-building doom, and b) appropriate in a general way because, as alluded to above, another of Ellis\'s old tricks (in common with Stephen King) is his use of music (you could sayThe Shardsliterally hasa soundtrack- thanks to Meike for posting it), finding dark undercurrents in the lyrics of The B-52s and The Psychedelic Furs and Pat Benatar.On the other hand,The Shardsis also very different from Ellis\'s 80s and 90s writing. For one thing, it felt to me (at least initially) like one of the most traditionally-structured things he\'d ever written. The story is preoccupied after all with one of the most archetypal of passages, from adolescence to adulthood, and pivots on the archetypal encounter (found in everything fromThe Great GatsbytoWall Street) between a young and seemingly innocent person- in this case fictional Bret Ellis- and a shadowy charismatic figure who opens up a world of moral depravity that the seemingly innocent person is both repelled by and drawn to (maybe like my teenage self and Ellis novels), in this case a new student at Bret\'s high school named Robert Mallory. There\'s also a serialized quality to the novel (which I guess makes sense, considering that Ellis originally read it aloud as a series of installments on his podcast), with hints doled out and grim tidings foreshadowed and other lowbrow tactics of suspense utilized- none of which I can claim to be immune to any longer, if I ever was. It\'s not that Ellis\'s early writing was unstructured, but there was always this meandering disjointed quality (which I enjoyed), always room for the narrative to drift with its aimless characters. There\'s room for that inThe Shardsas well (it\'s 600 pages, after all), and Ellis is still great at bringing you into the rhythm of his characters\' somewhat repetitive lives and making that compelling in itself, but combining that quality with an occasional shameless cliffhanger and real suspense creates a narrative momentum that I\'m not sure any of his other novels have.In addition to initially thinkingThe Shardswas somewhat traditionally-structured (the structure kind of shatters in the last couple of hundred pages), I also found myself believing for a while that it was one of the sweeter and more earnest things Ellis had written, the hints of darkness at the margins mostly affectations and lingering narrative tics ultimately in service of a nostalgia trip about his coming-of-age and discovering of his homosexuality. Itisabout those things, or at least a fictionalized version of them, but it was also kind of thrilling to slowly realize what kind of story this really was, and how less noble Ellis\'s intentions actually were, so I won\'t say much more except that Stephen King is a much closer reference point than, say,The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Ellis in particular seems to prefer the earlier, nastier King, as do I, and we hear about fictional Bret\'s admiration for\'Salem\'s LotandCujo. An important plot development takes place at a screening ofThe Shining. And well, millions of people like Stephen King, but what impressed me was that the atmosphere ofThe Shardsactually rivals those classics. Ellis has flirted with King\'s genre as far back asLess Than Zero, but it\'s usually been on the periphery of his stories- dark rumors of Manson-like activities in the canyons, recounted by laconic and indifferent narrators. He\'s never done anything like the slow-burn horror thatThe Shardsturns out to be, and which prompted Christine Smallwood, ina perceptive reviewthat you shouldn\'t read until you\'ve finished the novel, to note Ellis\'s “once-in-a-generation talent for conjuring dread.” She does go on, in her mixed review, to write that ""Ellis\'s stark and unsentimental moral vision is blind to half of human truth, and in this way has remained as childlike as the innocence it wants to dispel"", which isn\'t exactly a compliment, and which echoes the words of some random guy on Reddit who I happened to see comment that Ellis is ""...a bottomless pit of Gen-X darkness and nihilism."" Both points probably have some validity, but I think also help account for why the last couple of hundred pages are so harrowing.In short, I found this as playful, elusive, hypnotic, immersive, and yeah- malevolent- as anything I\'ve read of Ellis\'s. The only thing is that, unlikeThe Rules of AttractionandAmerican Psycho, it\'s not funny. Still, the most honest comment I can probably make is that I wished the 600 pages had been more like 1,000. It also made me wish I could remember what I did with my old Vintage paperbacks ofLess Than ZeroandRules(both books obviously still in print, but now displayed in stores with requisitely awful modern covers instead of the austere and evocative photos of LA and an empty bed, respectively- the Vintage editions seem harder to find these days), both of which I suspect, at some point in my mid-20s and in thrall to David Foster Wallace and his repudiation ofAmerican Psycho, I either allowed myself to be very careless with or maybe even got rid of, just like a good Trotskyite.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I\'m a bit shocked that, with over 1,200 reviews, this is still hanging over the 4-star mark.

This has got to be the most undisciplined writing I\'ve plowed through for many, many years. Sure, a lot of novels (esp. of late) tend to be verbose, but they pale compared to this.

Sometimes it did. Sometimes it didn't. Most of the time I was just reading about spoiled, horny teenagers in LA. Partying, thinking they're important, doing drugs, creating drama, having sex (lots of details in that department). Which is all great, and could have worked if it was just part of the story instead of most of the story. Call me crazy, but when you're reading 608-page book that technically also has a serial killer subplot... you kind of want more about that serial killer and less about horny teens. Is it just me? It can't be just me. And to be honest, the way things wrapped up was really frustrating.Now, I am picking up on how the incessant desire to matter and be noticed, as well as to be taken seriously plays into the story that unfolds. I get it. It's interesting. Even despite some of dialogue that keeps going in circles, I still think the writing itself was mostly interesting and effective. But overallThe Shardsjust didn't do enough of anything to justify its length. I was often bored and it was repetitive. There, I said it. It wasn't awful, I didn't hate it, but generally it was aggressively OK.This was my first Bret Easton Ellis novel, and it seems like I chose poorly.

Ich war 17 Jahre alt, als sich für mich durch junge Autoren der US-Popliteratur neue literarische Welten eröffneten. ""Unter Null"" erschien 1986 erstmals auf deutsch als rororo-Taschenbuch. Im selben Jahr erschien auch das noch bessere ""Ein starker Abgang"" von Jay McInerney, mit dem zusammen Bret Easton Ellis das Literary Brat Pack anführte. Auch noch in 1986 erschien ""Die verlorene Sprache der Kräne"" von David Leavitt. 1987 kam das grandiose ""Großstadtsklaven"" von Tama Janowitz. 1988 erschien der erste Roman von Michael Chabon ""Die Geheimnisse von Pittsburgh"". 1991 sollte Bret Easton Ellis mit ""American Psycho"" erneut die literarische Welt erschüttern.Da das Internet noch nicht im Alltag angekommen war, hat man sich über Musik und Literatur in Zeitschriften informiert. Es gab die ""Spex"" mit dem Fokus auf Musik. Die Literatur kam aber durchaus auch vor. Mit Texten von Rainald Goetz oder der Möglichkeit im Spex-Shop die englischsprachige ""American Psycho""-Ausgabe zu bestellen (via Postkarte). ""Tempo"" galt als ""Lifestyle""-Magazin, war aber viel mehr. Hier gab es auch die junge Literatur. In der ""Tempo"", die 1986 zum ersten Mal erschien, schrieben Autoren wie Christian Kracht, Maxim Biller oder Uwe Kopf. Andrian Kreye ist ein ehemaliger ""Tempo""-Autor, der auf Spotify eine knapp zehnstündige Playlist mit sämtlichen Songs, die in ""The Shards"" vorkommen, kuratiert hat. Das parallele Hören der Musik und Wiedererkennen vieler Songs hebt den Roman noch einmal auf eine weitere Ebene. In ""Tempo"" erschien 1992 die Reportage ""Less Than Zero"" von Kracht. Hier schliesst sich der Kreis zu Bret Easton Ellis und einer Zeit, die ich als unerhört aufregend in Sachen Literatur empfunden habe und miterleben durfte.Das brillante ""The Shards"" (""Die Scherben"") hat mich über mehr als 700 Seiten zurück in diese Zeit und diese Welt geführt. Es ist aber kein Nostalgie-Trip. Es ist ein Roman, der 1981 spielt. Die vordigitale Zeit, in der Easton Ellis an ""Unter Null"" arbeitet. Es ist wieder ein Roman über seelenlose, oberflächliche Rich Kids. Neben dem Nihilismus von ""Unter Null"" gibt es aber diesmal auch Empathie und Reflexion. Dummerweise aber auch einen Serienmörder. Das Buch ist ein Spiel mit simulierter Autofiktion, Gesellschaftsroman und literarischer Thriller in einem. Jede einzelne der 736 Seiten ist aufregend.

The Vegetarian

But the dreams—invasive images of blood and brutality—torture her, driving Yeong-hye to purge her mind and renounce eating meat altogether. It’s a small act of independence, but it interrupts her marriage and sets into motion an increasingly grotesque chain of events at home. As her husband, her brother-in-law and sister each fight to reassert their control, Yeong-hye obsessively defends the choice that’s become sacred to her. Soon their attempts turn desperate, subjecting first her mind, and then her body, to ever more intrusive and perverse violations, sending Yeong-hye spiraling into a dangerous, bizarre estrangement, not only from those closest to her, but also from herself.Celebrated by critics around the world, The Vegetarian is a darkly allegorical, Kafka-esque tale of power, obsession, and one woman’s struggle to break free from the violence both without and within her.A Best Book of the Year: BuzzFeed, Entertainment Weekly, Wall Street Journal, Time, Elle, The Economist, HuffPost, Slate, Bustle, The St. Louis Dispatch, Electric Literature, Publishers Weekly","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'This book wasn’t a casual read for me. This is deeply personal to my own beliefs. I’m a vegan. This book sung a song that I heard in my marrow; it made me realise so much.As a vegan I’ve experienced some of the things that I witnessed here. I can relate to it. I’ve lived it. I’ve been called a heretic. I’ve lost friends over it, and experienced much social awkwardness just for my lifestyle choice. I’m not pushy with my beliefs. Sometimes all it takes is a mention of the word “vegetarian” to be received with utter hostility or blankness. This review isn’t about the ethics involved with the diet. That’s not important to this story. What’s important is how people can react to someone different to themselves. The vegetarian in here acts as a metaphor for individual life choices.“I was convinced that there was more going on here than a simple case of vegetarianism.”For “the vegetarian,” being different to the world leads to social isolation and feelings of utter despair. Her husband is utterly useless in every regard. He is the sort of man who simply doesn’t deserve a wife. This no equal partnership, but the wife living to serve the man’s needs. It’s all about finding the right people, the accepting people in society. And this comes far too late and in far too a meek form to have any lasting effect on her: it came when she was already lost. The self-destructive behaviour isn’t testimony to a vegetarian diet. I speak from experience, these can be very healthy. It’s an act of rebellion against a society that refused to be warm to someone who didn’t conform.“the sight of her lying there utterly without resistance, yet armored by the power of her own renunciation, was so intense as to bring tears to his eyes.”But, this is only the premise of the novel. It’s also about sexual desire, the unwavering power of lust and sheer emotional enthralment. However, it’s not about the body as an object of sexual desire; it’s not about the attractiveness, or the unattractiveness, of the female or male form; that’s just meat: it’s about the power of the individual: it’s about the power of an idealistic free spirit. And this is what drew me to the book. The lust in here is freedom. It is the ability to make one’s own life choice and live in harmony with the rest of the world. Labels don’t matter. Restrictions don’t matter. What matters is the freedom to be who you are and what you are. Whether or not this is a vegetarian, homosexual, transgender, a Buddhist Monk or a Christian isn’t overly important. What matters is choice. The vegetarian in here serves as a metaphor, a rallying cry, for a more accepting world. It’s a brutal reminder of the narrowmindedness that infects this planet towards those that fall through the cracks of society.Some readers may see the exploration of mental illness, though what I see is mental illness born of sheer social isolation and spiritual depravation. If a person belongs nowhere, and those that are supposed to be closest to her ignore her, then only maladaptive thinking can occur. Only detrimental cognitive functioning will be born. What “the Vegetarian” needed in here was someone to understand her individuality and to respect it. Instead the coldness she receives sends her own a downward spiral of delusional fantasy, very poetic fantasy.This is a book like no other.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Honestly, in this case, I'm much more interested in reading other people's reviews of the book rather than writing my own. I just feel like there are so many layers here, so many things that need to be discussed, so many unique interpretations, so many questions.The first third of The Vegetarian is very Kafka-esque. It has a very Metamorphosis vibe to it. Maybe a little bit of Bird Box to give you a more contemporary example. It was dark. It was weird. It was bleak. It felt like every sentence belonged there. There wasn't any filler or fluff to bulk up the length. I was all in, too. I was waiting to solve the mystery and figure out what the heck was going on.Then, the second act hits and I realized this book is something completely different than what I expected. I was mildly annoyed at the kind of abrasive shift away from what I wanted the book to be, but once I got over myself and continued to read, I loved the book for completely different reasons. I didn't even know why I liked it really. I kinda felt awkward at times, but then I got over myself again.The third and final act doesn't answer a lot of questions. It actually leaves you with a lot of questions, but not about the story- more about deeper issues like what it is to be human, innocence, and violence. Nothing about not eating animals. Don't let the title fool you. The Vegetarian takes things to a much deeper level than if killing animals is wrong. I barely remember that being discussed.Here's the best way I can break this down for you. Ever watched a good foreign film? You know how in a lot of foreign films there aren't millions of dollars invested into CGI and fhe actors and actresses look like real people? The movie is focused on the dialogue and the story rather than looking and sounding amazing. At the end, you feel something inside and you're thinking, man, I didn't know movies could be like this. I haven't seen anything like this before. That's how The Vegetarian is- translated into English from a South Korean author that doesn't look or feel like any book you've read before. You put it down and you're like, man, I didn't know books could be like this. I haven't read anything like this before.Eat animals or don't. Whatever. But check this one out. It's under 200 pages.

The reason is that I wanted to absorb every word while, in the same time, I had to stop periodically because the emotional loading that my heart accumulated became too much.Korean people are close to my heart as I have been there many times. I believe I understand them more with each visit. The experiences I had there made me feel deeply about this novel. It is tough and not always pleasant to be Korean, the traditions and the society puts pressure on each individual, especially on women, to comply and be responsible.During the conversation I had with various Koreans, I understood there still is the expectation that the woman should follow the men’s orders and to put the well-being of the family above hers, a theme that was present in this novelI read reviews that the book is not realistic… it is wrong. It is very realistic and I can see it happen, including the craze with the vegetarianism.“The feeling that she had never really lived in this world caught her by surprise. It was a fact. She had never lived. Even as a child, as far back as she could remember, she had done nothing but endure. She had believed in her own inherent goodness, her humanity, and lived accordingly, never causing anyone harm. Her devotion to doing things the right way had been unflagging, all her successes had depended on it, and she would have gone on like that indefinitely.

Here you will find what we have come to know, to love and to expect from authors in this genre who write in this vein: the vibrancy, the subtle magical realism, the commanding usage of words and the elusive, sinister nature that is unique to these works—all embedded within an established culture of history and mores that has survived and developed for millennia longer than most others.The Vegetarianread with a delicious ominousness that was as subtle as a shadow, like a breath at your neck. It was that subtly that made the read so taunt and disquieting, and there was a strange, magical realism to it that almost read like Haruki Murakami’s1Q84(no shock there, as they both seem to have been influenced by Kafka). As a work of short literary form (it’s under 200 pages), it was unusual, among other reasons, in that it was told from three different perspectives with almost no perspective from the novel’s subject, Yeong-hye. We see how her vegetarianism, which later leads into a kind of manic catatonia, affects first her callous and at times sexually abusive husband, then her brother-in-law who becomes completely enthralled with her sexually because of her Mongolian mark, and her sister who is the last one standing when Yeong-hye’s psyche begins to peel away.In addition to the serious topics thatThe Vegetarianbrushed up against: the effect of cultural mores on women, body image, conformism, familial ties and abuse, and, of course, mental illness that ultimately culminated in a way that I could never reveal without spoiling it for you—this was also a tale of family dysfunction. It was a tale of familial ties that were severed painfully, of violent confrontations and realizations, of physical and emotional starvation, and a parable about the woman, the vegetarian, at the center of it all.The Vegetarianwas sensual, and it meandered toward its climax in a way that was both unsettling and prophetic. It was allegory elevated to the highest level of art, raised to the level of surrealism. Honestly, this may or may not work for everyone. You have to suspend your past experiences with reading (outside of this genre) in order to enjoy this one. That much is, honestly, a must. The change in tenses and POVs worked well. And even this technique, this simple process of sentence writing that we learn in grade school, was elevated: the tenses of sentences shifted noticeably, particularly the closer that it came to dénouement, a jolting but brilliant allusion to this descent into mental illness and personal violence, which added to the mystical element of this novel.Han Kang produced a work, her first to be seen here in the U.S., that was so unhinged, so mystifying, that at times it would slither from your grasp. I had to sit and reflect on several of the passages for a few minutes—not because they were ill-written, but because they were both profound and often just outside of my immediate mental grasp, and that was a wonderful thing. It was an effect that I look for in modern-day writing—that disquietingly ungraspable moment.Yeong-hye’s voice, which came to her while she was suspended in that halfway state between sleep and wakefulness, was low and warm at first, then innocent like that of a young child, but the last part was mangled, a distorted animal sound. Her eyes snapped open in fright, and she was stung by a waking hatred the likes of which she’d never felt before, before being thrown back into sleep. This time she was standing in from of the bathroom mirror. In the reflection, blood was trickling from her left eye. She quickly reached up to wipe the blood away, but somehow her reflection in the mirror didn’t move an inch, only stood there, blood running from a staring eye.The Vegetarianwas unconventional. It broke away from the molds that we find ourselves encumbered in with typical fiction. Here you will not find the typical “rising action, climax, falling action” formula that we’ve become so accustomed to, that we’ve grown to expect and to lean into, though we know how it’ll all end in the end. There may or may not have been some issues with translation, but if there were, it wasn't overtly noticeable to me. I found the translation obstacles, where applicable, to be mild at worst. I would recommend this read to anyone who's ready to move away from the conventional, and to anyone already familiar or ready to become familiar with this genre of writing. Honestly, this read left me a little speechless, so you’ll have to excuse the less-than-customary word count here. Definitely, take that as a compliment in the highest sense. 5 stars. *****FOLLOW ME HERE:Goodreads|Twitter|Instagram|Get a Copy of My Book|Book Editing, Author Coaching, Submit Your Book to Me""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“It’s your body, you can treat it however you please. The only area where you’re free to do just as you like. And even that doesn’t turn out how you wanted.”I don’t even know how to begin describing this novel. I’m guessing that in a year’s time or more, it will still hold true that this was one of the most haunting, unsettling and tragic novels I’ve read in a long time. For a slim book, there’s a great deal to mull over and discuss. There are many different ways of looking at this besides what meets the eye. Don’t let the title fool you. This isn’t simply a book about a woman that renounces meat and animal by-products. It’s a story about autonomy over one’s body and one’s life and the repercussions of a lack thereof. It probes the harmful ramifications of patriarchal societies, violence, and victimization. It explores mental illness. I’m not even touching on everything here. This is some heavy stuff!“Everything starts to feel unfamiliar. As if I’ve come up to the back of something. Shut up behind a door without a handle. Perhaps I’m only now coming face-to-face with the thing that has always been here. It’s dark. Everything is being snuffed out in the pitch-black darkness.”The subject of this novel is Yeong-hye. She’s not actually given a voice here except for a few very brief passages, as in the quote above, when she recounts the nightmares that led her to turn to vegetarianism. Instead, the book is split into three parts giving the perspectives of her husband, her brother-in-law, and eventually her sister. Not for one second did I ever feel any sympathy for the men. That’s not to say that I wasn’t wholly absorbed by the first two sections, because I surely was. What ultimately made the story for me, however, was the last section when we heard from In-hye, the sister. This was truly poignant and thought provoking. What makes one person suffer from mental illness while another does not? I’ve often considered that the boundary between a diagnosed illness versus a non-diagnosis can be a bit blurred at times. What about responsibility to another – how does that affect us psychologically? How do we protect those we love?“If it hadn’t been for Ji-woo—if it hadn’t been for the sense of responsibility she felt toward him—perhaps she too might have relinquished her grip on that thread.”I ended up with more questions by the time I turned the last page. I’ve had experience with a close loved one with a mental illness. As a child it’s scary and disconcerting. For me personally it heavily influenced my development as an adolescent and young adult. It affected many of my choices. I often think about the effects of mental illness on the functioning of a family. Han Kang has made me think about it that much more. What a powerful, beautiful torment of a book this was.“Life is such a strange thing… Even after certain things have happened to them, no matter how awful the experience, people still go on eating and drinking, going to the toilet and washing themselves - living, in other words. And sometimes they even laugh out loud.”'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Update: Han Kang\'s book, ""The Vegetarian"", is the Man Booker international winnerWow...********ZERO spoilersI\'m going to share my experience....and hope to find other readers to discuss this book with later.I couldn\'t \'not\' read this in anything less than one sitting.If I keep thinking about this book, not only will I have a knot in my stomach as I do now...but I just might find myself crying my eyes out!I haven\'t felt so many intense emotions from a book in a long time.Zillions of thoughts flooded my mind from when our daughter was anorexic.

At least until she decides to stop eating meat. Told in a darkly poetic prose strong enough to hold a host of horrors, Kang cuts through the masks of society until ‘familiarity bleeds into strangeness, certainty becomes impossible’ in order for her to take critical aim at forces of violence and control. Sharp, sinister and surreal,The Vegetarianis a powerful tale of the aggressions aimed at those who step outside the social norms and the misogynistic assumptions that impose subservience and suppression and it makes for a truly unforgettable read.‘It’s your body, you can treat it however you please. The only area where you’re free to do just as you like. And even that doesn’t turn out how you wanted.’Originally published in South Korea as three novellas,The Vegetariansthree sections, each from the voice of a different character, stitches the perspectives of family in orbit around the story of Yeong-hye. We begin with her husband, Mr. Cheong, who enjoyed her being ‘completely unremarkable in every way,’ and because ‘it was rare for her to demand anything of me’ making her suited to be the quiet, submissive wife he desires. Her choosing to refrain from eating meat is an annoyance to him, but his real frustration is her desire to attain bodily autonomy as he believes ‘it was nothing but sheer obstinacy for a wife to go against her husband's wishes.’ We move to her brother-in-law as he uses his art to seduce her but, like Mr. Cheong, becomes angry when her actions are less in submission to his sexual hunger but instead enacted as a way to perform her body in a way she desires. Finally we have her sister who is haunted by Yeong-hye’s refusal to eat but beings to understand it as an act of resistance.Kang orchestrates these characters in a sort of destructive dance where we find them rather inscrutable to one another. Or often to themselves.There is a certain sorrow to discover those closest elude decoding or have interior lives we cannot decode, such as In-hye’s revelations after divorcing her husband:‘Had she ever really understood her husband’s true nature, bound up as it was with that seemingly impenetrable silence? She’d thought, at one time, that it might be revealed in his work…Despite her best efforts, though, his works proved incomprehensible to her. Nothing was revealed.’The incomprehensibility becomes a clever theme on how our best efforts to understand each other often amounts to placing the personality of others into a box of faulty assumptions and then becoming upset when they act off script of our presumptions. It shines a spotlight on the assumption of control one might impose upon others, a control that becomes harshly oppressive when it is enabled by misogynistic gender roles and feels threatened by any resistance to it.Which is what Kang executes so brilliantly here by denying Yeong-hye a voice similarly to how it has been suppressed by those around her and she must have her own thoughts decentered from her own story to instead have it told through the flawed assumptions of others who can’t truly comprehend her, or, such as the men narrating the first two sections, could never begin to understand what it is like to live as a woman denied any sense of self-agency.‘She had never lived. Even as a child, as far back as she could remember, she had done nothing but endure.’Yeong-hye, ‘a woman of few words,’ represents the push and pull between the desire for an authentic, autonomous self and the socially imposed role of a subordinate, familial self. Haunted by horrific dreams of meat and violence, she decides to be a vegetarian as a refusal to be a part of the violence all around. In this way she views plant life as a sort of innocence and her draw to the brother-in-law is only mistaken as sexual when in actuality she enjoys the flowers he paints on her naked body as symbolic of becoming innocence or, better yet, being able tochooseto be painted as a symbol. But her actions are met with the consequences of societal disdain, reflected in her husband's anger and the family attempting to force her to eat meat.‘The very idea that there should be this other side to her, one where she selfishly did as she pleased, was astonishing. Who would have thought she could be so unreasonable.’The idea that she could have a sense of agency is outright offensive to those around her. ‘Look at yourself, now! Stop eating meat, and the world will devour you whole.’ Even in her attempts to not eat entirely, she is held into a hospital bed with a feeding tube shoved into her nose. The message is clear: you cannot have autonomy. The novel steers us through episodes of social enforcement of norms, with Kang emphasizing the violence society tolerates in order to uphold its narrow values.‘In-hye stares fiercely at the trees. As if waiting for an answer. As if protesting against something.’Kang’sThe Vegetarianis situated in a South Korean society that has grappled with issues glaring issues of oppression against women, one that has onlycontinued to be exacerbatedin the years since the novel was first published in 2007. Kang takes aim atissues of misogynyin South Korea such asviolence against womenwith South Korean being amongst thetop 3 highest rates of women as homicide victims in the worlddespite a generally low homicide rate, gender inequality problems such as havingthe worst gender pay gap amongst OECD countries, and until 2013 marital rape wasnot a criminal act(such as is seen in the novel). While Yeong-hye’s actions are seen as outrageous to others, Kang depicts her and her role in life in such a way that one can certainly see that her refusal to submit ‘as if boundaries and limitations didn’t mean anything for her’ may be the only reasonable actions in the story.‘She was no longer able to cope with all that her sister reminded her of. She’d been unable to forgive her for soaring alone over a boundary she herself could never bring herself to cross, unable to forgive that magnificent irresponsibility that had enabled Yeong-hye to shuck off social constraints and leave her behind, still a prisoner. And before Yeong-hye had broken those bars, she’d never even known they were there.’While the novel may have raised controversy with its subject matter, Deborah Smith’s translation into English raised more controversy. Soon after winning the Booker International, Smith’s English translation began to receive harsh criticism in Korean literary communities and presses, stirring a bit ofcontroversy with opinions on either sidewith one critic stating the book was ‘so different that it was more reasonable to speak of Smith’s work as an adaptation, not a translation.’ Smith has defended her artistic choices and while she admits ‘there's plenty to criticize in my translation,’ she stands by it and says her aim was to capture the spirit over one-to-one translation. ‘Translators feel a great responsibility to the original text,’ sheexplained in the press, ‘I would only permit myself an infidelity for the sake of a greater fidelity.’ Readers can decide for themselves and, personally, I’m a huge fan of translated works because it allows for a greater global community around literature that I—and many others—couldn’t read otherwise. Inan essay forLA Review of Books, Deborah Smith voiced concerns that the criticisms of her work and Kang’s original seemed to be a method of distracting from its message:‘It’s not difficult to see why a book that exposes this pervasive structural violence might have been received differently by the (mostly older male) literary establishment than by the many Korean women who didn’t consider it “extreme and bizarre” at all. Perhaps the overwhelming focus on The Vegetarian’s aesthetics is a way of avoiding talking about its politics?’Personally, I quite enjoyed the read though I have no way to know accuracy, and Han Kang has defended Smith’s choices and has continued to have her works translated by Smith. ‘What makes me worry,’ Smith expresses, ‘is when the desire to prove a particular argument about a translation encourages a misleading view of the original — in this case, overlooking the poetry I and many others see in Han's writing.’ There is indeed a beautiful poetry here, even in all the darkness and violence of the text. ‘Translating from Korean into English involves moving from a language more accommodating of ambiguity, repetition, and plain prose, to one that favors precision, concision, and lyricism,’ she continues, ‘this is simultaneously a gross generalization and an observable phenomenon.’ I will remain grateful for translators everywhere who are able to bring us such excellent stories from around the globe. Stories that have left such an impact their author now can be celebrated as a Nobel Prize recipient.This powerful, unsettling, often Kafkaesque, and societally damning tale makes for an excellent read and shocking reminder of the oppressions women face the world over.

On 10 October 2024, Han Kang was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature for her “intense poetic prose that confronts historical traumas and exposes the fragility of human life”.How to review this cold, voyeuristic, sexy, ugly, beautiful, disturbing novella?The single story is told in three sections, from three points of view - in three different genres: from a domestic drama of a marriage suddenly under strain, through erotica, to madness and borderline magical-realism. But we never hear from the subject herself.At the end… I felt adrift, rather than rooted. Intrigued, moved, and pleasantly bemused.Triggers: This book is probably unusable for those in the depths of eating disorders, body dysmorphia, or suicidal ideation. It’s not really about vegetarianism.1. The VegetarianIt starts simply: Yeong-hye is a young South Korean woman. She has been married for a few years to Mr Cheong, who narrates the first part. He is very aware of her ordinariness; it’s part of what made her suitable.“If there wasn’t any special attraction, nor did any particular drawbacks present themselves, and therefore there was no reason for the two of us not to get married.”When Yeong-hye has her first vivid and disturbing dream about butchered animals, she becomes a vegetarian.Image:Abattoir(Source.)“I ate too much meat. The lives of the animals I ate have all lodged there.” [on her chest]This change is shocking and disgusting to Mr Cheong, shameful in front of his colleagues, and anathema to her traditional family. Conformity is required, individualism reviled.The nearest Mr Cheong comes to demonstrating any passion is when he describes, in almost fetishistic terms, how delicious his wife\'s meat-based cooking used to be. Yeong-hye may be becoming anorexic or delusional, but he shows neither sympathy nor curiosity - just anger and resentment at the effect on him.2. Mongolian Mark(AMongolian markis a type of grey birth mark at the base of the spine, that usually disappears by age 5 and almost always before puberty.)The middle section opens at a dance show with an ox-blood coloured curtain.“The carnality, the pure sensuality of this image, was nothing short of monstrous.”It focuses on the unnamed husband of Yeong-hye’s sister. He’s an unsuccessful video artist, emasculated by his wife’s success: “their only shared business was their child”.His dramatic inspiration for a new artwork is personal, passionate, and transgressive. The story transmogrifies into artistic erotica, with undertones of paedophilic desires.Image:“Magnolia”, by Cecilia Paredes(Source.)“The monochrome world, entirely devoid of the colours he was now experiencing, had had a calmness that was beautiful in its way… All of his energy was taken up in trying to cope with the excitement, the heightened awareness of living in the present moment.”3. Flaming Trees“She had merely absorbed all her suffering inside her.”The final section, narrated by In-hye (Yeong-hye’s older sister), mostly in the present tense, is a darker exploration of change, humanity, family ties, duty, and madness.“Soon now, words and thoughts will disappear.”Is she like Kafka\'sThe Hunger Artist(see my reviewHERE) or more like the girl in one of the stories in Daisy Johnson\'sFen(see my reviewHERE)?Image:Woman doing handstand in a forest.(Source.)Men versus sisters“Hand, foot, tongue, gaze, all weapons from which nothing is safe.”This felt like a book written by a man until part way into the middle section. I think that’s because it was told by/from male points of view, one of them judgemental, controlling, and cold, and both objectifying women.“It was a body that made one want to rest one’s gaze quietly upon it.”The final section by In-hye was different. Although the story is ostensibly about Yeong-hye, the relationship between the sisters is at the heart of it all.•\tOne is serene, self-contained, and possibly brave:“She radiated energy, like a tree that grows in the wilderness, denuded and solitary.”•\tThe other is successful, dutiful, conventional:“The kind of woman whose goodness is oppressive”.Both have deep inner strength, and they are tied by blood and by the shared suffix of their names (whereas the men are Mr Cheong and... who knows what In-hye\'s husband is called?).•\tHow much does one owe family - and what happens when there are conflicting needs?•\tWhat’s the toll of guilt, betrayal, and jealousy?•\tTo what extent can one break free of genes and expectations, and at what cost?ImageryThe dreams, described in short italic passages, involve blood, flesh, and eyes.Blood and eyes recur throughout.As do breasts, birds, and trees.I felt there was more to these symbols than the obvious, but I\'m not sure what.Quotes•\t“The kiss was a palimpsest of memories.”•\t“Dreams overlaid with dreams, a palimpsest of horror.”•\t“With my round breasts, I’m okay… So why do they keep on shrinking?...

Tragic.•\t“As if there were a wire linking her tongue with his body, every time that little pink tongue darted out [licking shaved ice] he found himself flinching as though from an electric shock.”•\t“This was the body of a beautiful young woman… yet it was a body from which all the desire had been eliminated…. What she had renounced was the very life that her body represented. The sunlight that came splintering through the wide window… and the beauty of that body… was also ceaselessly splintering.”•\t“Her calm acceptance… made her seem to him something sacred. Whether human, animal or plant, she could not be called a ‘person’.”•\t“The brush was cold, and the sensation was ticklish yet numbing, a persistent, effectual caress.”•\t“She’d been unable to forgive her for soaring alone over a boundary she herself could never bring herself to cross,”•\t“She had never lived… she had done nothing but endure… Her life was no more than a ghostly pageant of exhausted endurance, no more real than a television drama.”•\t“Her voice had no weight… neither gloomy nor absent-minded… the quiet tone of someone who didn’t belong anywhere, someone who had passed into a border area between states of being.”Image:“Her bare feet kissing the tiles.”(Source.)Notes about the original Korean novellaThe three parts were originally published separately. I think a slightly firmer delineation of the parts is probably helpful. The disconcerting and dramatic change of viewpoint and genre is part of the appeal, and what makes this so unusual.There\'s also controversy about the English translation, as highlighted in Nocturnalux \'s comment below, and discussed in knowledgeable detail, with links to other articles, in the comments ofPaul\'s review.Is the English version I read barely recognisable version of the original, or are the criticisms themselves rooted in racist stereotypes?Another good article, courtesy ofChinook\'s reviewisthis one. It picks out specific examples of clearcut ""mistakes"". But it concludes:""And ultimately, Smith carried out perhaps the most important task of all: She successfully introduced a work of literature to people who might otherwise never have had a chance to read it. In that regard, Smith was faithful to the end.""I\'m glad I was able to read it.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '[Edited and spoiler hidden 10/12/24 when I read that the author won the 2024 Nobel Prize for Literature]The author makes a point of starting the story by telling us it’s about an ordinary Korean couple. The man, recognizing that he is nothing special, marries a woman whom he calls “the most run-of-the-mill woman in the world.”The young woman, living in Seoul, starts having nightmares full of blood and hanging meat. She decides to become a vegetarian. Her husband is irate and even recruits her family to help him get her to start eating and cooking meat again.That pressure and the continuing nightmares push her further toward an almost plant-like existence. She takes her clothes off to get sun and runs into the forest and stands in the rain lie a tree. She hardly sleeps; she becomes anorexic and skeletal. She suffers abuse.By her brother-in-law, a video artist who sexually exploits her.We learn about her abusive father, and maybe some of her issues had roots in that abuse.There is good writing, such as this passage about her brother-in-law:“…even after they were married he still looked perpetually worn out. He was always busy with his own things, and during what little time he did spend at home he looked more like a traveler putting up there for a night than a man in his own home. His silence had the heavy mass of rock and the tenacious resistance of rubber, particularly when his art wasn’t going well.The author (b. 1970) has written more than 20 books of which a half-dozen appear to have been translated into English. This book, The Vegetarian, won the 2016 Man Booker prize for translated novels. It was also picked as one of the 10 Best Books of 2016 by the NY Times Book Review. I also enjoyed reading her The White Book, mostly poems, which was shortlisted for the 2018 Man Booker prize.Photo of Seoul from beltandroad.newsThe author from nytimes.com'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Han Kang's novel, 'The Vegetarian,' tells the story of Yeong-hye. Having recently had a dream that has convinced her to cease eating any meat whatsoever, and finds that such a decision is affect nearly all aspects of her life. Her family is trying to force her to eat meat, the relationships that once surrounded her are falling apart, and everyone is questioning whether she is insane. The thing is, she just might be losing her mind - and all because of a dream.This book isn't super long. In fact, it reads like a novella, so it's easy to consume and fast paced enough that about the time you feel really into it, it's over. It's not a bad thing though because there is a LOT packed into this little story. Despite being a story that is explicitly about Yeong-hye, it is actually never told directly from her perspective. Instead, we are give about 60 pages a piece from her husband, her brother-in-law, and her sister. The oddest part about this formatting is, unlike many book of this type, the perspectives do not overlap. Some take place at the time of Yeong-hye's decision to become a vegetarian, and others take place years after the fact.To be totally honest, this book is weird. It might actually be the weirdest book I've ever read. But there's still something beautiful about it. It's an honest look at mental illness and how it affects not only that individual, but also everyone that cares about them. For those who have dealt with abuse, it's not as cut and dry to understand why mental illness affects them. Instead, it's about learning how to cope and manage, but also when to let go of those who hold you back.As I mentioned before, this book is a roller coaster ride, especially in the beginning. I sat down to read this expecting to read for maybe 20 minutes later but looked at the clock an hour later and realized that I was so involved in the story that I didn't want to stop reading. It's sad, depressing, at times fun, but most of all it's probably the most thought-provoking novel I have ever read.My rating:I give it 3 stars not because I didn't like it or I don't think you should read it, but because I found the pacing of the book to be distracting. It starts off energetic, fast-paced, and almost manic. During the middle, it takes a turn and reads more as a desperate plea for approval or attention. And in the end, it's detailed, slower, and tired. I don't know whether this was an intentional decision, but for me as a reader it meant that every 60 pages or so I was forced to feel like I was adjusting to a new writing style.Who should read it?:If you enjoy international novels, this is an excellent choice. I have been told that those who have been deeply affected by the decision to become a vegetarian have loved this story. Or anyone who wants to read something that is so unlike anything else out there, that there is no way they will forget this book.I was provided with a free copy of this book in order to conduct this review.WEBSITE|TWITTER|FACEBOOK|INSTAGRAM""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '- اولاً لا بد من الإشادة بلغة محمود عبد الغفار الرائعة في الترجمة، لولا بعض الاخطاء الإملائية والنحوية البسيطة.- اعتقد اولاً اننا لا يمكننا قراءة هذه الرواية بالسببية، بمعنى ما السبب الذي جعلها نباتية، لأن هذا غير مهم اطلاقاً، فتحولها الى نباتية هو موقف تجسّد بالإمتناع عن اكل اللحوم!- الدافع في هذه الرواية هو الخوف، فهذه الفتاة التي عاشت في كنف اهل غير متفهمين، وكانت تتحمل الضرب، وتزوجت بإنسان تافه كانت خادمته لخمس سنوات، هذه المخلوقة الضعيفة راكمت الخوف فوق الخوف، والإنعزال فوق الإنعزال والخضوع والدونية حتى ضاقت نفسها بجسدها فبدأ الحلم وبدأت محاولات التخلص منه بالإمتناع عن اللحوم!- القصة تنقسم لثلاثة اقسام، الجزء الاول والأخير يشكلان البداية والنهاية، ورغم سلاستهما الا انهما لا يقارنان بإبداع الجزء الثاني- يتدرج الجزء الأول من زواج، فحياة رتيبة (5 سنوات) ثم الحلم، فالتحول لنباتية ورمي اللحوم و""إحراج"" الزوج في المناسبات، فشكواه لأهلها، فمحاولة اهلها اجبارها على اللحم فالضرب فمحاولة الانتحار... ويبدأ الجزء الثالث بنقلها لمصحة الأمراض النفسية، فعلاجها فإمتناعها عن العلاج الى اضمحلالها واقترابها مما تهوى الا وهو الموت والتوحد مع الطبيعة.. هذا الجزء (الثالث) اتى على لسان الأخت الكبرى التي ربطت فقرات الرواية ببعضها معطية الأبعاد النفسية للنصوص التي مرّت، بإنتقال سلس ما بين الماضي (فلاش باك) والحاضر وصولاً الى المستقبل في آخر سطور الرواية.- الجزء الثاني، إبداع رائع، دمج التصوير والرسم والإيروتيك اتى بتناغم ما بعده تناغم، فالبناء الهائل حول مصدر الهام ""تافه"" او عادي كالبقعة المنغولية اتى بشكل لا يوصف، كما ان الوصف الذي تقلّب بين فن بحت، الى فن ورغبة، الى رغبة وانتهاء بالجنس من اجل الفن كان بديعاً. وعلى الضفة الأخرى فإن وجود الأخت الصغرى في قلب الحدث شحن هذا الجزء بأبعادٍ اخلاقية ونفسية كثيرة. كما ان الكاتبة وبطريقة غير مباشرة لم تجعل من هذا الحدث سبباً لإنهيار الأخت الصغرى بل كان الشيئ الوحيد الذي فعلته بإرادتها منذ بداية الرواية الى آخرها، كان قرارها.. رغم ما سببه من انهيار العالم حول اختها الكبرى!- ""هل الموت امر سيئ"" سؤال سألته الأخت الصغرى في النهاية، ويبدو انه كان الهدف المنشود....'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'The Vegetarian is a short, sad, and simple read that still managed to leave an impression on me.

Han Kang does a great job portraying how women suffer from the male gaze, patriarchal standards that make them adhere to men, and abuse brought on by the forced consumption of meat and the men who partake in said consumption. As a future psychologist passionate about eating disorders, though, I abhorred how Kang portrayed Yeong-hye\'s descent into anorexia. Yes, I get that her refusal to eat meat and then food overall symbolizes her rejection of the normative, sexist values of her surrounding society and family. But Kang glorified this restrictive behavior too much. Others have described this book as ""beautiful"" and ""fresh"" and ""delicious.""This book is literally about a woman who slowly kills herself through self-starvation.There is nothing pretty or romantic or healthy about this novel. I would not want anyone to model their actions after Yeong-hye, and I wish Kang had driven home that point more.Overall, a good depiction of a woman who suffers because of the violence men inflict upon her.

My reaction is somewhat inappropriate, both with regards to my setting and to the fact that this book takes a turn that is NO LAUGHING MATTER! Before buying a coffee-to-go on my first train ride of the day, I already choke on my own laughter, realising that the first of the different narrators is one of the most selfish, uncaring, brutal male prototypes imaginable, and the story is developed from his point of view, which is a magnificent stylistic feature.10 o\'clock, crammed local train moving into the conservative countryside:While I read about an atrocious case of physical abuse in the name of patriarchal power, leading to mental breakdown as well as family dissolution, shivering at the passive fictional bystanders watching the violence in voyeuristic fascination, the train prepares for its final station and a group of Asian tourists are lining up in the corridor to leave the train. An elderly Bavarian man tells his wife and grandchild that there is no use getting off their seats as long as (enter derogatory word for Japanese in German which I still am too angry to repeat) are clogging the train. Fuelled by the effect of patriarchal superiority complex I read about just a second earlier, and by the fact that the Asian setting of the novel makes it somehow closer to the situation I am experiencing in real life, I literally see red and turn to the old man, just a casual racist as there are legion everywhere, and ask him if he is aware that all people have the same right to this train? He mumbles something, trying to explain that it is a fact though. They are standing there. Yes, it is a fact that people are standing in the train, trying to leave. Only a racist makes a derogatory remark on their origin (which, by the way, doesn\'t have to be Japanese at all, just because he thinks so). That is how patriarchy and racism work, and I was shaking when I left the train, as much because of the conflict I had had myself, as because of the enhancing effect of the brutal novel on my fragile equilibrium.12 o\'clock in a local village, without cash:While the story evolves into a case of mental disease and a rare form of anorexia nervosa, I start to feel like I am starving myself.

I feel slightly uncomfortable to read the book in a public space now, hoping not to draw any attention to myself. It is intense reading. No quotes.17 o\'clock at an airport, waiting, I have food and water and a spot to myself, locked away in the security area:And that is a good thing, because now the story moves between dream and reality, between now and childhood trauma, between guilt and shame. How can you possibly be a woman in a world dominated by male rules and male violence? In a hospital for mental health, the vegetarian tries to change into a plant in order to escape the carnal pain that has defined her life from the beginning. And in her sister, she plants a seed of doubt. What if she is not the strong one, after all?

The novel is simply told, and very short, but it touches on so many critical, cut-to-the-bone themes, including the most fundamental questions of identity, of gender, of responsibility toward others, and of what makes life worth living. In this novel the more outwardly stable and successful a character is, the less likely they are to have any perspective on their life choices. The more a given character becomes aware of their lived experience, the closer he or she comes to falling into the abyss. The story forces characters, and by extension readers, to think deeply about what ""self"" is, whether it be defined most simply as an organic body with organic desires and needs of its own, or as part of a social structure, where one\'s value and even one\'s sanity is defined by others. This was a disturbing read in the best sense possible--I was disturbed from complacent thinking and stirred up with new thoughts.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'In my country, compared to the vast expanse dedicated to Japanese literature in bookstores, the space allocated to Korean literature is pitifully small. Moreover, translations of serious literary works are scarce, making it difficult to understand Korean society through such works. So, my impression of Korea is largely shaped by the various exaggerations and melodramatic plots of Korean dramas. It\'s said that over 80% of Korean drama writers are housewives who, with nothing better to do, write gossip and daydreams to earn some extra money, clearly indicating a rather perfunctory approach to writing.As a professional writer and a professor of creative writing at Seoul Arts University, Han Kang, however, takes her writing seriously: her psychological descriptions are extremely delicate, showcasing the strengths of a female writer; and her writing perspective is unique.I believe thatThe Vegetarian, won the Nobel in large part due to her choice of using”changes in diet""to reflect”changes in the human psyche."" “Vegetarianism""is a symbol, a form of escape, a rebellion against the”carnivorous age.""Using”eating,""such as a basic act of survival, as a starting point, not only makes it easy for readers to identify with and empathize with, but also creates a strong tension with the”mental disorder""reflected in the novel, resulting in a more shocking effect, even to the point of being horrifying.In my opinion, this book is all about the deep despair that modern people feel. As to the reasons for this despair, they may vary from person to person: perhaps it\'s the sense of powerlessness brought by the pressure of survival, perhaps it\'s the strong constraints of the workplace, perhaps it\'s the torment of family conflicts, or perhaps, like Young-hye, it comes from the brutality of her father in childhood, the indifference of her husband after marriage, and the intolerance of traditional concepts. These reasons accumulate day by day, and we may not even notice that we have fallen into despair one day. Just like Young-hye, after experiencing countless nightmares, one day at 4 a.m., she stood motionless in front of the refrigerator. She threw away all the meat in the house and became a complete vegetarian from then on.Young-hye\'s husband doesn\'t understand why a woman who was so unremarkable in appearance and behavior, and therefore so reassuring, would suddenly become so different.I didn\'t understand at first either.While the novel describes Young-hye\'s terrifying dreams - lost in a deep, dark forest, entering a hut hung with hundreds of large, blood-red chunks of meat, chewing raw flesh, and seeing her own ferocious face reflected in a pool of blood - it doesn\'t elaborate on the psychological process that led to her change. However, as the plot unfolds, we can see from her husband\'s attitude towards her - misunderstanding, disdain, and eventually abandoning her - and from the reactions of Young-hye\'s parents and family - forcing her to eat meat, beating her, and forcing her to commit suicide - that Young-hye is an incredibly lonely person. She is a representative of modern people who are bound by life: repressed desires, hidden childhood traumas, the huge gap between the closest people created by selfishness and indifference, and the deep sadness that cannot be expressed. All of these have created a huge black hole in the bodies of modern people, creating a rootless soul without love.However, becoming a vegetarian and staying away from meat did not bring peace to Young-hye\'s heart. On the one hand, the guilt she felt from her childhood, when her pet dog, was bitten by a dog and her father tied the dog to a motorcycle and ran it to death, and the whole family ate the dog meat, could never be erased; on the other hand, the repressed desires under the loneliness had nowhere to vent. In modern society, behind the feigned strangeness between people, there is a strong desire for communication and exchange. Young-hye likes to take off her clothes in public and expose her body. She is fascinated by the vivid flowers and vines that her brother-in-law paints on her naked body. These desires displayed on the body have nothing to do with the physical body, but represent a strong spiritual yearning. Due to the lack of true love and understanding, we are all ""patients"" and ""mentally ill"" in modern society, facing more and more psychological problems. Often, we not only don\'t understand others, but we also don\'t understand ourselves, cutting off the possibility of communication with others. Young-hye\'s parents love her, but they first beg her to eat meat, and then violently force her to eat meat; Young-hye\'s sister loves her, but she cannot accept her covered in flowers, naked, and together with her own husband, so she sent her to a mental hospital.In the mental institution, Young-hye yearns to become a tree, hoping to root her soul like a tree. She stands on her head for a long time, trying to burrow deep into the earth; she begins to fast, believing that she only needs sunlight to exist. She struggles desperately, coughs up large amounts of blood, and is on the verge of death. From someone who yearns to break free from the shackles of life, she truly becomes a patient, a person about to leave this world. How much repression and helplessness can create such extreme despair? How can it make her want to escape her human body and find true liberation in death? It\'s so shocking, yet so bleak.The reason I say that Young-hye embodies the universal repression and despair of modern people is that these characteristics are also evident in the novel\'s other two protagonists. Young-hye\'s brother-in-law is a visual artist who has lost his creative passion. He does not love his wife, finds marriage boring and oppressive, and lacks the proper sense of responsibility for his children. The only thing that can arouse his passion is hearing that his sister-in-law has a birthmark on her buttocks. To see this birthmark, he deceives his sister-in-law into doing body painting, but unintentionally creates real art. He is immersed in the primitive desire aroused by the birthmark and the flowers, which becomes the only meaning of his life.Young-hye\'s sister, In-hye, is a traditional strong woman. She runs a cosmetics store, supports the whole family, supports her artistic husband, and diligently raises her son, acting as the most capable eldest daughter in front of her parents. She thought she loved her husband, but found that her husband had long lost interest in her and the family, and had an affair with her own sister; she thought she loved her sister, but found that it was her repeated coldness and coercion that led to her sister\'s lifelessness; she thought she loved her son, but tried to commit suicide, leaving her 6-year-old son to live alone in the world. She is not even as lucky as her sister, unable to become a tree. When she held a rope and thought of ending her life on the mountain, she found that ""there was no tree willing to take her in."" So she discovered that living is a very strange thing... After experiencing some things, after experiencing all kinds of unbearable disasters, people can still eat, drink, sleep, and defecate, and they can even laugh heartily. When I realized that I was living like this too, the pity that I had forgotten was slowly awakened like sleep.Young-hye\'s ending cannot be entirely attributed to modern society and others; her own weakness is also an important reason. In-hye\'s fate is different from Young-hye\'s. She tries to save herself from this ""modern despair,"" but where does the strength come from? If it is said that In-hye did not commit suicide simply because she had a responsibility to her child and because she regarded the past as ""just a dream,"" it would not be convincing enough. How to overcome the weakness of modern people, how to place salvation in the future? The author does not give a clear answer.What will happen ""then""? Are those self-suppressions real? Can we find the courage to continue living?4.3 / 5 stars'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""Rechazando la carne, mi protagonista rechaza la violencia del ser humano"" con esta frase que la autora contesta en una entrevista que también recoge la novela, se puede resumir bastante bien de lo que trata este libro. Aunque es mucho, muchísimo más. Es una novela enorme en mayúsculas.Nos vamos a encontrar con Yeonghye un mujer que de pronto decide dejar de comer carne. Curiosamente la autora decide contarnos la historia de Yeonghye a través de tres narradores diferentes, su marido, su cuñado y su hermana. Y, extrañamente, conseguí empatizar con la protagonista a un nivel, que me extraña muchísimo haberlo conseguido sin escuchar sus propios pensamientos.Como digo este libro es enorme y bajo la trama de una chica que decide dejar de comer carne, se esconde mucho más. Es una crítica a la sociedad y no creo que solo se centre en la surcoreana, se puede extrapolar al resto del mundo, porque en mayor o menor medida, es algo que se repite en todos los países. Como digo, es una crítica a esta sociedad donde no se puede destacar, donde si algo se sale de la norma se señala, se castiga. Una sociedad donde alguien no puede dejar de comer carne sin que el mundo de su alrededor opine. La mayoría de los personajes le repiten constantemente que sin la carne no tendrá vitalidad, y, curiosamente, ningún personaje irradia energía, más bien todo lo contrario. Se mueven casi por inercia. Y además, salvo su hermana al final, a ningún personaje parece que le mueva la preocupación real por la salud de la protagonista, si no el mero hecho de que no destaque, de que algo diferente que no entienden, no les incomode o perturbe su vida. Por ejemplo, su marido, lo único que opina sobre ella es que ha cambiado y ya no le resulta tan cómoda la convivencia con ella.Y, por supuesto, una vez más, la peor parte se la lleva la mujer. Curiosamente el único personaje que logra entenderla al final, si no bien en su totalidad, si empatizar con ella, es su hermana. Otra mujer que ha pasado por esa misma violencia con la que la sociedad liderada por hombres oprime a las mujeres. Existen muchas citas donde su marido habla de ella como una persona a la que escogió por ""simple"", por no destacar o por no tener nada especial. Y que eso le gustaba de ella, que estuviera callada y no diera problemas. De hecho, curiosamente, jamás la llama por su nombre, solo la nombra como ""mi mujer"" o ""ella"", como si fuera una más de sus posesiones. O su cuñado, que solo la ve como un elemento para conseguir satisfacer sus deseos. Así, es su hermana Inhye el único personaje que realmente trata de entenderla y consigue ponerse en sintonía con ella de alguna manera.La novela tiene un prólogo y una nota posterior de la traductora super interesantes, donde nos cuenta que la novela en Corea inicialmente fue muy críticada y no gustó a los críticos, y que estos, obviamente, eran predominantemente hombres. De hecho a las mujeres solía gustarles la novela, mientras que los hombres no lograban entenderla. Vaya vaya. La historia de siempre.Por otra parte, mientras leí la novela tenía un sentimiento rarísimo que pocas veces he experimentado leyendo un libro. Muy pocas. Y no lograba identificarlo hasta que lo acabé. Era incomodidad, el libro te hace sentir oprimido. Es tan perturbador, tan crudo y realista, que te pone los pelos de punta cada página.Aconsejaría a todo el mundo que leyera este libro con ganas y analizando cada frase sin quedarse en la superficialidad del tema inicial, para lograr sacarle todo el jugo que merece este libro. Aún así, mi consejo es que si no estás acostumbrado a leer literatura asiática, vayas primero a otro tipo de libro. En fin, ya tenemos un firme candidato a mejor lectura de 2019. MARAVILLA ABSOLUTA.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'To me, the most important part of this book is not su much the fact that the protagonist wanted to become a vegetarian, but the reason why she did it. Is it the violence she lived through with her father? And the big question is, what went on in her dreams? I really was captivated by this book, the way the story is structured, from different points of view, the way it shows society or family as a controling system. The only defect I can think of, is how very short it was. More Han Kang for me please!!'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '[3.0⭐] 𝙇𝙖 𝙫𝙚𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙖 es una novela escrita por Han Kang en el año 2007. La obra es perturbadora y compleja, y explora los límites entre el cuerpo y la mente. La historia se centra en Yeong-hye, una mujer aparentemente sumisa y corriente que decide volverse vegetariana después de tener un extraño sueño. Su decisión provoca una serie de conflictos familiares y personales que revelan las capas profundas de violencia y opresión en la sociedad surcoreana.Con una amiga que también estudia Literatura decidimos leer este libro ya que la escritora ganó este año el Premio Nobel de Literatura y esta era su obra más destacada.Diría que uno de los puntos que más me ha gustado ha sido la estructura de la obra. Esta se divide en tres partes, cada una de ellas está narrada desde el punto de vista de alguien diferente: su esposo, su cuñado y su hermana. A través de estos personajes, la autora logra explorar cómo el rechazo de Yeong-hye a comer carne afecta y desconcierta a quienes la rodean hasta el punto de ir destruyendo cada uno de estos lazos. La novela va ofreciendo poco a poco un retrato sombrío de la incomprensión y el rechazo hacia quienes deciden apartarse de las normas sociales.También, tengo que alabar la pluma de la autora, que es realmente bella, lírica e, incluso, evocadora; logra transmitir la angustia y la transformación psicológica y física que va experimentando la protagonista. La escritora utiliza el cuerpo de la protagonista como una metáfora para la libertad y la alienación, lo que da lugar a momentos visualmente impactantes. Al hacer uso de esta estructura de tres actos, permite que el lector tenga una exploración en capas del trauma y las relaciones tóxicas que rodeaban a la joven.Sin embargo, esta novela puede resultar desconcertante para algunos lectores y, a decir verdad, yo llegué a ser parte de ese grupo. A lo largo de la historia, me pareció un libro extraño y me costó comprender muchas de las imágenes, símbolos y alegorías que parecían tener un significado profundo en la transformación de Yeong-hye. Hace un rato leí a un par de expertos explicar algunas alegorías de la obra y, a decir verdad, con mi amiga nunca hubiésemos dado con esas interpretaciones por nuestra propia cuenta. Siento que si dos estudiantes de último semestre de Literatura no lograron dar con ello, a duras penas podría hacerlo un lector normal.Además, el ritmo de la novela también es un tema; al inicio, se me hizo bastante lento, me costó poder “enganchar” con la obra. Luego, en la segunda parte, me tenía completamente atrapada. Finalmente, en la tercera parte, fui perdiendo el interés hasta el punto en el que solo quería terminar y comenzar con una romcom para despejarme un poco. Es una lectura muy simbólica en donde tienes que tener tu cabeza constantemente activa para ir captando todo. A pesar de ello, siento que no he podido interpretar cien por ciento bien la imagen del final con el pájaro, así que me he sentido bastante frustrada y desalentada. Por ello, no se me ha hecho una novela tan grata de leer y siento que no la he podido disfrutar, la tomé más como un libro para analizar y reflexionar.Finalmente, puedo decir que 𝙇𝙖 𝙫𝙚𝙜𝙚𝙩𝙖𝙧𝙞𝙖𝙣𝙖 es una novela inquietante y única. La exploración de temas como la identidad y la rebelión es profunda, pero la narrativa puede volverse demasiado tediosa con tanta simbología e imágenes. A pesar de ser una obra literaria con mérito, la experiencia de lectura no ha sido del todo grata para mí. Recomiendo este libro para aquellos que busquen una lectura desafiante y abierta a interpretaciones, pero puede no satisfacer a quienes prefieren una narrativa más ligera y menos simbólica.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'LA MACCHIA MONGOLICALei, Yeong-hye, fa un sogno. E quella stessa notte, per impulso del sogno, sbarazza frigo e congelatore di qualsiasi presenza animale: carne, pesce, latte, uova, formaggio. Diventa vegana, più che la vegetariana del titolo. Diventa intransigente. Mangia sempre meno, dimagrisce a dismisura, si nutre di luce (sole) e acqua, come se lei stessa fosse una pianta, come se la sintesi clorofilliana fosse la sua dieta ideale. E, in pratica, smette di dormire: probabilmente si rifiuta di farlo per non ripetere il sogno, che in effetti era piuttosto sanguinolento e impressionante.Il primo capitolo è visto attraverso gli occhi del marito (in prima persona), uomo ordinario, dozzinale, di quelli che non si vorrebbero sposare. Epperò, invece, lui si sente superiore a sua moglie. Probabilmente per questo, dopo che lei ha tentato il suicidio – gesto più dimostrativo che risolutivo – e dopo che è stata dimessa dalla clinica psichiatrica, la caccia di casa e divorzia.Nobuyoshi Araki, qui e sopra.Il secondo capitolo è visto attraverso gli occhi del marito della sorella di Yeong-hye, anche se raccontato in terza persona. Il cognato è un artista, o, se non altro, tale si sente. E comincia a fantasticare sul corpo della cognata vegana, che gli piacerebbe tanto usare come tela da dipingere. Almeno è quello che crede e che si dice per spiegare l’erezione che accompagna ogni visione di Yeong-hye, e ogni pensiero sulla macchia mongolica collocata sopra la sua natica sinistra.Anche il suo matrimonio, come quella della cognata vegana, non funziona. Han Kang lo descrive così:Così era la loro relazione negli ultimi tempi: simile a quella di due soci in affari, che evitavano accuratamente ogni argomento superfluo nei loro scambi e avevano un solo interesse comune, il figlio.Il terzo capitolo, anche questo narrato in terza persona, è attraverso il punto di vista della sorella di Yeong-hye. È rimasta madre single dopo che il marito, il presunto artista, è sparito di casa senza farsi più sentire. D’altronde tenerselo in casa dopo quello che aveva combinato con Yeong-hye non era proprio possibile. È quella che si prende maggiormente cura della sorella vegana.Ma vegana o vegetariana, a me sembra che Yeong-hye cerchi una purezza per ripulirsi da tutta la sporcizia che il mondo maschile le ha rovesciato addosso. Il suo gesto è forse prima di tutto una ribellione al maschilismo e alla violenza del padre, e del marito, e del mondo in genere.Daido Moriyama, questa e le due precedenti.Io sono rimasto particolarmente sorpreso dalla sensazione di muovermi in un mondo conosciuto – ma mai del tutto esplorato, perché infinite sono le potenzialità dell’arte – che non riesco di solito a provare quando leggo letteratura – o vedo cinema – che proviene dall’estremo oriente. C’è un senso di riconoscibilità in tutta la vicenda e la sua ambientazione, nonostante si svolga a Seoul e abbia per protagonista una giovane donna dalle scelte esasperate, spinte e protratte ben oltre l’estremo.Perciò, per fortuna nessuna tinta esotica in questo primo incontro con Han Kang: è il dolore della vegetariana, o vegana - umano, molto umano - che colpisce e rimane impresso.Per concludere, e anche qui sotto, Yayoi Kusama.Curiosità: Han Kang è approdata da noi – con discreto successo mi pare – solo dopo essere stata tradotta in inglese. È stato questo passaggio ad aprirle la porta dell’editoria italiana. E Adelphi ha deciso di tradurre dall’edizione statunitense anziché dal coreano, giustificandosi col fatto che la versione inglese risultava particolarmente efficace e limpida anche a detta dell’autrice, più elegante persino dell’originaleCosì racconta e spiega Vincenzo Latronico nel suo articolo su La Stampa del 26 gennaio 2024 “L’inglese non traduce l’altro mondo”.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Well deserved Nobel Laureate for Literature 2024!Alienating, as if you as a reader are thrown into a nightmare that focuses on what is underneath “real” life. So many dark themes in such a slim work - 4.5 stars rounded upAs if boundaries and limitations didn’t mean anything for her.So many trigger warnings in such a slim book,The Vegetarianis not for the faint of heart, and packs among others animal abuse, domestic violence, rape within marriage, toxic work environments with permanently working to midnight (an early day of from work is arriving home around 20.00), mental health issues, self harm, anorexia and thoughts of suicide.It is hence an achievement fromHan Kangthat as a reader you are still pulled into the story. Certainly taking into account the first narrator, the man of the titular vegetarian Yeong-hye, is quite unsympathetic. Han Kang conjures atmosphere and feelings of foreboding so well, already in the first paragraph I felt antipathy against the first narrator viscerally.From one day to the other, because of a dream, his wife Yeong-hye becomes a social outcast due to her wish to adopt a strict vegan lifestyle. The way her husband interacts with her to begin with is rather appalling, and when she takes on more agency due to her lifestyle choices (amongst others abstaining from sex) his treatment of her deteriorates further.He even literally thinks of her as a comfort girl slash housekeeper at some point.She is, to be fair, rather hermetically closed of against both her husband and the reader. It never becomes clear why she rejects social norms after being seemingly ""perfectly normal"" till a certain point.I never knew the term Shabu Shabu is Korean, it’s the name of a Japanese all-you-can-eat chain here in the Netherlands. During a dinner with work relations of her husband, Shabu Shabu style, one of the attendees indicates that vegetarians freak her out, because she liked to eat live baby squids, and that she does not want to be frowned upon when doing so. Later on we have a short, very intense flashback scene from the youth of Yeong-hye, where a dog is tortured to death and eaten because he bit the main character. It is hence clear that some aspects around animal treatment must have triggered Yeong-hue in changing her eating habits, but Han Kang does not further zoom into the specifics.Still Yeong-hye\'s family rejection of the non-conforming behaviour is clear, and leads to some very uncomfortable scenes with her father trying to force feed her meat. Her mother just simply says to her husband to tell her daughter to stop her diet.The bleak visions on married life continues in part two, Korean societal norms and gender relations don\'t seem very uplifting.In the second part of the book longing, obsession, taboo and the luring call to leave everything behind and do something so drastic it will upend everything in one\'s life, come back with a feverish quality.This brings us to, what I think is one of the key questions at the heart of the book: Can you know another person? Everyone, including her sister, mother and husband talk about the taciturn and unfathomable nature of Yeong-hye and these should have been the people closest to her.And the same applies to the narrator of this part, husband of In-hye (who is the sister of Yeong-hye). In the end he does not even seems to know oneself:Suddenly he got the feeling that he was old, that he had experienced all there is to experience and that even death could not frighten him anymore.This uncovering of the fragility of our seemingly solid and stable lifes, and understanding of others within it, that can change unrecognizably due to just one event, remains in focus for part three of the book.Here In-hye, duty bound, is the narrator.She appears emotionally repressed, composed but in the end is shown to be wrecked by depression and guilt.I’d expected some kind of climax at the end, and there are brutal scenes centered around force feeding. But in a way similar to how Han Kang treats the characters, no clear cut, definitive closure is allowed to us readers.There are beautiful, haunting images scattered throughout the novel.Of people sleeping in baths, cutting themselves just to escape the literal demands from their family, people trying to hurl themselves of a balcony, people being painted on with flowers, of a lone person roaming between trees in the rain, of a tree trying to break out of someone standing on her hands.The Vegetarian is a cerebral, uncomfortable and brutal read that thoroughly impressed me.'}]"

And Jules did not deserve what happened either!- Josh could\'ve treated her nicely or at least be mad at her, but he said much worse things ever, and that was soul-crushing at best. I hated him in that scene, but that doesn\'t mean he\'s not worthy of forgiveness because he\'s, after all, human and has his own traumas and fears!He lacks trust, and everyone in his life betrayed him—his father, his friend—but still, he finally managed to trust Jules only to get betrayed by her too! She had her reasons and came clean, but Jules\' betrayal was just the end of everything! HE SNAPPED.He felt remorseful for his behavior and did his fair share of groveling!THOUGH SOME MORE WOULDN\'T HURT.But whatever, we still got it. AND IF YOU SAY IT\'S FICTIONAL AND BLAH BLAH then shut up because no one wants to read a book full of sweet, nice things without angst, lmao, because I personally don\'t!➤BEFORE Y\'ALL COME AT JOSH, BACK TF OFF 🔪🔪🔪.-ALEX lied to Ava, betrayed her, and said worse things to her too! HE\'S A BILLIONAIRE AND SPENT 1 YEAR AT GROVELING!!!so what? I don\'t fucking care. 🙁-Rhys is cute! Rhys is nice! 💗-Christian stalked Stella despite knowing she fears stalkers and lied to her.-Dante used Vivian just to take revenge on her father.BUT THEY ARE ALL FORGIVEN BECAUSE WHY?? They\'re freaking billionaires.I\'m happy with Josh. No hate to others, though because I love them toonot you Alex, but I just wanted to prove a point....“Did yours? (Opinion changed) Because until we started having sex, you treated me the same as you did in college.”— I\'m glad Jules fucking pointed that out to him! Josh judged Jules as he did in the other books, that she\'s a bad influence, andJules always had suffered from judgment because of her looks, and Josh did the same at the start! Thus making them both hate each other to the core! THOUGH I\'M GLAD JOSH WAS REMORSEFUL FOR WHAT HE SAID, but he was right, opinions do change!And what I loved the most is how Jules did not let him get the upper hand ever! She\'s a baddie! 💪🏻“We got caught in this cycle of insulting and hating each other, and I didn\'t know how to break it.”— and before their awfully amazing sex, they didn\'t know why! And they always insulted each other because it was like muscle memory! 😂 Though I must say the banter was hilarious and my favorite! 🤭“It’s not. Even if I didn’t mean for you to hear it, you did. I hurt you, and I’m sorry.”— cutie!My heart pounded out a hard, territorial rhythm with each step. Mine. Mine. Mine.— caveman! 🤭“You’re my personal hell, Red. And God help me, I don’t want to fucking leave.”— Lmaoo, I remember seeing a meme in which Alex was saying that JOSH SOUNDS LIKE A MASOCHIST! 💀🤣JOSH CHEN:❝ Red, you’ll fall in love with me before I ever fall in love with you. ❞ALSO, JOSH CHEN:❝ You’re mine,” I said against her mouth. “Let another man touch you, Jules, and you’ll find out just how easily I can take a man’s life as I can save one. ❞— ALSO, please, the main part from \'one more hour by tame impala\' evokes some kind of feels inside me while reading twisted hate that it\'s like escaping from this universe and going into a new one! 😩✨ and it\'s own playlist is so good!Imma walk away... this review was much needed for my sanity! 🚶Ratings.𖥔 ݁ ˖Twisted Love(Ava & Alex) – 2 starsTwisted Games(Bridget & Rhys) – 5 starsTwisted Lies(Stella & Christian) – 3 stars'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'If I could give zero stars I would.What the hell happened to Jules???Okay so I will be honest:Jules was this badass girl that I appreciated since book one so I kind of thought that she would be putting Josh into his place in this book and make him work for it.Spoiler: she did not.Maybe it’s just me but I thought that this was a completely different Jules especially after that “Plot twist” scene.It just didn’t make any sense to me.Now let’s talk Josh aka the biggest fucking asshole on this planet that did not deserve to get back without groveling.Now here’s the difference between him and Alex (slight spoiler below):Alex did what he did Bc he thought he was protecting Ava in the long run even if it hurt a bit.Josh purposely and directly wanted to hurt Jules where he knew it would be the most painful. That is completely different and look at what Alex did to get Ava back Vs what Josh did. Oh yeah he did nothing.Josh honestly lost all my respect after that scene and the fact that Jules took him back right after made absolutely no sense.Now the enemies to lovers was not what I thought enemies would be (spoiler below too)Josh cared not even 10% in. He was already talking about hugging and at the 50% mark he said “I never felt that for anyone expect her” as a response to how Alex described his feelings for Ava.

I\'d love to, because I\'ve genuinely grown to love Ana Huang, but I can\'t.I\'ve hidden this review because there are so many spoilers. In fact, it\'s better to go into this book spoiled. Believe you me.A bit of context.The relationship between Jules and Josh has been hinted since book 1, where their banter and \'hate\' is an obvious throw to one of the oldest tropes in romance: enemies-to-lovers. In this case, though, Jules and Josh truly *truly* despise each other. Jules is Josh\'s sister\'s best friend. He thinks Jules is a terrible influence on his sister. When this book begins, Josh and Jules are in their usual status quo of throwing verbal daggers at each other. Life throws them together when they both start work at the same clinic and that\'s when they enter into the truce that would eventually lead to them being together.Josh needs therapy. Seriously.\'Book 1 Josh\' is not the same as \'Book 3 Josh\' and maybe this is the reason \'Twisted Hate\' does and doesn\'t work as a standalone. If you\'re just reading it because you picked it up, ignoring the previous two books, you\'ll miss out on a world of background. \'Book 1 Josh\' is very laid back, a total man-whore and pretty chill about life in general. \'Book 3 Josh\' has serious issues. He was betrayed by Alex, his best friend (which, honestly, it\'s not that big of a deal when you think about it and considering what truly happened) and his father landed himself in prison because he\'s an actual psycho. Josh clearly has a huge amount of pent-up feelings that would have benefitted from a therapist. In fact, it would have been an extraordinary element to add to the story. These obvious issues lead Josh down a fucked up rabbit hole that had drastic, and I mean, DRASTIC repercussions for this book.It goes downhill at about 72% of the book.Jules backstory is revealed to be sad and pretty screwed up. She had to thieve away in order to survive when she was much younger. It\'s not good, but Jules escapes from that life in order to pave her own way and become someone. The fact that Jules is hiding this dark past, does not bode well considering Josh\'s fragile psyche when it comes to, precisely, trust issues. You can see a mile away that it will not end well and things will get ugly. Up until this point in the book, however, it\'s going good. I mean, yes, there\'s the one bed cliché and the fact that Josh falls in love with Jules in a very quick turn-around, yet I can overlook all of this. Their sex is genuinely STEAMY and those first \'hate sex\' scenes DELIVERED. It was working (at least for me it was). Then, Jules is blackmailed by her ex into stealing a painting that Josh has. Now, there are a few things I\'m genuinely pissed about concerning Jules. Her best friend\'s boyfriend, Alex, is THE psycho and I\'m sure that if she\'d asked Ava for help, the problem would have been solved altogether. Secondly, she knows Josh is dealing with trust issues and she decides to come up with this insane idea of staging a break-in and then confessing it was her? I expected honesty from the get-go, to be frank. Jules and Josh have always been honest with each other, if anything else (even when they hated each other). This, however, felt uncharacteristic and a bloody stupid idea. Jules was wrong, yes, but what Josh does? Unforgivable.Unforgivable.Jules ultimately confesses everything to Josh: her past, that she\'d been blackmailed, that she stole the painting and his other things, that she had brought them back and the reasons why she did what she did. Basically, she comes clean to Josh. A little too late, yet she does it anyways and that does take a lot of courage. What does Josh do? The fucking worst. He says that he forgives her, has sex with her only to tell her ""I don\'t forgive you. I lied. How does that feel?"" That shit made ME feel dirty. You don\'t do that to someone you love, let alone someone you know has gone through an inordinate amount of shit. To make matters worse he references that the only thing he\'ll miss is \'her pussy\', which further hammers the nail into the quintessential coffin. Josh was cruel. Horribly, deliberately, cruel, to a point where *I* stopped cheering for him altogether. I read another reviewer that questioned \'consent\' under this whole scenario. I\'m not going to go there, but I will tell you, it was underhanded and definitely wrong. After that moment in the book, I was just focused on finishing it and getting it over. I didn\'t think he deserved forgiveness, especially since he didn\'t do much to earn it anyways (just ask her for it). Jules shouldn\'t have forgiven him for that shit. Also, when Jules is hurt (because the blackmailing ex pushes her down some stairs), Josh treats her (in the ER- because he\'s a doctor), in the most detached and cold way possible. Despite this, he goes after the ex and beats the living shit out of him. This was, apparently, the catharsis he needed to feel better about the events he\'d gone through in the past two years. Dude, no. YOU NEED THERAPY (and maybe Jesus). Also, I\'d like reiterate that Josh is a doctor and he\'s not supposed to be beating people to the point of near-death. Alex... ALEX THE PSYCHO, is the one to stop him [you know things are bad when the actual psycho hero from Book 1 (and \'alphahole\') is more human than the protagonist]. So yeah, excuse me if I really wish nothing good for Josh.Conclusion.Really disappointed and sad. I had great expectations concerning this book and they went right down the drain. If you decide to open the \'spoilers\' in this review, you\'ll see that there are legit reasons for you to skip this book. I would, however, recommend \'Twisted Games\' (aka Book 2 of the series).

Will I still read Twisted Lies? Sure thing. 😂I’m going to time this review so let’s see what I can come up with for Twisted Hate in 5 minutes, before I hit publish:– be aware might contain spoilers –🏮something about the pace of the book felt off for me, from the blurb I expected Josh and Jules to go right into their on-night stand and from there had that ‘frenemies with benefits’ arrangement, but it was actually super slow, cause nothing happened between them in the first 30%, except them insulting each other, which was fine the first 10%, but after that got boring. I wanted them to at least kiss, but crickets.🏮Ana could have done so much with that skiing trip with Jules & Josh and even included the one bed trope, but it went nowhere. One chapter they were all sitting together eating lunch and Jules running to the toilet to puke and then the next chapter we jump right back into Jules being back at work after their weekend trip, which didn’t make any sense to me. The transition was just so bad and I thought I might have missed a scene or two.🏮at least the Jules & Josh sexy scenes didn’t disappoint me and delivered. The hate sex between them especially the first time was explosive and that shit was good food.🏮but ngl I was a lil concerned at how much and fast Jules could orgasm... Josh only had to pump into her a couple of times and suddenly she came like 5 times in a row. Josh really knew what he was doing. 🤣🏮while I thought the first third of the book was pretty boring, I liked the rest of it much better when Jules and Josh opened up a little and they had some very cute scenes together. My fav one is when Jules mother died and she flew home, at the same time Josh had a trip planned to New Zealand, but he didn’t go and instead changed his flight to be there for Jules and surprised her in Ohio. My heart melted reading that scene! 🥺🏮okay maybe I lied, cause I have another fav scene: when Josh took Jules out on their first date and it was a bookstore scavenger hunt. I thought that was fucking cute, because the idea? the planning? the creativity? so sweet!!🏮I didn’t like how Josh reacted when he found out how Jules deceived him, but I loved how Josh beat up Jules ex, the guy who pushed her down the stairs, not that one thing balance out the other, but it got me some satisfaction lol.🏮cute contemporary romance, not bad, not good, but overall nothing special. On par with how I feel about the rest of the series, but for a contemporary romance it should have been over 500 pages long.ConclusionWhile Twisted Hate didn't exactly met my expectation, it was the best book in the series so far and Joshjules are superior. 😌┍━━━━━━━━»•» «•«━┑TWISTED SERIES#1 Twisted Love – 2.75 stars#2 Twisted Games – 3 stars#3 Twisted Hate – 3.25 stars#4 Twisted Lies – tbr┕━»•» «•«━━━━━━━━┙""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'the small dick energy radiating off this man can be felt from pluto'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5redstarsJosh Chen is so damn hot.

Let me tell you, Josh and Jules? Their dynamic was everything.This is literally how josh and Jules were:Jules: “why do you care?”Josh: “I shouldn’t be fucking caring!”Me:Okay, first off, Jules is a vibe. She\'s literally the opposite of Ava, and I am HERE for it. She\'s bold, confident, and doesn\'t take crap from anyone especially men. Like, the girl is a meneater, but in the best way. She\'s got that tough exterior, but you can tell there\'s so much depth under all that sass. I loved how she constantly stuck up for her friends, even when they didn\'t do the same for her. And Josh, as much as I wanted to scream at him sometimes, thank you for finally giving Jules the love and care she\'s been craving her whole life 🥲❝You ever hear the saying, the bigger the ego, the smaller the penis?❞❝You know what they say about men who talk a big game? They\'re overcompensating for the smallest packages.❞❝I liked her already. Any woman who called Josh out earned an A-plus in my book.❞Jules really did put Josh in his place, and I loved every second of it. She\'s a baddie, no doubt.Now, Josh? He\'s definitely not my typical book boyfriend type. But I gotta admit, he was a refreshing change compared to the usual Ctrl+ C Ctrl+ V mmcs Ana Huang usually writes. He\'s literally Jules\'s other half. Their personalities clicked so well, and the banter between them? Iconic. But chapter 46? Bruh, I was shook. Josh was acting like a straight-up child. Comparing what Jules did to him to what Alex and Michael did?No, no, no. First off, those two have known you for years; you\'ve barely known Jules, you judged her for 7 years, you acted like her enemy. And it was a vulnerable situation that she didn’t mention even to her close friends. loser behavior.”It seems only fitting for us to end things with a goodbye fuck. At least you got an orgasm out of it, so don\'t say I never gave you anything. I\'ll miss that tight pussy of yours though. No one takes my cock better than you do. It\'s your best quality.”...I mean, come on. Vomit. If I were Jules, I would\'ve never forgiven him for that. He basically called her a whore. Ugh. That whole moment was just... gross. And let\'s be real, his groveling needed to be way longer to be even remotely redeemable.Look, I loved Josh\'s humor and how well he matched Jules\'s energy, but Ana Huang really made it hard to root for him after that. Like, seriously, why did she have to mess him up like that? He had potential to be memorable, but that move ruined it for me.“you die, I die, Red. Hell with you sounds like heaven to me”“The was corny as fuck josh”“Yeah, so? I’m hot enough to pull it off”Okay, not gonna lie, the back-and-forth banter between these two was giving me life. Their chemistry is everything, and even though Josh was kind of a jerk sometimes, he had these moments where he made me laugh so hard. I hate Ana for ruining him.~ Ava & AlexStill my least favorite, but it must be said: Alex is obsessed with Ava. Like, borderline unhealthy obsessed. I still don\'t like them, but there\'s no denying that he loves her way too much.~ Bridget & RhysI mean, these two? THE IT COUPLE. They radiate so much power, I feel like I\'m about to combust just reading about them. They\'ve got this whole dynamic that\'s just next level.~ Stella & ChristianOkay, I\'m beyond hyped for these two. Christian Harper gives off major ""perfect match"" energy with me, and I\'m all in. The way he was obsessed with her from the jump?Yum.Twisted Hate was solid for me, honestly. I didn\'t hate it, even with all the messiness Josh caused. The explosive chemistry between him and Jules made up for a lot. I had a lot of fun reading about them. But let\'s be real, this book wasn\'t without its flaws. Let\'s talk about the plot for a sec. It\'s honestly the only one in the series that felt even somewhat ""normal"" and straight forward. Like, finally, a book with a somewhat reasonable plot in this series. Write that down, history books.I loved how Jules and Josh went from enemies to lovers. The pacing was perfect for me. But here comes Ana Huang with her trademark third-act breakup ruining everything. It wasn\'t necessary here at all. Like, seriously, why?With Alex and Ava, okay, it made sense, but with Jules and Josh? Nah. Shut the fuck up, Ana. Please. It just didn\'t work, and it dragged the whole thing down.But as with most of her books, Twisted Hate didn\'t get a high rating from me. They\'re fun reads, but nothing about them is really special. They fall into the ""acceptable, mediocre"" category, which is a shame because I did have fun, just don\'t expect this to be anything groundbreaking.yes I’m petty I’m giving this rate bc of chapter 46.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'enemies to lovers..

If I was rating solely based on entertainment value, I would likely rate this a little higher, but there was a lot I didn’t love about their relationship. They were very harsh and rough with each other for a good portion of the book and he said some truly awful things to her. A lot of the plot hinges on poor communication or lies by omission which I also don’t love. She keeps quiet about a major detail from her past and betrays his trust, but the way he treated her and spoke to her when she came clean was absolutely despicable. I would describe his actions as abuse. I had already felt like a lot of their relationship was toxic and sometimes even toed the line of nonconsensual, but angry or not, he took things way too far. If this were a real life scenario, I don’t think he would have deserved a second chance after using her and discarding her in that way. Dark romance exists, so there are clearly a lot of people out there who are into reading about toxic relationships 🙃, but I can’t in good conscience give more than 3 stars to a book that made my lip curl in disgust this many times.This is fiction, so maybe it’s not such a big deal, but the plot of this book AND Twisted Love felt a little too far fetched to me. I’m supposed to believe that the man who hurt her in her past is released from prison and immediately goes looking for the one specific piece of obscure art that happens to be hanging over her new boyfriend’s bed? 😅 Give me a break. Maybe if the old boyfriend had tracked her down BECAUSE of a post of them together that featured the art in the background or something I might have been able to buy into it, but even that would have been a stretch.I’ll admit that this was at least better than Twisted Love but Josh Chen will never be added to my book boyfriend list. 🙅🏼\u200d♀️✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼\u3000 ҉ \u3000✼Pre-read:Twisted Love: Two Stars ✩ ✩Twisted Games: Four Stars ✩ ✩ ✩ ✩Twisted Hate: ??????????????I’m seeing a lot of mixed reviews on this one, but I’m hoping it will at least be better than Twisted Love.

Hannah Wells has finally found someone who turns her on. But while she might be confident in every other area of her life, she's carting around a full set of baggage when it comes to sex and seduction. If she wants to get her crush's attention, she'll have to step out of her comfort zone and make him take notice...even if it means tutoring the annoying, childish, cocky captain of the hockey team in exchange for a pretend date. ...and it's going to be oh so good All Garrett Graham has ever wanted is to play professional hockey after graduation, but his plummeting GPA is threatening everything he's worked so hard for. If helping a sarcastic brunette make another guy jealous will help him secure his position on the team, he's all for it.

Now he just has to convince Hannah that the man she wants looks a lot like him.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': '9/3/2018Updated my review because it was very long and I criticized things that in hindsight aren\'t as big a deal1.5 starsTW: Rape (mentions throughout + flashback scene), domestic violence/abuseLet me disclaim that there was MASSIVE potential here for a good book, but it had so many problems. I began highlighting lines that said problematic things, and I ended up having 147 notes of things that made me cringe or things that made me uncomfortable. If this book went under rigorous editing it could be the feminist read I think it\'s trying to be, but there\'s way too much perpetuation of gender stereotypes/roles, slut shaming, internalized misogyny, and overused/toxic tropes occurring.To set the mood for this review, read this real line in this book:(girl speaking) “You know what I think?”(male love interest speaking) “Women aren’t supposed to think, Wellsy. That’s why your brains are smaller. Science proves it.”Wooowwwww. Even if that’s a joke, fuck off.People reviewed this saying things like “Garrett is sooo different than other guys in NA!” And in one way, I can see it, but he’s not nearly good enough to be considered a ""good"" guy, in my opinion. It begins with him relentlessly asking the main character to tutor him. For chapters. And chapters. She says no to him EVERY TIME and yet he still corners her at parties and after class and is like ‘hey! when are we studying!’ I don\'t like how disrespectful he was of her space and her time from page one.One of the first times the two main characters see each other, they’re at a party and Hannah is eyeing the guy she has a crush on. Garrett is SUPER creepy because he catches her looking and is like “do you want to fuck him?” Which is 1) a disturbing question and 2) noNE OF YA GODDAMN BUSINESS. and even though it\'s uncomfy I just shook it off, but then he proceeds to tell her, “You’re not his type.” And she’s really wounded by this, yet he’s grinning and smirking like he’s proud of himself as he makes fun of her for liking him. HE LITERALLY CALLS HER A PUSSY FOR LIKING HIM AND NOT TELLING HIM, AND HE ALSO MAKES FUN OF HER FOR HAVING A CRUSH ON HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE.YDFGVSJHBKFLFSYG THAT’S SO SHITTY UGHHHHHWhen Hannah finally agrees to tutor him (after some coercion), he says, “I managed to wear her down.” This is just so degrading. She couldn’t even agree to it willingly—he practically forced her to because he wouldn’t leave her alone about it and she was beginning to see him everywhere and just wanted him to shut up.FURTHERMORE, He coerces her into a relationship because he tells her “hey! if you go out with me, it will make you look like you have a higher status, he’ll notice you, and you can finally be up to his standards so that he’ll date you!” How….. is this normal. How is this supportable. I’m just appalled. This entire book perpetuated the concept of—and Garrett says this himself— “guys only want girls who give them a chase, and they want a woman who’s out of reach because guys want what they can’t have.” gross gross gross gross why can’t we just have 2 people falling in love? EVER? why does it have to be some slimy shit like this???Later on in the book Hannah explains to Garrett why she doesn’t drink (she’s scared of getting drugged due to past sexual assault) and he gets really serious and is like “I want you to drink. I think you should drink. I’d never let anyone hurt you” and she’s kind of pushed into it? During that same scene when she drinks with him for the first time, he stands by passively as she has 3 drinks (gulping down the first one), and then watches and laughs as she’s on stage stumbling through karaoke. He acts like “Oh, I’ll protect you! Don’t be afraid of drinking!” but then doesn’t even promote healthy drinking, or keep her from embarrassing situations. In fact, as she’s on stage singing, all he’s thinking is “I want to kiss her right now” and “im hard as a rock in the middle of this bar.” He later notices how drunk she is and says, I quote, “I love being the one who got her to this point."" at the end of the night they both end up wasted and Garrett, just in his boxers, crawls into bed with Hannah, who\'s only in a T-shirt. he’s taken five shots and makes a comment that’s like, “even if I wanted to take advantage of her right now I wouldn’t be able to,” referring to his limp dick, but he basically just implied raping her???? byeeee!!! They start making out and in his drunken state he thinks, “I know this is bad but I’m too drunk to care.” Ew.Also, there was slut shaming in this book. The main character constantly refers to the women that have sex with athletes as girls who don’t know any better. Girls who are stupid. She constantly places herself above all the girls that Garrett usually has sex with because she assumes that she’s better and smarter than them for not falling for his tricks. Additionally, there\'s a lot of pitching women against each other and comparing body types/beauty, so this isn\'t really the prime feminist literature that it wants to be. It’s just a constant narrative of “i’m better than some girls!!” which sucks. In this vein, Garrett calls the MC a ""total pig compared to other girls i know"" for eating 4 slices of pizza. this scene is punctuated by him saying ""there\'s nothing attractive about a girl who\'s skin and bones. i prefer them curvy."" barf gag. bye no thank uThis was cheesy. So bad. It read like fanfiction, or a wattpad smut. Totally cookie-cutter characters with predictable actions. Take a shot every time Hannah rolls her eyes, bites her lip, clenches her thighs, or sighs (you’d be in the hospital by page 5. Seriously. This girl rolls her eyes like twice a page). Completely unoriginal. The dialogue was so cringe-worthy I literally had to put down the book at a few points:“Just out of curiosity,” she says, “after you wake up in the morning, do you admire yourself in the mirror for one hour or two?”“Two,” I reply cheerfully.“Do you high five yourself?”“Of course not.” I smirk. “I kiss each of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for creating such a perfect male specimen.”NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT!!!! NOBODY!!!!! oh my god i’m so heated about this. I’m a college junior, the same age as the characters in this book, and i would r u n if someone started talking to me like this. Automatic no.Soooo I have a preconceived notion of male student athletes. They’re more prone to being rapists. They’re reckless. They eat all the food in the dining hall right before I get there. I’ve never read a great book or interacted enough with male student athletes to prove this wrong, but this book certainly doesn’t help. Every guy is sex-obsessed and calls girls “baby girl” and makes crude jokes. Maybe it’s realistic, maybe it’s not. But this book does nothing to disband my belief that athletes are the worst. So was I excited about Garrett and wanting to date him because he’s ~so nice~ and ~so respectful toward women~? No. And the way that Hannah reacts to all these sexist comments is really off-putting. Everytime, without fail, all she does is roll her eyes and go, “Ugh, boys! What can you do!” For me to take a standing ovation to this, she would have needed to threaten their asses and call them out for their sexist and uncalled for comments. Instead, she just treats it like it’s annoying rather than something harmful and disturbing. I think it’s strange that she’s a rape victim, and yet she finds their comments more annoying than threatening. At one point, one of Garrett’s roommates actually threatens her to tutor him:“I’ll be very, very upset.” His sultry gaze does a slow and deliberate sweep of my body, lingering on my chest before traveling back up. “You don’t want to upset me, do you, gorgeous?”Vomit?????And instead of Garrett being like, “Hey man, that’s shitty, treat her with some respect,” he instead SNORTS and says, “Don’t waste your time, man. She’s immune to flirting. Trust me. I’ve tried.”At one point Garrett is trying to convince her to sing for him (btw, she\'s a music major lol) and she says, “I know Garrett will harass me all night if I don’t agree.” She even uses the word harassment!!! She knows she’s being mistreated and coerced, and yet she just acquiesces every time. I’m so tired. The problem with this is this whole book promotes the “boys will be boys” attitude. Any time an athlete says something gross, the MC just rolls her eyes. And despite that, she’s like “Garrett protects me from bad things!” and yet Garrett doesn’t do a fucking thing except feel jealous any time that someone makes an uncomfortable advance on her or teases her about something inappropriate or asks her a gross, flirtatious question. This all needed to have been challenged in the book, but it isn’t. It’s just brushed away as “hahaha these boys are the worst, they’re athletes, but what can you do?!?!?!” It’s infuriating.this book is also one of many that use the trope ""well ive been with boys before but i\'ve never orgasmed or enjoyed sex so i think im broken"" and Mr. Right comes along and suddenly she\'s a sexual goddess!!! i think it\'s just another version of the guy-fixes-girl trope, and i think it\'s really annoying. you can have orgasms and special connections with each of your partners; it doesn\'t all have to suddenly be ""aND HE WAS PERFECT FOR ME BECAUSE I CAME 10 TIMES!!! OUR LOVE IS LEGITIMIZED!!!!!"" At the most frustrating part of this book, she LITERALLY tells him, “I’m broken and I want you to fix me.” Don’t get me wrong, there’s definitely a compelling motivation there because she feels after being raped that she can never have normal, enjoyable sex. But that’s a problem to talk about with a therapist, not to assign to a random dude, or even a boyfriend. It’s just so wrong. She wants to use him to “reprogram her body to respond.” This just falls into the category of books I hate where I just want to scream GET HELP, NOT A BOYFRIEND.The few good parts about this book that I wish could have made it better:-When Hannah asks Garrett for the first time if he wants to have sex, it’s done really assertively and transparently. I like that she felt confident enough to be direct, and when he asked her why, she had no problem saying, “Because I want to.” That was a powerful moment for me. (Even though the scene ended by her saying ‘im broken, fix me.” it was nice while it lasted)-Garrett is SO much more attentive to her after he finds out she was raped. Almost to the point that I’d wished she told him sooner so that he could quit being an asshole. Still, he’s over-protective and their relationship and dialogue and descriptions fits every gender stereotype, so there��s a long way to go.-The sex scenes are really, really slow-going and consensual. Not entirely sexy and flawless, but not unbearable.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'SQUEEE!!!! I loooooved this book!! I was hooked from the very first page and spent the rest of my afternoon laughing out loud, swooning, fanning myself, and highlighting awesome and hilarious quotes non-stop!So it\'s about this girl, Hannah, who is crushing hard on a football player. She\'s not one to usually get this mushy over a guy, but he\'s caught her eye and she wishes she was on his radar.The hero is a a guy named Garrett. He\'s a bad boy hockey player with a bit of a manwhoring reputation around campus who is in one of her classes and borderline failing. He\'s a smart guy, but this class just isn\'t his forte. Lucky for him, she\'s acing it... and he makes it his mission to get her to tutor him. Unfortunately for him though, she\'s not remotely interested in anything he has to offer in exchange.“How about a date?” I offer.That gets her attention. She straightens up like someone shoved a metal rod up her spine, then swivels her head in astonishment. “What?”“Ah. I’ve got your attention.”“No, you’ve got my disgust. You actually think I want to go out with you?”“Everyone wants to go out with me.”She bursts out laughing…“Just out of curiosity,” she says, “after you wake up in the morning, do you admire yourself in the mirror for one hour or two?”“Two,” I reply cheerfully.. “I kiss each one of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for creating such a perfect male specimen.”She snorts. “Uh-huh. Well, sorry to burst your bubble, Mr. Perfect, but I’m not interested in dating you.""After a few days of trying his best to wear her down, he finally comes up with an idea: he\'ll help elevate her social status by pretending to date her -- thus making her more likely to catch the eye of her crush IF she\'ll tutor him. She finally relents and the deal is formed.But the more time they spend together, the closer they get... and even though Garrett swore he didn\'t want a girlfriend, he falls for her... and makes it his mission to show her that he\'s actually the guy she wants.I have to say, this is the first time a girl’s been worried about getting caught in my bedroom. Normally they strut out like they’ve just bagged Brad Pitt.Hannah takes a breath. “We studied. We watched TV. I went home late. That’s what happened. Got it?”I fight back laughter. “As you wish.”“Did you really just Princess Bride me?”“Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?”She glowers.I loved the way their relationship developed almost by accident. Neither of them meant for it to happen. They just began hanging out, spending time together, and one thing naturally led to another. (Side note: after reading about them watching Breaking Bad together, I kinda want to watch the show too!)Just to clear up a question I\'ve been asked by several readers: there is NO cheating and no triangle in this story. He does hook up with two girls (literally just meaningless one-night stands) before he and Hannah become a couple. But once they\'re together, all that ends. So don\'t worry!This book had the ability to make me swoon one minute, put my heart in my throat the next, then literally make me burst right out laughing out of the blue. Here, I just have to share this one scene...The guy protests… “I don’t think you should go in th—“I burst into the locker room and —Penises!Sweet Jesus.Penises everywhere.Horror slams into me as I register what I’m seeing. Oh God. I’ve stumbled onto a penis convention. Big penises and small penises and fat penises and penis-shaped penises. It doesn’t matter which direction I move my head because everywhere I look I see penises.My mortified gasp draws the attention of every penis — er, guy, in the room. In a heartbeat, towels snap up and hands cover junk and bodies shuffle around, while I stand in the front of the room blushing like a tomato.Teeheeeeee!!!! C\'mon, doesn\'t that make you want to read the book?? :DYou\'ll swoon hard over Garrett, wish Hannah was your BFF, and totally get caught up in their story. It\'s fun, sexy, but with just enough \'seriousness\' mixed in to ground the story as well. I really loved it!This was one of the best college romance I\'ve read. It had epic banter, sexy romance, and fantastic writing!! I laughed, I swooned, I couldn\'t put it down. Highly recommended!!Rating: 5 stars. Standalone NA romance.PS: This is the first standalone in a series of standalones. The next book will be a different couple._______________________________________For more of my reviews, book news and updates:✦Main blog: Aestas Book Blog✦Facebook Blog Page✦Twitter✦Subscribe by email'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""5 stars!What can I say aboutThe Dealthat hasn’t been said in hundreds of other reviews… Well, I can say I regret being so late to the party on this one. I had a friend recommend this to me when she read it back in February and every few weeks I would get a message from her asking if I’d read it yet (thanks for pushing, Jen!) I can’t say why I waited to read this, I just got busy with other books. One things for sure though, I’ll be reading book 2 in this series very soon! No more waiting for me.Hannah Wells is a smart woman. She is so smart in fact, she’s one of the only people doing well in a certain class she’s in. Garrett is having trouble with this class and it’s bringing down his entire GPA, which he can’t have being a star hockey player and all. So there is one solution. Get Hannah to tutor him. There is also one problem, Hannah is resistant to Garrett’s charms. When she finally agrees, they strike a DEAL. They become friends, then they kiss. And everything changes.Hannah and Garrett were perfect together. I loved their banter and friendship. I loved even more when it developed. They had such fantastic chemistry. And it wasn’t just about the sex between them. Those weeks of friendship made them really care about one another and get to know each other.I can say with absolute certainty that there wasn’t one thing I didn’t love about this book. And as much as I love books and love to read, that doesn’t happen very often. I wouldn’t change a thing about this read.

Yup. This book made me happy. Throughout the whole thing I was either giggling, laughing, sniffling, blushing, and then smiling and laughing some more.And I\'m not even sorry because heck, with so much shit happening in the world right now, it\'s nice to find a book that you can unabashedly get yourself lost in.The Deal was another one of those unexpected reads. Unexpected because despite its simple plot, this book succeeded in taking over my heart and my mind. Always a good sign for a reader.Like what I said, the plot for this book is simple. Hannah is college girl with a lot of baggage especially when it comes to sex, so when she finally found someone who makes her feel tingly, she was out of her depth especially when he seems to be unaware of her existence. But then solution comes in the form of cocky player Garrett Graham. Garrett\'s life revolve around hockey, so when he failed in one of his subjects, he needed a tutor or else he\'ll be dropped by the team.When Garrett noticed that Hannah got an A on the same subject, he needled her into agreeing to his tutor. Hannah initially refused but Garrett was persistent. When Garrett found out about her dilemma, he offered a solution: he\'ll help her land the guy in exchange for a tutoring session. And thus begin their unlikely friendship.Despite the straightforward plot, this won me over just by the strength of Elle Kennedy\'s writing, flawed yet ,b>relatable andlikablecharacters and by its sheer readability. I could not put this book down. I devoured it from beginning to end. And the dialogue just sparkled.Hannah and Garrett despite being opposites on paper (he\'s a jock while she\'s a music major) have a lot more in common. They were at odds at first, with Hannah being unimpressed by Garrett, but Garrett proved to be not only charming but truly a real nice guy. And he slowly but surely demolished the walls Hannah had put up to protect herself.I know what you\'re thinking, ""Oh another heroine with issues."" And she does. A mile wide, in fact. Hannah\'s back story was heartbreaking as was Garrett\'s. But despite that, their characters weren\'t overburdened by it. Both Hannah and Garrett have already overcome their issues. They have goals and dreams apart from each other, which was refreshing to read.Most of the time, in this genre, the story often get drowned out by its characters personal tragedies. With this book, while it was an integral part of the plot, it didn\'t suffocate the story. It helped to enrich it, giving readers an insight into the characters but their issue wasn\'t treated as another plot device.I just loved Garrett and Hannah. Their chemistry jumps off the page. Even when they were snipping and goading each other, you feel it. I loved that after their initial introduction to each other, they took their time to be friends first. Then their awareness for each grew and holy freakin\' hell, the slow burn was wonderful to behold.^^Me aw-awwing at the Garrett and Hannah banterSeriously, I cannot wait for you guys to meet Garrett. He is one of the best heroes I\'ve read so far. He\'s definitely arrogant and can be quite a handful but he\'s also the sweetest and the most loyal hero ever. I cannot even begin to tell you how wonderful this character is. Truly a standout hero in my opinion.Overall, while The Deal didn’t break any new ground in the NA genre, it perfectly pulled some of its familiar tropes and made it work. And it\'s a testament to Elle Kennedy’s skill as an author. It also proves that you don’t have to break the rules to write an engaging and well-thought of story. All it really takes a familiar plot but well-developed plot, add some flawed but relatable characters, unforgettable dialogue and the end result will be on unputdownable book.ARC courtesy of Elle Kennedy in exchange for an honest review.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I don\'t write reviews for books I DNF. However, this can\'t remain unsaid.Why did Garret have to write a paper on philosophers whojustifiedwhat happened in Nazi Germany? Why did you let your character say: ""I finally got this Nazi thing down"" when he finally aced his homework?Any book that has the sentence: ""in theory there is an argument to be made for genocide"" (page 106)does not deserve to be published.Why did you think you could/should/had to discuss something as heavy as Nazi Germany in a jock sports romance book for teenagers when you write at sixth grade level? The lack of sensitivity is INSANE.Why did you give your female main character the trauma of being sexually abused if you were going to have Garret manipulate her into kissing him while she is thinking""Just do it, you don\'t even have to like it"" the whole time?Why did you have a character tell her, a girl trying to heal from sexual abuse, that the only way other guys will like her is if they SEE HER AS A CHALLENGE and think they have COMPETITION. I can\'t even...Why do I keep reading books that are overhyped? I guess we will never know.Am I going to continue with this series?Nah. I\'m good.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5 stars!!If only there were more NA romances like this one!This book completely charmed me, and is probably one of the best college romances I’ve read in a while now. While the premise isn’t anything I haven’t read before, I felt like the author took the idea and shaped it into her own unique tale, so trust me when I say it’s not your typical NA romance riddled with common clichés. This book was definitely one of those unexpected gems: the more I read, the more I fell in love with the delightful main characters, the witty banter, and the steamy and impassioned romance. Elle Kennedy, you’ve got yourself a new fan!A big reason to why this book was such a winner for me was the hero Garrett. It may be just me, but I’m a little tired of heroes who are bad boys and jerks...I mean, give me a guy who’ll actually live up to the title of ‘hero’ you know? And Garrett really did. He’s a sports jock who’s not only dedicated to playing hockey, but also in getting his grades up as well and has such a fun-loving, caring personality. It’s really hard not to fall for him! When his grades drop though, and his hockey-playing goal is in jeopardy, he finds the class smartie to tutor him, leading him right to the heroine Hannah.Studious and practical, Hannah is pursuing her goals as a songwriter/singer and is pretty confident in all areas of her life, except her sex life that is. She’s finally found one guy who catches her interest but with absolutely zero seduction skills she’s at a loss. When Garrett barges into her life asking for her to tutor him, they agree on a deal: she’ll tutor him so he can bring up his grades and be able to keep playing hockey, and in exchange he’ll pretend-date her to catch her crush’s attention.I LOVE that there’s no insta-love, and heck, the attraction didn’t settle in until later too. Hannah and Garrett’s relationship is very much a gradual build, going from barely acquaintances to tentative friends to an explosive couple. But I’ll also admit that in the very beginning of this book, I wasn’t fully into the story and the characters until later. I didn’t like how judgmental Hannah was towards Garrett in the start, partially because her crush was in the same position (both sports players) as him and she chose to stereotype Garrett while glorifying the other guy, even when Garrett’s actions were always honorable and meant well. But as I read on, my dislike for Hannah thawed out and I ended up really loving her character. I liked that despite her very strong personality, she had this layer of vulnerability and her backstory (actually, both hers and Garrett’s) hurt to read. And of course, I loved Garrett’s patience and understanding with her, and how he propelled their relationship forward one step at a time.I also appreciated that there wasn’t any contrived drama, which almost always exists in the NA books I read. Any and all conflict in this story was handled well, very thought-out and dare I say, practical too. I love that the author doesn’t follow the norm and to balance out the angst, she’s got a wonderful sense of humor that’s evident in the story. Almost everything I highlighted in the book were passages of snarky/witty/laugh out loud hilarious banter that made me laugh the entire time I read. And the locker scene near the end of the book? Freaking EPIC I tell you!Much like the way Hannah and Garrett surprised each other and everyone else when they fell in love, this book also surprised me in the best of ways.Love NA romance?You’ll hit gold with this book.Not a fan of NA romance?Take a chance and let this book work its charm on you too.The Dealis a NA romance standalone and the first book in the Off-Campus series.

The writing was good and there was enough drama for me without it being too angsty.For my angst whores out there, I don\'t know if this would be enough for you...but for those of us who aren\'talwaysin the mood to feel nauseous when reading, this is a great option when you need an angst break.Hannah was a good lead. She was smart and confident and pretty much had her shit together.Garrett was the typical manwhore......because...romance novel......And also because - as a former college athlete who hada lotof college male athlete friends - they reallyaremanwhores in real life.And they reallydohave sorority groupie girls who throw themselves at them on the regular.Seriously, I knew a girl who slept her way through half the basketball team and the majority of the soccer team.Man, I was really tired that year.Seriously, I kid.***************I wasn\'t in a sorority.And I preferred baseball players.But I digress.Hannah and Garrett were really cute together.And I am always a sucker for the ""let\'s pretend to be together and then oops we fall for each other"" trope, which I thought was really well done here.I will definitely read more from this author.XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX24 hours after writing this review...'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5 WINNING STARSWhat an enjoyable read that seriously didn’t bring anything crazy original to this genre but somewhere between the fantastic characters, the banter, and the delivery, this story was a huge winner for me. My swooning and laughing while being totally engrossed along the pages of this story has to go to the fantastic writing of a truly talented writer. I need to check out her other books because it seems I’ve been totally missing out!I loved the plot of our hockey jock, Garrett Graham harassing the musician, Hannah Wells for tutoring help in their shared class so he doesn’t lose ice time. When these two eventually settle on a deal for an exchange of her tutoring services for Garrett’s popularity in gaining her the attention of the newly transferred football star, Hannah can’t resist.”The make up is next Friday, which gives us a week and a half to study. I’ll write the exam, and then on Saturday night we’ll go to Maxwell’s party and show Loverboy how sexy and desirable you are. He won’t be able to resist, trust me.”Every single interaction between Hannah and Garrett was perfection. They slowly form a friendship and fall into so much more.”How do you feel about Lynyrd Skynyrd? Or do you only like bands where the guys coordinate their outfits?”Garrett was a perfectly imperfect hero. He was hilarious, sarcastic and so very sexy. Every girl reading this book will wish they were Hannah. He struggles with being in his famous father’s shadow while continuing to survive his wrath. I must mention that I also loved all his roommates and am excited that they will follow with their own stories.”Except…am I competing? I’m still not sure what I even want from her. I mean fine, I want sex. I want it very, very badly. But if by some miracle she decides to give it to me, what then? What happens after? Do I stick a flag in the ground and claim her as my girlfriend?”Hannah has survived rape in her past and is a witty, resilient and strong heroine. Remnants of the rape have left her insecure in certain areas. I truly loved how she slowly begins to trust her friendship with Garrett and embracing what they find in one another. Hannah was bold and I think their combined personalities is one of the things that made me fall for them as a couple so very hard.Also, it must be mentioned that the intensity of their sex scenes was completely palpable and electric.”Show me what you do to yourself when you’re alone,” he coaxes. “I…” The lump in my throat is too big to speak past. His voice grows hoarse and seductive. “Show me, and I’ll show you.”I can’t think of one negative thing about this story except perhaps if it was possible for a story to never end I would have been the perfectly happy day after day reading on and on about Garrett and Hannah.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Well...

They are either too cheery or they are the brooding type. But the thing that connects both of these type of characters are their alpha male energy whose cells (I suck at biology so it might not make sense) are covered with a special layer of overconfidence and arrogance so you can't ever expect them to lose their confidence.And don't even get me started on the female characters. They are not like other girls obviously. They might not be very social, but there has to be one boy (who's obviously the main male character) whom they hate for no reasons. Oh no I know the reason. They hate them because well if we are talking specifically about a sports romance then who doesn't like stereotyping every single male who plays some sport? He plays hockey? Well then he HAS to be an asshole just like all of his teammates are.And the greatest question of all time - Why the fuck is every person who plays sport in this book described like only handsome people play sports. Why don't we have a cinnamon roll type of character who plays sports? Introverts can play sports too right? There's a scene where furious Hannah barges inside the locker room and every single person is NAKED? Am I the only person who found it weird or does these things really happen irl? (I have basically 0 knowledge about sports so I could be wrong but I was really weirded out after reading this)Garrett is a walking red flag for fuck's sake. I hate him so much. This dude takes no hint and thinks that just because he's the hockey team's leader and has a good body, he owns everyone on this earth. Like hell no p-uh-lease.So the story goes like- Garrett fails a test and his average goes down so he needs to do well in the retest or her won't be able to play hockey. Then he accidentally sees Hannah's (the female lead) grade (she aces the test) and asks her to tutor him. She says no because she's busy. But this guy here keeps on pestering her.Garrett's thought process throughout the book:I want to check out her ass again, because it’s a damn sexy ass, and now that I’ve seen it I wouldn’t mind another look.Because…again…I’m a guy.Like fuck off. I know you are a guy. You don't have to say that again and again to prove the assholeness filled in your brain.“Yeah, that actually makes you a total pig compared to the girls I know. The most they ever eat is half a starter salad.”“That’s because they need to stay rail-thin so guys like you will find them attractive.”“There’s nothing attractive about a woman who’s all skin and bones.”Should I even say anything? People like them are responsible for skinny people feeling insecure with their bodies.“Women aren’t supposed to think, Wellsy. That’s why your brains are smaller. Science proves it.”Hehe very funny. Nice joke Garrett. You nailed it.“God, I can’t even be selfless without screwing it up.” He snickers. “It’s okay. At least you’re hot. And don’t get me started on your stripper tits.”G R E A T.I hate how girls in this book were represented. Like you HAVE to wear short clothes or show your boobs if you want a guy to like you.Also who the fuck does he think he is? YOU DON'T OWN A GIRL IF SHE BREAKS UP WITH YOU (or even when you are in a relationship). He fucking told everyone to stay away from Hannah? Agh this pissed me off so much.I liked Hannah but there were some things she said throughout the book which felt a little weird and insensitive. And before you say that I take things too seriously, all I would like to say is that internalized misogyny exists and I can't help but pointing it out.I'm telling you this book could have been way better if the author tried not to insert humour in places where it wasn't necessary. I still enjoyed the plot but the representation and stereotyping characters pissed me off a lot._______________Well fuck, the 1st book of this year turned out to be shit. But I'll try not to think about this jinxing the rest of my year.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'this is what internalized misogyny looks like'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""First read: May 2015Reaction: It was ok, nothing special.Second read: February 2016Reaction:THIS IS SO PERFECT I'M GONNA DIEConclusion:Dear Garrett Graham,I am so,sosorry for not appreciating your perfection the first time I readThe Deal. I strongly suspect that I was not ready to comprehend your otherwordly beauty, kindness and hotness. Perhaps the aforementioned hotness roasted my pathetic excuse of a brain. My heart, my body and my soul are yours. Please forgive me.It's true guys. After reading Dean and Logan's stories, I kept wondering why on God's green Earth I wasn't as excited aboutThe Dealas the rest of the world, why I thought it was just an average read and not a great NA romance so I decided to give it a second chance (yes yes I was supposed to be studying you don't have to remind me of that jeez). And I am glad I did. Because now I see. I see the light, I hear the birds sing, I smell the flowers,I feel the butterflies thumping in my stomach. And that's Garrett and Hannah's work.“Unbelievable. Every girl at this college would cut her frickin’ arm off to help me out. But this one? Runs away like I just asked her to murder a cat so we could sacrifice it to Satan.”I LOVE the Off-Campus boys.While Dean's story was the sexiest and Logan's the funniest, I think Garrett's was the mostheartwarming! Because there is not animal attraction or insta-lust that connects Garrett and Hannah at first. It's a deal,it's business that turns into friendship that turns into unconditional trust that turns into love and a parade of unicorns that shit strawberries and candy bars! Both of them arebrokenin their own way, they'redamagedbut together they salve their raw wounds, they find the strength to get out of their comfort zones and fight the nightmares that hold them back. Of course there isn't drama overdose and it's actually anamusing and steamy story, but I really appreciated the depth in them and understood the way their backround defined them.“How did I go so long without noticing you, damn it? Why did it take seeing a stupid A on your midterm to make me notice?”He sounds so genuinely upset that I scoot closer and kiss him. “It doesn’t matter. You know me now.”“I do,” he says fiercely.”UsingElle Kennedy's words, Garrettturned me into a mindless pile of mush!I giggled, I blushed, I sighed, I dreamed, I swooned, in other words I experienced every single fangirl symptom because of him!I liked Hannah very much, even though some of her decisions made my blood boil in a not particularly pleasant way and she broke my heart, but the general awesomeness of this book didn't let me stay mad at her for long! The way Hannah and Garrett bickered had melaughing my ass off, and their smexy scenes made medrool!“Fuck, I want to kiss her again. I want to feel her lips on mine. I want to hear that throaty noise she made the first time I sucked on her tongue.”Yum-my!*fans herself* Can you blame me for dreaming of hot hockey players?

It was such an enjoyable read and from the start I couldn’t put it down. It was sweet, sexy and funny and even a little emotional at times and it just made me smile.Despite the simple, not so original plot it was a refreshing read. Even if at first sight it's very similar with other college romances,“The Deal”was a captivating story from the start. Written in dual POV, which I really, really enjoyed, this NA is about two people, Hannah and Garrett who apparently are very different from each other, but as the story progresses they will find they are more compatible they have thought. In more ways than one.Hannah Wells is a 20 years old girl who's not very popular. She has some good friends and a supporting, loving family. Not many of her friends know about what happened to her five years ago. Despite her past, Hannah is not a broken girl. She wants to be ‘normal’, she has people in her life who care deeply for her, she has dreams. In most of the areas she’s a confident girl, but when it comes to relationships, sex and seduction she’s not the most experienced girl. Too bad since she has a crush on one of the football players.Garrett Graham is the captain of the hockey team. He’s very good looking, he’s popular and every female in the campus wants to be with him. He’s not popular only because of all that, but also because his father is a legend in hockey world. What no one knows is that Phil Graham is not as perfect everyone wants to believe.When Garrett gets an F at one of his courses he’s desperate to find a tutor. If he doesn’t pass the course he’ll be dropped by the team. When he finds out that Hanna got an A he proposes her a deal – she will tutor him in exchange for some helping regarding her crush. Hannah doesn’t want to have anything to do with this annoying cocky player, at least at first.“I’ve never met anyone who’s so repulsed by my popularity, and I have no idea what to make of it. I think I might like it.”Garrett knows that Hannah is the only one who can help him so he’s very, very persistent. They become some kind of friends, but one kiss changes everything between them.“Yes, Hannah and I are friends. In fact, she’s the only female friend I’ve ever had. And yes, I want to keep being Hannah’s friend. But…I also want to sleep with her.”What a breath of fresh air this one was! I really, really enjoyed it! I read many college romances and for me this was one of the best. Evn if the storyline is predictable, I enjoyed it. Both Hannah and Garrett were such endearing and relatable characters. They were not perfect. They have fears and insecurities and they felt real. Hannah is a great heroine. She’s smart, beautiful and sassy. Despite her past she’s a strong girl. She wants to have a normal, heathy relationship and she’s not as damaged as I expected her to be. I liked the fact that she wasn’t shy. She speaks her mind, she’s honest and she's caring. I found her a little annoying at times (in the beginning), but overall she was a great heroine.While I only liked Hannah, I loved Garrett. He made me smile and swoon. He was simply adorable! He’s cocky and arrogant, but he’s charming and loyal as well and I couldn’t stop falling for him. He’s sweet, caring and protective and he’s the perfect boyfriend. I loved the way he talks with Hannah and the way he is with her. And I also loved how ambitious he is.I absolutely loved their chemistry. To say that it was off the charts hot will be an understatement. You can really feel it from the beginning. Their slow-build relationship was very well done in my opinion. I just loved how everything progressed between them.I adored the banter between them and I loved all the sexual innuendos between them. They were so good together and perfect for each other. The witty dialogue was absolutely fabulous. I simply loved all their interactions.The side characters are pretty great too. And I’m talking about Hannah and Garrett’s friends. There’s some angst and drama, but don’t worry, they are low.The writing was flawless and engaging and the story was told in such a way that will make you be invested in this story from the start.All in all,“The Deal”was a fantastic read with two lovable well developed characters, captivating storyline and great writing. If you're a fan of college romances I totally recommend it!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'admito que me dio mucho cringe en ciertas partes, pero de que la pasé bien… la pasé más o menos JAJAJAJA'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5 stars!!“Sometimes people sneak up on you and suddenly you don’t know how you ever lived without them.”The only hockey romance that will ever be a five stars for me. Its not like a masterpiece or anything but it just so special to me because it was the first sports romance book that i ever read and what Hannah and grace had was so beautiful and amazing also besides that, Elle Kennedy wrote it so well like I was hooked from the start even when i was rereading it!It was one of those books that had a main plot but also two tiny subplots focusing on both the characters and their careers. It read like a 2000s romcom...you know those chick flicks and the ones that they dont make anymore and I miss it so fucking much. I loved how we got some ice hockey scenes because frankly I loved Garrett and his team + Hannah\'s conflict with her team was something that I enjoyed reading as well but what I loved the most was the tutoring trope AHHHHH its one of my favorite tropes and after reading this book I am pretty sure im going to be looking for them even more in books now. It was so perfectly written.“Just out of curiosity,” she says, “after you wake up in the morning, do you admire yourself in the mirror for one hour or two?”“Two,” I reply cheerfully.“Do you high five yourself?”“Of course not.” I smirk. “I kiss each of my biceps and then point to the ceiling and thank the big man upstairs for creating such a perfect male specimen.”GarrettfuckingGraham everybody! he made me laugh so much in this book. He is hands town in my top 10 book bfs of contemporary romance books. This man looked like a bad boy jock but really he was so caring. I loved how much he cared for Hannah and for his friends and the way he handled every Hannah situation was well done because excuse me? why does no one do it anymore...and what he did after the third act had me cackling because 🤣🤣 that scene itself was one if my favorites.“And the most important lesson I learned is that I’m not a victim—I’m a survivor.”Hannah Wells or as Garrett liked to call her Wellsy. Our FMC in the book, I would say she is not like other FMCs from other books but who am i kidding she is but that does not mean that I did not like her because I did. I loved her plotline, loved her dialogues, her interactions with Garrett a lot and how she fought with her past and became someone better but I guess that was the beauty of her character.“Living well and being happy is how we get over the shit in our past.”The whole gang: Logan, Dean, Tucker and Allie were hands down my favorite part about this book. They gave this book so much light and so much joy...I honestly would not have liked this book this much if they were not there.“Hey, come on, don’t cry,” he begs. “It breaks my fucking heart to hear you cry.”The romance between them was everything and I can say this a thousand time and it will still not be enough because it was literally everything. They both were a match made in heaven because I honestly dont know how that level of tension+care can be between them. The way Hannah was willing to give up just so Garrett could get everything and be happy and Garrett fighting for everything because he knew all he needed in his life was her to be happy just hit so hard.. and dont even get me started on hot this book was 🥵 that mouth on that man.Some of the banter between Garrett and Hannah (may contain mild spoilers):“You invoked a campus-wide hands-off law? Are you kidding me?” I’m not at all remorseful as I meet her eyes. “Of course I did.” “Oh my God. You are unbelievable.” She shakes her head in disbelief”“As you wish.”""Did you really just Princess Bride me?”“Did you really just use Princess Bride as a verb?”“Say it,” he orders. “Say what?” I use the corner of his blanket to wipe the moisture staining my cheeks. “Say Garrett Graham, you are a sex god. You have achieved what no other man ever has. You—” I punch him in the shoulder. “Oh my God, you’re such a jerk. I will never, ever say those words.” “Sure you will.” He smirks at me. “Once I’m through with you, you’ll be shouting those words out from the rooftops.”“Garrett tosses me the shirt. “Okay, get changed. We want to be fashionably late, not asshole late.”༊*·˚Pre-review༊*·˚Perfect book to break my HOFAS slump 😮\u200d💨.🤭 this book is my good luck charm because my sister made me a snack board and I got an A on my test 💅.Rereading this because this is IMO the best hockey romance ever written to this date and because i just love Hannah and Garrett so much!!(to my tbr im sorry keep waiting) :('}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""the wholefake dating to real datingisnt my favourite trope. usually because it deals with childish games, playing 'hard to get,' and making people jealous. im not a fan of those kind of dating tactics (maybe thats why im single) but this pleasantly surprised me.the highlight of this story is definitely the interactions and chemistry between hannah and garrett. their banter is relatable and i actually believed the feelings between them. it was so adorable to see how they grew into liking each other. i mean, the blurb doesnt do this story justice. i enjoyed how this went deeper than just fake dating - its actually a pretty solid story. maybe not the best writing out there, but quite entertaining.im looking forward to eventually continuing the series because i guess hockey bros are now my thing? lol.↠3.5 stars""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'No suelo leer este género (New Adult), pero gracias a este libro, lo empezará a hacer.En la primera parte de la saga #KissMe,Prohibido enamorarsenos encontramos la historia de Hannah y Garrett, cada cual con su pasado oscuro y sus metas en la vida. Personajes bien construidos, bien desarrollados y con los que consigues conectar gracias a páginas y páginas de monólogos internos, conversaciones sobre sus sentimientos y decenas de situaciones más. He agradecidomuchísimoque la autora se tomase el tiempo necesario para introducirnos los personajes y desarrollarlos en condiciones.Hay cosas que no me han gustado porque personalmente no las comparto, y supongo que es lo que ha hecho que las cinco estrellas no cuajen. De todos modos, no veo que esas cosas destaquen tan negativamente en este libro como en otros, pues hay ciertos mensajes muy positivos quejamáshe visto en novelas juveniles, y eso es un paso muy grande.El sexo es una parteMUYimportante de la novela. Hay muchas escenas de sexo durante todo el libro y están narradas al detalle: problemas para tragar el semen, de tamaños de órganos sexuales, complicaciones a la hora de la penetración... Es decir, detalles que se dan en la vida real contados con pelos y señales.¡Gracias, Elle Kennedy!Además, algo que me ha gustado mucho también es la importancia que el sexo tiene en la historia. No es un sexo injustificado, sino que forma parte de la trama y de las relaciones entre personajes.No soy fan de las películas, series o libros que se centren en deportes, y pensaba que esta novela iba a hablar demasiado del hockey... Pero no. Ni de coña. Se habla del deporte pero cuando hay partidos se comentan de pasada. (De nuevo, gracias.) La vida de Hannah era más interesante que la de Garrett porque se dedica a la música, y obviamente, me tira más.Otra cosa que me ha encantado es que cada uno de los protagonistas tiene su trama aparte del romance, es decir, que el romance no esLAtrama de la novela. Garrett tiene sus conflictos familiares, sus problemas por ser el capitán del equipo, los estudios... Y Hannah tiene conflictos con los ensayos de música, problemas familiares económicos... Y todo eso aderezado con escenas con sus amigos y de su día a día, han conseguido queProhibido enamorarsesea una novela muchísimo más profunda de lo que aparenta.Repito: no consumo NA. No pensaba que me iba a gustar, y aquí estoy,DESEANDOleer el siguiente libro. Cada uno nos narra una relación del grupo de amigos de Garrett, y el siguiente libro es Logan. ¡Logan! Tengo muchas ganas de ver qué ocurre...Me ha gustado muchísimo, muchísimo. Lo he leído muy rápido pese a la edición que tiene. El dinamismo que proporciona el que se narre desde los dos puntos de vista es maravilloso, y te da una sensación de conexión con los personajes increíble. Es una historia que engancha, una novela que te hace emocionarte y que te mantiene en vilo todo el rato.SUPER MEGA RECOMENDABLE.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '*****FIVE++++++++ STARS*****{BR with Mel, Dee, and Sharon}FREAKING LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!This book was freakingAMAZEBALLS, with a heaping side ofAWESOMESAUCE!!!! I don\'t think there are enough words in the English Dictionary to really express just howOVER THE MOON IN LOVEI am with this story!! This was utterlyUNPUTDOWNABLE! I usually take days to finish a book, but this one grabbed on to me so tight and wouldn\'t let go. It is the best of 2015 so far, for me. All I wanted to do was to find a way to dive into this book and live with all these amazing characters that Elle Kennedy created. Well, I\'d like to specifically take the place of Hannah so that I can have Garrett all to myself!!! Yes, my friends, I fell extremely hard for this man and he is going on myTOP TEN BBFlist!! I might have to add him to my GR name as well!!Hannah Wells and Garrett Graham both attend Briar University in Massachusetts. They are in the same Ethics class where Hannah was the only one to get an A- on the mid term, while almost 90% of the class, including Garrett, failed. Garrett has the chance to retake the mid term and must ace it in order to bring his GPA up, or he\'s off the Hockey team. Up until this point, neither of them have ever said one word to each other. Now Garrett is begging Hannah to tutor him. She is not like any of the other girls at school, because she\'s not falling all over herself to be near Garrett. He is""THE IT GUY""on campus as he\'s the Captain of the Hockey team and drool inducing HOT!! But, Hannah has eyes for another guy in school and when Garrett finds out, he offers to strike up a ""deal"". He\'ll pretend to be her boyfriend for a week, which will build up her reputation and land her the man of her dreams. In return, Hannah will have to tutor him so that he can get a better grade on the mid-term and remain on the hockey team. And later on a second ""Deal"" is in place between these two that will have your panties melting!!!So here is another story about a popular Jock getting involved with the shy and slightly nerdy girl at school. Both have issues from their past that are pretty serious but somehow they find that love they so desperately need from each other. Yea, I do believe I have read a few books like this,BUT, it didn\'t make me LOVE this story any less.I kiss her hard, losing myself in her taste and her heat and every damn thing about her. I never expected her. Sometimes people sneak up on you and suddenly you don\'t know how you ever lived without them. How you went about your day and hung out with your friends and fucked other people without having this one important person in your life.Garrett isINCREDIBLE!! The moment he was introduced in the story, I was a goner for him!! His quick and snarky comebacks to Hannah were hysterical. I lost count on the amount of times I cracked up due to the banter between the two of them.

I wanted to love this bookI really triedand find out what the hype is about it and Garrett Graham, but I didn’t find it at all😭 I think I started to really “like” this man after 70% of the book.────── ⋆⋅🤍⋅⋆ ──────❥Things I didn’t like:➴ this book and all its characters literally objectify women all the time.➴ this book = a literal definition of misogyny.➴ I didn’t feel the emotional connection between Garrett and Hannah. They had physical attraction and that’s it (at least for me). They shared their traumatic experiences, sure. But… idk. Besides, some smut took place after some “vulnerable” moments. It was like they didn’t how to process those moments or emotions in any other way. And the emotional scenes felt… empty.➴ I’m not even kidding when I tell you that Garrett compares EVERYTHING he does with Hannah to his experiences with other women. I get it. He’s a guy with a lot of experience and that’s fine. What was so annoying was the constant comparison.➴ the plot that Hannah was “broken” after her sexual assault and Garrett, of course, had to “fix her”. Uh? No further comments on that. I didn’t like how the author approached this sensitive topic.➴ Logan having a crush on Hannah? So weird. And Dean was a total asshole in this book.➴ an absolutely useless third act breakup. A lot of books have third act breakups and that’s okay. It’s part of the plot and character development. But in this book? USELESS. It’s like the author wanted to give us some angst but didn’t know how to do it properly, so she just created this dumbass situation.➴ the ending felt so abrupt. I thought I had some missing pages lmao.➴ I just finished this book literally a few hours ago and guess what? I’m already forgetting half of what I read. In a week it would be completely erased from my memory. Just saying.❥Things I liked:➴ this book was so bad (for me) that somehow turned out to be good enough to keep me reading it. I didn’t hate this book and it didn’t make me want to dnf it. If I’m being honest, I enjoyed it. Idk how this makes sense. If you know me, you should know that I’m not scared to dnf books. At the first sign that I’m not enjoying it at all, I just choose my happiness and leave the book behind. So, it was very entertaining- I can say that.➴ Garrett and Hannah had their cute moments. I liked it when they first met and became friends. They hung out a lot, studied, and watched Breaking Bad. I loved those moments.➴ … I have no idea what else.

It is amazingly written, is funny, it’s sweet, it’s romantic, it has enough angst (not much) and drama to keep us entertained, and I loved the banter between the MC’s and the whole “friends-to-lovers” premise.

The podcast has gone viral, yet Pip insists her investigating days are behind her.But she will have to break that promise when someone she knows goes missing. Jamie Reynolds has disappeared, on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth-year anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh.The police won't do anything about it. And if they won't look for Jamie then Pip will, uncovering more of her town's dark secrets along the way... and this time everyone is listening. But will she find him before it's too late?","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""FIVE FRANK-FREAKING-TASTIC, AMAZING STARS coming up!This series has truly educational purpose: especially last chapters of this book literally taught me how to speak Gibberish! I’m stunned, startled, speechless and numb. I loved the first book so much and as soon as I got my digital copy, I jumped up and down several times on the couch and broke it! ( Thankfully not my Ipad, I just broke my favorite couch! Shame on my over exaggerated excitement skills and too much sweet consumption during quarantine and chill times!)I was so happy to see Pip and Ravi back. After solving five years old cold case, acquitting Ravi’s brother Sal Singh’s honor and bringing justice for him and Andie Bell by finding the murderer, she was ready to talk and reach a bigger audiences about the progression of the events and her crime solving methods via podcast (thanks to Ravi, who named the podcast with series’ name)Now she’s sharing the details and interviews as Ravi resumes his court visits to pursue Max Hastings’ case who drug-rapped to many girls at the school including Nat who truly hates Pip right now because of being wrongly accused by her.When the life turns into its new normal routine and Pip promises herself not to get obsessed with any other case and live her life as a normal young adult (sweet 18 times!), attending the memorial of Sal and Andie, she finds herself dragged into Jamie Reynolds’ case: who is missing and his brother Connor who is also her high school friend needs her help to find him.Pip has no idea who 24 years old, outcast young man’s disappearance will bring out more terrifying secrets of town, fish netting online sites, secrets and Pip finds herself playing more dangerous game will bring her at the edge of tremendous breakdown because this time she took few more steps to the dark side and she may fall down from the cliff at any second. Even her loved ones and dear Ravi cannot help her this time.This was record time reading and at the beginning I thought the first book was a little better but when I reached to the last third, my mind was already blown away! My heart rate goes through the roof! I kept murmuring “Holly Sh*t” like a mantra several times and ending was epic, dazzling, dark, thought-provoking, volatile, phenomenal!Now I’m looking at the ceiling with a numb expression on my face and I can start screaming any time because the book is finished and I need more books of the series! I already missed the fast paced, nail biting, little hair lifter, excitingly delicious story telling. It’s addictive and I want more. I want it now. (Freddie Mercury’s song lyrics blaring in my ears!) I don’t know how I could wait for one more year! Give me patience Lord!I'm thanking myself and my husband's credit card for this copy! I bought it and I enjoyed every second of it. Highly recommended one of my favorite YA thrillers of the year!medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I made a promise. . . . I said I would never do this again, never play the detective, never again lose myself.Pip has sworn off solving mysteries for good. Now she's just following the trials from her one and only bout of sleuthing and updating her podcast with all the latest developments. But when a friend goes missing and the police refuses to do anything, Pip knows she'll have to step up again, even if it costs her everything.Sometimes I read a book, and it so far exceeds my expectations that I wonder afterwards if maybe I'd hallucinated. That's how I felt about the first book in this series. It was young adult, yet it was so smart, sharp, gritty, and utterly unputdownable. Now that I've read book 2, I know it wasn't just a fluke because it yet again exceeded all my expectations.I'm one of those people who grew up reading Nancy Drew (and The Hardy Boys, of course, but Nancy was my main jam). And so I'm always on the lookout, hoping some new, smart, spunky teen detective would pick up the mantle and delight me once again. And I've found exactly that in Pip.One of my favorite things about this series is the way the investigation unfolds. Clues are collected and followed up, which then leads to the next set of steps and clues. It's all very logical. And the dossier format of interviews, articles, maps, notes, etc. is so masterfully done that it feels like I'm in the middle of a real investigation.Just a word of warning: this isn't one of those mystery series you can read in any order you'd like. This book contains crucial information on the resolution of book 1, something I'm very thankful for because I have absolutely terrible book-memory. But it means you must read the books in order or risk being completely spoiled.As I'm getting older, I've noticed that I'm slowly outgrowing YA, but this series still speaks to me. Its mysteries and the way they expose the darkness of human nature, but also its cleverness and resourcefulness through its teen detective, appeals to all ages.

She even goes to speak with them herself, but the officers don't take her seriously. Jamie has disappeared before and they think he has just skipped town for a few days.Pippa can't ignore the signs, however, and they all point to foul play.Against her better judgement, she agrees to look into it. She can't deny a friend in need and sit by while Jamie may be in danger, or worse.As her investigation begins, she unearths a lot of secrets Jamie has been hiding. It's a wicked web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.This was such a fun story. It didn't quite capture me to the extent thatA Good Girl's Guidedid, but I think that's mostly attributable to first being introduced to Pippa in book one.In the initial book, I loved learning about her as a character. Meeting a girl who was willing to go outside of her comfort zone and risk everything in the name of truth and justice.Pippa definitely felt more mature in this novel, like an old friend. She still has that same fire inside her to discover the truth though. She's really a character you can get behind.The mystery was well-plotted and I absolutely adored the podcast elements incorporated throughout. Podcasts are definitely a popular plot device over the past couple of years and it felt very natural within this story.Holly Jackson has such a pleasing writing style.

Para mi sorpresa,Desaparición para expertosmantiene el nivel o incluso lo supera en algunas cosas respecto al anterior.Y mis cielas, creo que la Holly Jackson no es de este planeta.Empezaré dejando claro que sí,esta novela es una continuación.Parece que es un caso independiente, pero oooooh,vais a flipar.Sí que lo es en su mayoría, pero continúa con tramas abiertas que se mantienen de la primera entrega, y hacia el final todo va encajando.¿Os acordáis de una escena random del primer libro donde pasa una tontería que se desecha porque no tenía sentido? ¿O que en el primer libro X personaje le dice a otro una frase sin más?Pues queridas,TODO TERMINA ENCAJANDO.No me puedo creer que la autora plante las semillas de algunos sucesos con tanta antelación.EnDesaparición para expertostenemos justamente lo que nos dice el título:una desaparición.En un primer momento la protagonista decide no actuar, porque los hechos del primer libro casi le cuestan la vida.¿Pero sabéis qué es lo que adoro de Pip? Que va con todo. Se la suda todo el mundo y va al 200% a resolver sus casos.Y eso es lo que vemos en esta continuación. Ya no le van a amedrentar y va a conseguir las respuestas.En este caso el misterio parece más sencillo durante gran parte del libro, perova habiendo detalles que comienzan a hacerlo peliagudo.Como lector, algunos de los giros y tramas que se van desarrollando puedes ir intuyendo hacia dónde van a tirar, pero no, la autora juega muchísimo contigo y todo se convierte en otra cosa mucho más grande, temible y llena de sorpresas.Qué bien encajado todo, y sobre todo, qué bien narrado.Porque esa es otra...Holly Jackson esmuybuena escritora.El primer libro tenía una calidad increíble, pero creo que mejora en esta segunda entrega. El personaje de Pip adquiere aún más -si cabe- profundidad, yel estilo es impoluto. La autora maneja de forma espectacular las dinámicas entre personajes y los diálogos.Son tan entretenidos y bien pensados, reflejando en todo momento cómo son los personajes.Además, estilísticamente, hay momentos más que interesantes hacia el final (¡que me han encantado!).Respecto a cómo esta novela está planteada desde el punto de vista de maquetación,si en el primero teníamos entrevistas, artículos de webs, comentarios y demás, en esta ocasión llegamos incluso a tener fotografías REALES de los objetos del caso, mapas + todo lo anterior.Es una experiencia leer estos libros, porque sientes realmente el caso entre las páginas y puedes incluso observar los detalles de las fotografías o calcular tú mismo las distancias recorridas por la gente en los mapas.Y si hablamos del final...Al principio no estaba muy convencido de que la cosa fuera hacia ese camino, pero finalmente, en cuanto vi que la autora había planteado estas tramas de una forma casi oculta en el primer libro me quedé de piedra. Además,el final de este libro no solo resuelve la desaparición, sino que nos deja elementos muy importantes para la continuación, que creo que va a ser un cambio definitivo para esta saga.Estoy deseando leer el tercero... ¡Esperemos que la editorial no tarde demasiado en traerlo a España!En definitiva:Desaparición para expertoses unthrillerespectacular, con una protagonista determinada e inteligente, con un caso que se convierte poco a poco en algo más grande de lo que aparenta en un principio,y que no deja de sorprender y te mantiene en vilo desde el primer momento. Honestamente,esta saga es de los mejores misterios que he leído.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""ˏˋ°•*⁀➷・❥・“𝓢𝓸𝓶𝓮 𝓹𝓮𝓸𝓹𝓵𝓮 𝓪𝓻𝓮 𝓹𝓻𝓮𝓽𝓽𝔂 𝓰𝓸𝓸𝓭 𝓪𝓽 𝓱𝓲𝓭𝓲𝓷𝓰 𝔀𝓱𝓸 𝓽𝓱𝓮𝔂 𝓻𝓮𝓪𝓵𝓵𝔂 𝓪𝓻𝓮.”・❥・ˏˋ°•*⁀➷🎯04/02/24There are no other lines to describe this book the best than the above💌 There is so much I want to say but I'll keep this review short as this has been a long overdue review (I'm definitely solulu for not posting this soon😃).

Honestly, I feel violated, Holly Jackson called me stupid in at least 17 languages. There were so many twists and turns and I guessed NONE OF THEM. Usually when reading thriller/mystery, I have SOME IDEAS, now I had none lol. I was just trying not to get a heart attack. Actually, I had this one theory that I almost posted... so happy I didn't because BOY WAS I WRONG. Thriller is usually one of my favorite genres, but an aspect that it doesn't usually excel in is PROTAGONISTS you will root for. Detectives are usually weird, unlikeable, you don't understand the way they think, and they change from book to book. Here, that's not the case. Pip is your average girl, very smart, but she's just like you and me, she loves mystery but she's trying to lead a peaceful life (obv not trying hard enough). But, problems keep finding her. I feel like this is a huge part of the charm of this series (such a bad sentence). This book wasn't short, but I ATE IT UP. And it kept me hooked. I can't recommend this series (and this book) enough. I think it can work for anyone, even if you don't typically read this genre. It starts as this silly little school project and turns in this big bad dark monster. BUT IT DOES GRADUALLY, so you get to learn about the darkness of the world WITH PIP. BEAUTIFULBEAUTIFUL. It's executed so well also, there are so many formats within this book, interviews, articles, podcast files, pictures of evidence material, THAT COURT DRAWING... I GASPED.THE PLOT Have you heard? Pip is (in)famous in her town now. She launched the very first (and she hopes only) season of her podcast... as Ravi named it AGGTM (A Good Girl's Guide to Murder). While wrapping up the story, she's trying to live a normal life. Until her friend's brother goes missing. Police won't listen to Jamie's frantic brother and mother. But who will take the case seriously? Yes, Pip will.CHARACTERS You don't have to read this part, it's just me raving about how much I love these two.RAVI - THE BEST MAN. The definition of golden retriever boyfriend material. He's so supportive and wonderful. I wish we got more of him and Pip in this one, BUT I get why he wasn't that prominent. Sal's case of course affected him more and he had to spend a lot of time in court.PIP - THIS BARBIE IS MY FAVORITE DETECTIVE. I was on okay terms with her in the first book, BUT I FELL IN LOVE WITH HER IN THIS ONE. She's smart, meticulous, determined, kind, the best girl. I love her with Ravi, but as and individual as well. Can't wait for the show, casting department slayed.THIS SECTION IS FOR HOLLY: RELEASE THE PIPRAVI DATE SCENE NOW, I'M UNDER YOUR BED!!!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'M IN SHOCK RIGHT NOW.Okay, this is my favorite mystery of all time. The suspense, the careful pacing, the twists (yes, with an s), the realistic character development. How can it possibly be any better?Review to come...""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Due to all the obstacles she had to face and her family\'s insistence, Pip quit her detective job. Her podcast also had gone viral. Nothing in the world will bring Pip back to do investigative work again.But sometimes, in some exceptional cases where our intervention is inevitably needed, we will be forced to change our decision. Pip faces such a situation in her life when Jamie Reynolds suddenly disappears. Pip\'s initial thought was that the police would do whatever was necessary. But when she finds out that she will have to take the initiative to solve this case, Pip decides to restart her podcast and rekindle her investigative brain.What happened to Jamie? Why did he disappear precisely on the very same night the town hosted a memorial for the sixth anniversary of the deaths of Andie Bell and Sal Singh? Holly Jackson will answer these questions in this book.This sequel starts off somewhat slowly after the exciting investigative journey of Pip in the first book. The narrative pace quickly picks up and turns out more exciting than in the first book, especially during the central part of this novel. Even though this book deals with a few mature themes, it is pretty exciting to read after the initial 50 pages. The youngsters who are fond of mystery series books by authors like Enid Blyton, Hardy Boys, etc., are in for a treat here. But sadly, the author fails to maintain that pace during the latter part of the book, and the ending won\'t satisfy all the readers. Still, it is a decent book to read, like the first book, if you love to read books dealing with mysterious plots.What I learned from this book1) What will you do if someone you love calls you a waste of space or SOL (Space Occupying Lesion)?These are the worst words that you can call your loved ones. But unfortunately, there are still people who treat their loved ones like this. It can be your father, your partner, your friends, your colleagues, your boss, or even your children. We can see all the devastating consequences that such behavior can bring to your life in this book.Labeling and put-downs by parents or teachers are said to be the worst way to treat children.It is said that labels not just stick for life, but for generations. So please be careful when you think about calling your children a dummy or whether they suck at maths or science. If you are a grown-up individual but still staying with your parents or siblings, like Jamie in this book, and they are trying to devalue you by saying that you are useless, the first thing you should do is find a new place to live. You should stay away from them and contact them only when it is necessary and give a strict warning when they try to demotivate you. It doesn\'t mean to avoid your loved ones totally. But it is still better to keep a safe distance until they start to recognize your efforts and acknowledge your hard work. You should take charge of your life. It will be easier for you to succeed if you are surrounded by positive people instead of negative people.Holly Jackson is doing an amazing job of making people understand the nasty side effects of parents\' mistreating their grown-up children. She also indirectly says that there might be a history of bad parenting behind almost every unsuccessful person, and the insults and name-calling won\'t end even when their children have grown up and become adults.""Dad said, \'You\'re a waste of space.\'""2) Who are the people that you should be careful about?It is not the serial killers or the extreme psychos who try to physically hurt everyone in front of them that you should spend all your energy to avoid in your life. These people are few in number, and the probability of meeting such a person in your life is very rare. It is those silent killers who have personality disorders, who are sociopaths who emotionally shatter you, that you should be more careful about. The problem with them is that they are more in number now, and it is pretty tricky for an ordinary individual to understand whether the people they are talking with belong to this category. It is because they are pretty good at hiding their predatory traits and are walking amongst us as ordinary human beings.""Some people are pretty good at hiding who they really are.""Proper education and life experiences will help us to find out these silent predators.3) How far will the predators go for manipulation in court?This is one of those questions that many of you might have asked yourself after the famous case of two celebrity defamation cases in the US court in 2022. The mainstream media and the whole world were so obsessed with this case that every action of both parties was closely scrutinized by the public. The way one person tried to mirror the actions and dressing style of the other raised a lot of controversial debates. It was widely interpreted after the public reveal of borderline personality disorder and histrionic personality disorder by the psychologist that one celebrity was trying to manipulate everyone in the court, the opposite lawyer and his client, and even the judge.We can see how the author describes a similar situation in this book. (This book was published in 2020 before all these fiascos happened). Everything they used for manipulation, including expensive suits, fake glasses (fake glasses without any proper indication are always a red flag), and how they dressed, is well depicted by the author.""Yeah, that seems to be the image he and his lawyer have settled on. Expensive suit, fake glasses. Maybe they think his blonde, messy hair will be disarming to the jury or something.""My favourite three lines from this book""Hunches have to follow the evidence, that\'s how this works.""""What do you do when the things that are supposed to protect you, fail you like that.""""Everything\'s a clue until we discount it.""What could have been better?I believe that the latter half of this novel should have been dealt with in a better way by the author. The way the author introduced a different subplot after the twist in the latter half was a little unconvincing. Some of the readers might feel tricked by the author as she doesn\'t initially give sufficient clues that connect with the subplot after the twist reveal. That feeling will be greater, and the reader will feel forcefully pushed to a parallel new story if we do a retrospective analysis of the novel after we finish reading it.The whole vandalizing episode was dealt with extremely immaturely and casually compared to the rest of the book. Just because someone did something wrong doesn\'t give you the license to take the law into your hands and do anything to them and their relatives. Either the author should have avoided the whole vandalizing episode or dealt with its aftermath in a more mature manner.Rating4/5Despite all the negatives I mentioned above, this book will still be a decent choice for you if you loved reading the first book in this series.—————————————————————————You can also follow me onInstagram ID - Dasfill|YouTube Channel ID - Dasfill|YouTube Health Channel ID - Dasfill - Health|YouTube Malayalam Channel ID - Dasfill - Malayalam|Threads ID - Dasfill|Twitter ID - Dasfill1|Snapchat ID - Dasfill|Facebook ID - Dasfill|TikTok ID - Dasfill1'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': "": ̗̀➛4 stars☆“some people are pretty good at hiding who they really are.”god that ending really fucked me up. ngl i did get teary eyed and a few tears may or may not have escaped.And she checked, down inside herself, under her skin, but she couldn’t find it.

And he jumped with her, hand in hand, into even her wildest conclusions. They just worked like that, teased out the best in each other, knowing when to talk and when to just be there.”confession:i started this book bc i wanted to see ravi again. they are constantly on my mind even after reading the books. they make my heart burst with joy because they were so beautifully written. this book delivered with all the scenes that he was in! the way they describe their interactions and how pip glowed anytime she was with ravi was so heartwarming to read about. i really need a ravi singh in my life. you’re telling me they said i love you in the rain and kissed?? i’m not going to be available for the foreseeable future bc i’ll be too busy crying about them.that being said, the small scenes where he played a bigger role than pip’s boyfriend broke my heart. the way he connected to the case and had hope were so saddening to hear about when the realization of what it means to him hits. it felt as though every presence he made in this book was deliberate and i loved him so much. the way he tried his best to be there for pip and put up with her outbursts while staying with her throughout it was so sweet. i’m never getting over themthe only flaw was that the friendships within this book were disappointing. the true colors were revealed within this book and even though i expected ant and lauren to be bitches, i did not expect connor to be so shy and a pushover. he was constantly annoying pip and never listened to her advice and i tried my best to sympathize with him but it became hard to. especially since he became sort of a constant character who helped pip along this journey. not to mention the way he wouldn’t stand up for himself when his friends accused them of lying yet he knew the truth?? he was probably the only downside to reading this book, along with max hastings. the only friendship i liked was pip and cara’s. they stayed good friends throughout the book and understood each other.this book was so funny at times. it felt like the perfect mix of everything combined into one which i loved. it would shift from funny to creepy and keep me on my toes all the same. the small banter was everything with pip and ravi and their small little ways of communicating were both adorable and hilarious at the same time. i hope they never lose their humor and their love. this book never lost my interest and i loved practically everything about this book.“I’m sorry. I feel guilty all the time, so I don’t need you to tell me. I’m the expert on my own mistakes. I understand.”“She hadn’t almost lost herself, maybe she’d actually been meeting herself for the very first time. And she was tired of feeling guilty about it. Tired of feeling shame about who she was.”“She wanted just to be the Pip she was with Ravi for a while. But that Pip wasn’t here right now. And maybe she really was gone.”“I think we all get to decide what good and bad and right and wrong mean to us, not what we’re told to accept. You did nothing wrong. Don’t beat yourself up for other people’s mistakes.”spoilers from this point on!pip went through so much in this book. it felt as though she’d never catch a break because as soon as she felt she understood who she was, something happens that completely changes her and she loses herself again. she deserves so much after everything and i’m still in disbelief after everything that she experienced. the scene between nat da silva and pip and how they cried together and bonded?? i found it to be so emotional and painful after everything that happened and how max hastings never got what he deserved. there’s something about the way holly jackson portrays the emotions of a character that really hits me.the ending was like an emotional roller coaster. it was like one plot twist after another and i started bawling at the ending. i thought that it was genius to build off something that happened in the first book and center around it. i shed so many tears for stanley and what he experienced bc he never wanted to be like his father but suffered the consequences and lost all his friends in the process. it was disappointing how no one realized he was just a kid and regretted his mistakes. i wish he had a better death scene. he was so kind and realizing the person he truly was was so saddening. the fact that they wrote“You were better”on stanley’s grave made me sob uncontrollably.honestly i did NOT expect charlie to be the catfish. the way he knew that pip messaged him through connor’s account? literal chills. it’s hard to sympathize with both stanley and charlie but i understand both sides. it was so sad how stanley accepted his fate and tried protecting pip when she tried to defend stanley. i hope charlie appears in the final book and we get to find out once and for all what will happen. it felt as though jamie only played a small part in everything that went down in this book. stanley turned out to be such a good character trying to live a normal life who was never really able to escape his past mistakes.i hope we find out more about max after everything. i’m so proud of pip for what she did and facing the consequences so he would face the consequences also. the way max smiled at pip and ravi when he spotted them?? it was so confusing but i’m glad ravi put him in his place. i hated him so much in this book for everything he’s made everyone suffer through and he has the audacity to post a photo celebrating after being found not guilty. it disgusts me that he gets to be free but i appreciate the realistic aspect of this.ˏˋ°•*⁀➷kill joy - 2.5 starsa good girl’s guide to murder - 4.25 starsgood girl, bad blood - 4.75 starsas good as dead - 4.5 starspre-reviewi’m still sobbing over that ending. rtc if i can ever pull myself together 🥲'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2.75!❝I don't have to be likeable.

Still weak. And in a thriller, plot is king.I stayed up all night reading this one (thanks to my girl Bruna for staying awake with me and indulging my wild conspiracy theories), and while I wanted to give it a lower score, I ended up sticking with 2.75 because, well... the characters saved it just a little. But here’s the thing: I guessed 60% of the plot, and it wasn’t fun. At all. And yeah, I blame myself for having “detective mode” permanently switched on, but still.➷**Where’s the Creepy Vibes?**This trilogy promised me chills, but I’m still waiting to get spooked. The second book? Just as bland as the first when it comes to scariness. Sure, this one leaned more into character development, which some people might vibe with, but for me?Plot >>> everything. If the story doesn’t slap, it’s a miss.The thing is, if you’re not the kind of person who reads thrillers with a magnifying glass and Sherlock Holmes-level deductions, the plot might work for you. But me? I can’t help it—I’m piecing everything together before the author even gets there.➷**The Theories I Got Right**From the vault of my Notes app, here’s a little flex session about my predictions:1. [Jamie’s gonna get involved in something sketchy]Duh. He was practically invisible in book one. ✅2. [Jamie’s being manipulated by someone shady online.]Called it. Low self-esteem + the internet = red flags. ✅3. [Max is gonna dodge jail time, but book 3 will focus on him.]First part? Yep. ✅Second part? TBD—I’m going into book 3 blind.4. [Child Brunswick = Stanley.]This one? Plsss it was So obvious. ✅Basically, I nailed it. But the downside? It totally ruined the suspense for me.➷**Character Rundown**Pippa: Okay, hear me out—Pip surprised me in this one. She’s still kind of predictable and plays into some repetitive tropes, but I feel like I’m growing up alongside her. She’s maturing emotionally and mentally, and I’m rooting for even more growth in book 3. She might just pull through as a solid character by the end.Ravi: Oh my god, this guy. Ravi is the MVP. The way he cares about Pip? The support, the teamwork, the fact that he’s always documenting stuff and showing up for her—it’s all so wholesome. They’re the couple you want to root for, and his “lift you up when you’re down” energy is everything.Stanley: This man needs an apology from the whole world. Like Sal, he carried guilt for something that wasn’t his fault, and it crushed him. The way Pip handled revealing the truth? A solid moment. He deserved that vindication, and my heart genuinely broke for him.➷**Final Thoughts**The character development was the only thing keeping this book afloat for me. The rest was just... meh. I really hope book 3 comes through with the vibes and delivers on all the tension and creepiness this trilogy promised but hasn’t quite delivered yet.

SO MANY UNANSWERED QUESTIONS.EVEN THE LASTSENTENCEFREAKED ME OUT!!!! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE??!!!The story picked up a few weeks afterA Good Girl's Guide to Murder. The day after the memorial of Sal and Andie is when new trouble starts—Connor Reynold's older brother, Jamie, has gone missing and the police aren't doing anything about it because he's an adult & that behavior is not unusual for him. Sooooo even though Pip before promised to never go back intoDetective Mode, she's going to have to break that promise to save Jamie—though this time, she says she'll be 'more careful'. Oh and also during the book, the trial for Max Hastings (How I despise him) is going on to prove whether he's guilty or not, but I mean it's super obvious what verdict should be-I love how Pip created her own podcast named after the title of the first book, AGGGTM. And Ravi was the one who came up with it LOL.‘OK . . .’ He chewed his lip and it made Pip’s stomach tighten. ‘So, something murder, or kill or dead. And you are Pip, who’s a student and a girl who’s good at . . . oh shit,’ he said suddenly, eyes widening. ‘I’ve got it!’‘What?’ she said.‘I’ve literally got it,’ he said, far too pleased with himself. ‘What is it?’‘A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder.’‘Noooo.’ Pip shook her head. ‘That’s bad, way too try- hard.’Of course Pip didn't like it, but she relented with the name anyways😌Speaking of Pip & Ravi, their relationship wasthebest. Though Ravi didn't appear as much as he did in the first book ('cause he had to attend Max's trial), he was super supportive whenever he was around Pip. Especially since Pip still had some trauma from the first book and was having a hard time dealing with what happened in Andie Bell's case. Ravi always tried to be there for her and not decide things for her. He understood her and never tried to be controlling.To sum it all up ----> Ravi is thesweetest🥺🥰And while Pip is trying to understand herself and all that's happened the past few months, Charlie (the new neighbor) gives like one of the best speeches I've ever heard that really helped Pip:‘Oh, justice exists,’ Charlie said, looking up at the rain. ‘Maybe not the kind that happens in police stations and courtrooms, but it does exist. And when you really think about it, those words – good and bad, right and wrong – they don’t really matter in the real world. Who gets to decide what they mean: those people who just got it wrong and let Max walk free? No,’ he shook his head. ‘I think we all get to decide what good and bad and right and wrong mean to us, not what we’re told to accept. You did nothing wrong. Don’t beat yourself up for other people’s mistakes.’Okay now that I've said that I don't think I can go on without giving away any spoilers soooo.......SPOILERS START HERE:You have been warned..............STANLEY.😭😭😭MAX.🤬🤬🤬CHARLIE.😫😨🤯THOSE 3 ARE THE ONES THAT KEEP ATTACKING MY THOUGHTS.First of all.....STANLEY FORBES (aka Child Brunswick)😭😭I'M SORRY STANLEY.

(He didn't have Jamie --->that was Stanley (long story), BUT Charlie started all of this and was the catfish -Layla Mead)AND CHARLIE KILLED STANLEY.Although, I can understand why he was angry and killed Stanley (Charlie's sister was one of the victims of the Brunswick murders)he still shoudn't have killed Stanley.STANLEY WAS10WHEN ALL THESE MURDERS HAPPENED. IT WAS HIS FATHER'S FAULT,NOT STANLEY.Still, I actually don't hate Charlie.Oh no, I have all that hate towardsMax Freaking Hastings.🤬And then you have the book ending with Pip being even more traumatized then before since she literally watched someone (Stanley) die right in front of her. Oh Pip :(.....SPOILERS END HERE!!!One more thing before I end this:I'm like really, really,reallypissed off at Ant and Lauren. They're supposed to be Pip's friends, but instead throughout the whole book you see them acting like complete jerks to the point where they thinkthis whole investigation is a JOKE???

Even though she got suspended for 3 days, it was SO WORTH IT.Oh and Pip spray painting and breaking the windows of Max's house WASA M A Z I N G.I love this new Pip😍🤩In the next book, I better be seeing the revenge I'm waiting for.🔥🔥LET'S GOOOO PIP & RAVI|Blog|""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Simply put: Pip meets true crime4.5 starsSimilarly toAGGGTM,this took me on such a wild ride when things started unraveling as they did. The plot twists were real twisty and my mind was running in circles with the clues given and suspense taking place. Essentially once someone came into the picture, I just kept questioning, who tf were they?! It was making my brain hurt. although, I did manage to narrow down my suspects and ended up being right about them and wasn’t mad at it but otherwise still like 🫨Unlike the first book, the first 25% here felt fairly slower to me but it picked up immediately after. if I had the time and energy, I could’ve easily binged the last 75% with how well crafted it was all set up to be. I loved the addition ofthe podcastas it gave it a true crime feel besides the storyline. It also felt impossible not to draw the same connections as pip did—almost felt like our minds were threaded lol“But that wasn't it, was it? She hadn't almost lost herself, maybe she'd actually been meeting herself for the very first time. And she was tired of feeling guilty about it. Tired of feeling shame about who she was.”Aside from the mystery being entertaining, this book was also moreemotionally charged.Solving crime as an amateur detective clearly isn't easy as Pip had to handle the pressures and challenges that came with that(again, a suspension of disbelief is needed here even though the scenario is likely with how complex the CRJ system is)while also balancing her personal life. As a result, she was a bit reckless and a bit unhinged but to me she was trying her best to keep it together as she dealt with theInjustice of all that transpired.it was honestly kinda sad what happened in the middle and at the end.Reiterating this again but Pipravi? Love them 🥹 I wish we got more of Ravi but I did enjoy him riling up pip and the moments he was there for her. I fully believe we were robbed of more so i hope the adaption gives us that and i cannot wait to see what’s next for them both and seeing a certain someone getting what they deserveShout out to Jess for letting me spam her with my theories and gaslighting me in the process.“But the smile broke eventually, and Ravi drew back.

Holly Jackson seems to outdo the first book and I am simply amazed (no, it is not possible). This is probably one of the best murder-mystery novels I've read in a long time and I'm so glad it failed to disappoint me (disclaimer: I've been disappointed a lot by the middle book syndrome). But Holly Jackson literally said: SIKE, YOU BET!The author managed to keep me guessing and stay for the truth. There were so many twists and turns that worked very well with the plot developments. I remember pointing out in the first book that all the clues felt rather coincidental and merely luck. However, Pippa truly proves herself over and over that she has what it takes to be a true investigator.This book offered another kind of format that is still well organized and written. Holly Jackson lured me back into Pip's story with a great opening line and a deftly constructed synopsis of the events of the last book. As the number of suspects expands and secrets, lies, and false identities are uncovered, the plot moves at a very fast pace. A total page-turner.And to see Pippa and Ravi again was my ultimate goal in continuing this. We get to see the romance without it taking away the overall suspenseful atmosphere of the book. It was just a bummer that Ravi's presence felt less significant in this one as it focuses more on Jamie (a brother to Pippa's friend). I don't mind me more Ravi (ノ^∇^)I was also definitely surprised with the revelation, despite the suspicion. And as much as I enjoyed it, it feels a bit underwhelming(probably because it involves new people in the town so I don't find myself feeling connected, considering a little establishment to the culprit's backstory as compared to the first book).Nevertheless, this is another success from Holly Jackson. Good Girl, Bad Blood is bewildering, intense and dark. I couldn't wait to start the last book (gonna miss Pippa, I just know).[4.5/5]""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""⭐2.5Ehhhhh I didn't care for it and I am so disappointed.I really loved A Good Girl's Guide to Murder and this had similar podcast/interview elements I enjoyed so much. But it lacked Pip's tenacity and grit. Pip felt washed out and bland. She depressed me to be honest. I know the character was tired but it felt overdone.The mystery of the missing brother was lackluster at best for the first 2/3's of the novel. Then the twists started coming and they didn't stop coming. And they were insane (I mean that in a bad way, if it wasn't obvious). Completely left field. Nothing anyone could have predicted or even imagined. I did not like the ending at all.I think this book is probably suffering from middle-book syndrome. It felt very episode-of-the-week.I am still interested in picking up the third book however. I have hope for this storyline.""}]"

Due cuori in affitto

Blake ne ha quasi trentatré ed è un vero newyorkese. Lei aspira a diventare una sceneggiatrice di successo, ma per ora è solo assistente del direttore di produzione di una serie tv. Lui è uno scrittore da svariati milioni di copie e i suoi bestseller sono sempre nella classifica dei libri più venduti. Summer è fidanzata con un uomo molto più grande di lei, mentre Blake è single per vocazione. Lei è una persona ordinata, precisa e mattiniera, fa yoga e beve tè verde; lui fa colazione con un Bloody Mary e due sigarette, vive nel caos e non si sveglia mai prima delle due del pomeriggio. Summer e Blake non hanno proprio niente in comune, a parte una casa delle vacanze negli Hamptons, che per un mancato passaggio di informazioni è stata affittata a entrambi. Qualcuno se ne deve andare, ma tutti e due hanno ottime ragioni per restare. E le ragioni potrebbero aumentare con il passare dei giorni…","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'Oh, Blake.Sapevo che non mi avresti delusa.A livello di scrittura ho apprezzato di più Ti aspetto a Central Park, ma per quanto riguarda la trama questo vince a mani basse. L’ho cominciato ieri alle 23:30 e ora sono le 23 e, nel caso non si fosse capito, sto scrivendo la recensione.Ieri sera, mentre stavo per afferrare l’ennesimo libro imposto per lavoro (non fraintendetemi, li scelgo io e sono libri che non vedo l’ora di leggere, ma che sono carichi di deadline, il che non rende l’esperienza di lettura piacevole al 100%. Scelgo cosa leggere, ma non in che ordine o quando), ho guardato Giuliano e gli ho detto: “sai cosa? Ora scelgo qualcosa per me. Qualcosa che non avrei assolutamente tempo di leggere e non dirò nulla a nessuno finché non lo finisco, altrimenti mi sento in colpa. Le conseguenze le affronterò un altro giorno” e, senza pensarci un attimo ho tirato fuori dalla libreria Due cuori in affitto. Sono così contenta di averlo fatto. Nessun obiettivo, nessun progetto che mi spingesse a finirlo in fretta. Solo un capitolo dopo l’altro, mossa dalla sola voglia di vedere Blake e Summer insieme. No, non ero curiosa di sapere come sarebbe finito perché credo fosse ovvio nelle prime 50 pagine, ma io volevo arrivare al loro lieto fine e basta.Ok, va bene, a tratti è tanto mieloso, ma a me questo libro è piaciuto proprio tanto.Sono ufficialmente pronta per Innamorati Pazzi, in uscita tra 10 giorni.E, per l’amor del cielo, qualcuno dica alla editor di Kingsley che la lasci scrivere anche 200 pagine in più.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Le mie prime 5 stelle per un romance sono state giustamente conquistate da Blake e Summer in “Due cuori in affitto”.La storia contiene tutti i classici ingredienti apprezzatissimi nel genere: forced proximity, enemies to lovers, scrittore in blocco e protagonista femminile in un momento di ascesa professionale.I trope noti sono mescolati con maestria per creare scene originali e mai scontate.Il risultato è ovviamente un libro che si “beve” in poche ore (come un Bloody Mary) 😏'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Il libro è carino,scritto bene,piacevole e divertente ...l'unico appunto non positivissimo lo faccio alla troppa paradossalita'di alcune scene..in pratica delle situazioni le avrei evitate,e collegandomi a una di esse mi viene da chiedere,ma Felicia che fine ha fatto Dwight?sono preoccupata...spero stia bene visto l'enorme casino in cui si era infilato,non ci sono state piu sue notizie fino alla fine...!hai deciso di abbandonarlo al suo destino?😉""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'It’s so bad I want to give you a zero, but I can’tHo letto questo libro perché sul Booktok ho visto recensioni estremamente positive (geniale! divertente! spicy!), e NON mi capacito del perché: forse ho letto un libro diverso?Il problema del romanzo non è tanto la banalità della trama quanto la sua elaborazione: situazioni e dialoghi del tutto irrealistici, personaggi incoerenti e luoghi non delineati.

Cominciamo col dire che l autrice mi ha chiesto una collaborazione tempo fa quindi io sto rispondendo ad una richiesta e visto che voleva una mia sincera e lapidaria opinione eccola!Ho ascoltato codesto libro su Audible e devo dire che col doppio pov hanno usato die narratori cosa che ho apprezzato e forse questa è l unica cosa positiva.Questo libroide è un film degli anni 90 e ne ha tutti i meccanismi e clichè ( si ho detto clichè) ma fatto male perché tende a scimmiottarlo. La trama e questi due che insieme non fanno un neurone che per forze sconosciute devono stare insieme nella stessa casa per un tot di tempo. I presupposti sono buoni ma il modo in cui sti due stanno insieme PER FORZA non c ha senso come non c ha senso il fatto che lui che c ha una paccata di soldi non se può andare PERCHÈ GUARDA CASO È TUTTO OCCUPATO. Ma dove siamo a Rimini durante la notte rosa?? Poi lei non lo sopporta però devo stare in questa casa perché lo vuole il destino!!Ok..La trama è intervallata da momenti di comicità che non fanno ridere neanche i polli..lo scopino del water usato come arma?? Il peto?? Ma seriamente ?? Siamo alle medie che devo ridere per una scoreggia?? Mi han detto che questa è una comicità da cinepattone e io vi dico che li almeno è una comicità becera ma studiata qui di studiato non c'è nulla perché non l'autrice non ha saputo scrivere scene comiche, anzi. Consideriamo anche che la comicità è soggettiva quello che fa ridere me non fa ridere voi ma qui siamo proprio a livello de LA FAMIGLIA DEL PROFESSORE MATTO dove c'è una scena dove tutti scoreggiano e già li non faceva ridere figuriamoci qui.I personaggi.Meravigliosamente insopportabili. Estate è la classica donna anni 90 che senza di lui non sa fare nulla e le vengono affibiate delle caratteristiche anzi delle etichette : salutista, vegetariana, fa yoga ma non la vediamo mai far nulla di tutto questo ..scialba, antipatica isterica classica protagonista anni 90.. ah tra l altro lei fa la sceneggiatrice ma quando c'è lui non sa fare più nulla, non parliamo poi della classica scena che si vedrebbe in qualsiasi film dei quegli anni dove lei prende il nastro adesivo e divide la casa. Non parliamo poi della sua incoerenza nei confronti del fidanzato e delle scelte finali.Lui un coglione troglodita che ce l'ha d'oro che deve denigrare tutto e tutti e udite udite fa lo scrittore ma si comporta come un divo di Hollywood.. certamente... scrive bestseller e deve denigrare lei perché scrive sceneggiature e quindi è una fallita..come dire che King va a denigrare una scrittrice di libri per bambini.. uguale.. infatti si parla di due contesti diversi, di due forme di comunicazione diverse quindi non si possono mettere a paragone , ma questo dimostra che lui non ha un neurone nel cervello ovviamente per non parlare poi del fatto che è lui che salva il sedere a lei perché lei accecata dal suo pene dorato non sa fare più nulla...e non capisco onestamente come tutte si siano sciolte davanti a codesto troglodita..solo per le scene finale ? Seriamente?? Il suo personaggio è ispirato, da quanto ho saputo , allo scrittore di una serie tv, dove si parlava appunto di uno scrittore che ha scritto un bestseller ma che il film da cui è stato tratto , è stato un flop. Il problema è che li il personaggio era costruito bene e aveva anche delle situazioni equivoche soft zozzo divertenti qui non c'è nulla di tutto questo. Se ti vuoi ispirare ad un personaggio fai in modo che sia credibile perché se no anche in questo caso è uno scimmiottare.L'evoluzione dei due personaggi e del loro rapporto è pari a quella che si vede in un rom com anni 90, perché siamo rimasti li con la nostalgia canaglia, ma li siamo in un film e ci sta che repentinamente i due cambino ma qui siamo in un libro e direi che dovresti darmi qualcosa in più. Tra l'altro c'è tanta forzatura nel finale che fa salire la glicemia inutilmente. Non c'è evoluzione solo piattumeIl rapporto tra i due non è minimamente centrale ai fini della trama cosa che si poteva approfondire meglio però si è optato per le scenette comiche che ce le potevamo risparmiare.. loro due si battibeccano come se fossero all'asilo Mariuccia , su cose assolutamente futili , come il lavoro che ripeto non sono da paragonare le due cose e il fatto che lui deve rimarcare il fatto che è un troglodita ovviamente per non parlare poi delle situazioni posticcie e ridicole che vengono create per far in modo che sti due stiano insieme..un peccato perché avrei voluto vedere proprio la trama incentrata sul loro rapporto e sulla loro evoluzione. Invece no. Meglio le scorrege.I personaggi secondari sono ridicoli e vorrei soffermarmi su quanto è stato fastidioso vedere la solita bionda svampita che urla come un'oca giuliva, la domestica sudamericana, e i Narcos messicani ... poi mancava il ristorante italiano con la tovaglia a quadri e avevamo tutti gli stereotipi anni 90..ma io dico possibile che non riusciamo ad andare oltre il concetto di bella ma scema e inutile perché il personaggio della Bambolona non è funzionale alla trama.. è una stupida e basta. Ma voi come vi sentireste se vi rappresentassero in questo modo? Io credo che sia altamente offensivo. Questo era un aspetto tipico degli anni 90 ma ci siamo evoluti o no ? E la domestica sudamericana che non parla americano ?? Ma per favoreIl fidanzato di lei non la tocca da mesi quindi non sei un vero uomo perché devi essere uno sperminator ovviamente e spesso e volentieri il nostro CELODOR lo denigra.. boh va be..I parenti di lei utili come il ghiaccio nel Sahara.. ma ci sta perché se i due protagonisti non sono ben caratterizzati figuriamoci i secondari. Non parliamo del loro rapporto e di quello che succede perché veramente ... dico solo che prendere a sprangate lei sul muso sarebbe stata cosa buona e giusta.Ma la cosa che mi ha fatto cascare tutto quello che mi poteva cascare è l'insulsa , inutile e becera reference a CALIFORNICATION ma era proprio necessario scrivere paro paro la scene della chiesa, che è l'inizio della serie ?? Cioè vuoi citarla ok ma almeno cambia titolo.. no proprio para para..io a quella scena non sapevo se ridere o piangere.Le scene zozze forse sono la cosa più penosa ma decente rispetto a questa cozzaglia di parole messa insieme su carta e per fortuna carta riciclata.Capisco che questo libro possa piacere ad un pubblico molto più giovane di me però non riesco a capire cosa vi è piaciuto di Blake.

Letto in un periodo di blocco totale, in cui i romance mi sono sembrati l\'unica strada possibile per rimettermi in carreggiata con le varie letture, ""Due cuori in affitto"" si è rivelato di una banalità e di una scontatezza davvero esasperanti. Solitamente sono più che propensa ad uscire dalla mia comfort zone e il più delle volte lo faccio con le migliori intenzioni, ma in questo caso la storia di Summer e Blake mi ha fatto venire il latte alle ginocchia. Lei, inizialmente infelice e frustrata, dalla personalità piatta e odiosa, sempre a piangersi addosso e a farsi trasportare dalla corrente di due parole dolci, messe lì per caso da qualcuno che conosce appena. Lui, uomo palesemente scritto da una donna, che da manuale sembra trovare le frasi giuste per ogni occasione e riesce a carpire i suoi pensieri più nascosti e intimi, corrispondendo all\'ideale del bello e maledetto che tanto fa impazzire le donne (ma dove li avete mai trovati questi soggetti?)Mi dispiace ma per me è un no grande quanto una casa, tutto troppo prevedibile e fastidioso persino nella trama, dove la love story in questione ha modo di svilupparsi tra scenette quasi comiche che sfociano nel ridicolo.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5⭐️«Mi sei entrata dentro, Summer Hale.

I proprietari della villa, attualmente in corso di separazione, hanno entrambi affittato la villa senza avvisarsi e, ciliegina sulla torta, il fidanzato di Summer non è altri che il critico letterario / hater che affossa ogni volta i romanzi di Blake!Come inizio direi che non c'è male, vero?Se alla parola “fidanzato” avete attivato l'allarme triangolo (io non li reggo, sorry!) potete stare abbastanza tranquille. La palla al piede che lei definisce fidanzato (capirete perché lo chiamo così) si eclissa abbastanza in fretta, così come l'accompagnatrice di Blake.Questo significa che Summer e Blake dovranno provare a rendere sopportabile quella convivenza obbligata, d'altronde negli Hamptons non si trova un buco libero in alta stagione!La Kingsley ci intrattiene alla grande con situazioni imbarazzanti, frecciatine a non finire e quella tensione sessuale che adoro nelle commedie romantiche.Agognavo sul serio il fatidico primo bacio tra Summer e Blake, quella è sicuramente una delle mie scene preferite del libro!Entrambi i protagonisti mi sono piaciuti, ho un debole per gli scapoli incalliti come Blake che cambiano quando incontrano la donna giusta, ed ho apprezzato la tenacia di Summer nell'inseguire quella che è la sua più grande passione, quando potrebbe invece lavorare nello studio di papino e non essere più considerata la delusione della famiglia.Il mondo di Hollywood però è quello che è, Summer è una donna e pure l'ultima arrivata, dovrà perciò fare i conti con alcune situazioni spiacevoli.Nella storia compare anche qualche personaggio secondario decisamente bizzarro in grado di assicurarci qualche bella risata!Summer e Blake sono una coppia affiatata e ben riuscita, la crescita del loro rapporto mi ha totalmente conquistata, grazie anche alla situazione odio-amore con cui io ho un feeling particolare e che la Kingsley è bravissima nello sviluppare.Non mancano i passi falsi e i fraintendimenti di rito a tenerci in sospeso fino alla fine, la lettura è ricca di imprevisti e situazioni diverse ed è come sempre molto scorrevole e coinvolgente.Bravissima Felicia, anche questa volta il tuo romanzo mi è piaciuto davvero tanto!Romanzo consigliato a chi cerca una bella commedia romantica estiva e ironica, da gustarsi possibilmente in compagnia di un cocktail con l'ombrellino!Punto di vista: prima persona, alternatoSensualità: tensione sessuale, scene hot softCaratteristiche: commedia romantica, estiva, ironicaStile narrativo: scorrevole e coinvolgenteTipo di finale: auto-conclusivo""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Trama/Plot ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Personaggi/Characters ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Stile/Style ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Spicy ⭐⭐Prende 5 stelle perché comunque la storia è sempre divertentissima, i personaggi grandiosi e l'intreccio molto divertente.

I also took - and read - the limited edition for two reasons, I didn't have the paperback and there are bonus chapters: now I have the paperback, the bonus chapters...well, what can I say, they don't add anything new to the development of the plot nor to the characterization of the characters, they are neither exaggeratedly entertaining nor useful to the development of the novel. I imagine they were chapters already written initially and then cut by the editor and agent for space reasons.******Rilettura di uno dei primi romance della Kingsley che ho letto, in vista della prima lettura del suo prossimo libro, Innamorati pazzi, che di Due cuori in affitto è una sorta di prequel-sequel-durante. L'ho riletto per rinfrescarmi la memoria e ricordare più particolari possibili, e devo dire che mi è piaciuto molto più della prima volta (le stelle sono passate da 3 a 5!). Con questa lettura ho potuto apprezzare molto di più i personaggi e la loro evoluzione: la prima volta ero più concentrata sulla trama – a tratti poco realistica, certi episodi sono pura fantascienza, anche se spassosi e brillanti – e sulla storia d'amore quasi impossibile tra uno scrittore sulla cresta dell'onda e l'aspirante sceneggiatrice tanto intraprendente e determinata a affermare la propria indipendenza quanto di un'ingenuità disarmante, realizzando solo adesso che probabilmente Blake e Summer sono due dei personaggi più azzeccati e realistici della produzione targata Kinglsey. Entrambi attraversano un percorso che li porta a cambiare e maturare molto, Blake – uomo fin troppo sicuro di sè, realizzato, affermato, egosita ed egocentrico – si trova a fare i conti per la prima volta con dei sentimenti che lo spingono a porre al centro un'altra persona invece che se stesso, scoprendo – a trent'anni suonati – cosa significa e cosa comporta amare qualcuno e volerne condividere l'esistenza, invece che pensare solo a sè stesso; Summer, che ha vissuto tutta la sua esistenza all'ombra di qualcun altro (dei genitori esigenti e mai contenti, una sorella più che perfetta, un fidanzato petulante), determinata a farcela con le sue risorse e senza aiuti esterni, ma anche talmente ingenua da non rendersi conto degli atteggiamenti menefreghisti e ingrati delle persone con cui lavora, imparerà – grazie alla fiducia che comincerà a riporre in Blake – a farsi strada, a non farsi mettere i piedi in testa e troverà alla fine il suo posto nel mondo. Davvero dei bellissimi personaggi, di cui non vedo l'ora di continuare a leggere.***A re-reading of one of Kingsley's first romances I've read, in view of the first reading of her next book, “Innamorati pazzi”, which is a sort of prequel-sequel-during to “Due cuori in affitto”. I read it again to refresh my memory and remember as many details as possible, and I must say that I liked it much more than the first time (the stars have gone from 3 to 5!). With this reading, I was able to appreciate the characters and their evolution much more: the first time I was more focused on the plot – at times not very realistic, some episodes are pure science fiction, even if they are hilarious and brilliant – and on the almost impossible love story between a writer on the crest of a wave and an aspiring screenwriter as enterprising and determined to assert her independence as disarmingly naïve, realizing only now that Blake and Summer are probably two of the most apt and realistic characters in the whole Kinglsey production. Both of them go through a path that leads them to change and mature a lot. Blake - a man who is too sure of himself, accomplished, affirmed, selfish and self-centered - finds himself coming to terms, for the first time, with feelings that push him to put in evidence another person instead of himself, discovering - at the age of thirty - what it means and what it entails to really love someone and want to share their existence, instead of thinking only of himself. Summer, who has lived her entire existence in the shadow of someone else (demanding and never happy parents, a more than perfect sister, a petulant boyfriend), determined to make it on her own resources and without outside help, but also so naive not to realize the careless and ungrateful attitudes of the people he works with, she will learn - thanks to the trust she will begin to place in Blake - to make her way, not to get overwhelmed by others and will eventually find her place in the world.

Questa volta però ce l\'ho fatta.Mi è subito piaciuta la storia e l\'ambientazione. Divertente e romantica al punto giusto. In alcune scene avevo gli occhi a forma di cuoricino, ma in altre avevo i lacrimoni dal ridere. L\'ho letto in contemporanea con un altro, perchè mi sono accorta che dovevo restituirlo presto, e da ""secondo libro"" è passato immediatamente a ""primo"". Avevo continuamente in testa Blake e Summer e le loro scaramucce.Ho trovato un pò fuori luogo e inutile la quesitone del commercialista. Per il resto tutto perfetto, a parte il finale un pò frettoloso, ma romanticosoooooo.Anche qui ho scoperto che l\'autrice ha messo su Spotify la playlist delle canzoni citate nel libro.Scaricata e ascoltata subito (non mentre leggevo, perchè non ci riesco) però mi piace ascoltarla mentre sono in macchina oppure mentre cucino, e mi riporta a rivivere nella mia mente le scene del libro come se fosse un film.Secondo me è un\'idea molto bella.Ovviamente consiglio il libro alle inguaribile romaniche ^^.Adesso vedrò di recuperare gli altri suoi libri.

Cuore in affitto è la soluzione migliore».Come mi era piaciuto il precedente, ho amato molto anche questo romanzo.Avete presente una gustosa insalatona fredda, una di quelle molto colorate e appetitose che mangi quando hai voglia di tanti ingredienti ma non sai deciderti e opti per non negarti nulla?Ecco, qui vi troverete tutti gli ingredienti del romance classico (l\'immancabile storia a lieto fine, i battibecchi, le scene divertenti, le ""Scene"" con lo sguardo che si fa intenso e il brivido che scende lungo la schiena) insieme alla vivacità del romance più moderno (e quindi no al protagonista maschile perfetto che arriva cavalcando sul suo destriero, ma sì allo scrittore intellettual-chic che non disdegna i successoni commerciali, che è più materialista del negoziante all\'angolo, ma che persevera a ricoprirsi di una patina finto-stropicciata sono-un-ribelle-nell\'anima e ""me ne frego del resto del mondo perchè io sono meglio"", così come sì a una protagonista femminile che è sempre un\'eroina che arranca, ma partendo da una solida ricchezza familiare alle spalle e con la voglia di farcela nonostante tutto perché crede nel proprio talento).I due, in apparenza diversi come il giorno e la notte, ma in realtà non così tanto da non trovare un punto d\'incontro, vengono messi insieme da uno degli stratagemmi più utilizzati per costringere le personalità ad affrontarsi e a maturare velocemente: stavolta niente isola deserta dopo naufragio o appartamento di spiantati senza neppure gli occhi per piangere, bensì villone extra-lusso, spazioso e con tutti gli agi, compresa governante che provvede a pasti e pulizia.Così i nostri possono dedicarsi al puro piacere di infastidire l\'altro, farsi belli e al contempo di dare una svolta alla rispettiva carriera.Intorno a Summer e Blake un contorno effervescente di fatti e personaggi minori, tutti egualmente ben delineati, sia nel mondo dell\'editoria che della produzione di soap-opera e sceneggiati.A completare il tutto anche una seconda parte dolceamara, diciamo la nota asprigna che serve per dare rotondità al gusto della nostra insalatona.Consiglio molto anche questa lettura.E se a fine libro mi stavo dicendo che mi sarebbe piaciuta qualche scena extra, per togliermi un po\' di curiosità... subito accontentata con la NOVELLA ""Il nostro primo capitolo"" (ricordo del RARE19 di Roma) con tanti bonus da non perdere.«Dimmi qualcosa che non so».

By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend, tapping into her expertly honed people pleasing skills to embody whichever version of herself the client needs.Honestly, it’s a pretty sweet gig—until her carefully constructed Elsie-verse comes crashing down. Because Jack Smith, the annoyingly attractive and broody older brother of her favorite client, turns out to be the cold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhere. And that same Jack who now sits on the hiring committee at MIT, right between Elsie and her dream job.Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks? Not having to be anything other than her true self when she’s with him? Will falling into an experimentalist’s orbit finally tempt her to put her most guarded theories on love into practice?","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'edit:the word \'big\' in relation to jack was mentioned 12 times which is 11 times too oftenBefore I even think about starting this review I need you to know two words:lesbiansandSTEMDo I have your attention now? I should hope so because those two words are going to blow your fucking mind.i need you all to know and advocate forGeorge and Dorato get thier own romance book written by Ali herself,they are the most iconic people ever. George (Georgina) is a awesome physics women in stem and Dora makes souvolaki, people who know how to make suvolaki are next level cool. Nothing can change my mind.AND George is friends with Bee from Love on the Brain,HELLO Bee and Levi cameo.We can have a STEM Cinematic Universe where the character are all friends in some way. That would be epic. But im getting carried away.We need to advocate for a queer queens to get therelesbian women in stem romance.I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE no you dont understand its not a want, but a needSo, with that out of the way onto what you are actually here for, my thoughts on the books. And imma tell you right now that they are messy. Like toddler painting kinda messy.Sograb your popcorn, take a seat in front of the fire and let\'s get ready to RUMBLLEEEE*at this point imagine two boxers in a fighting ring, both representing my differing opinions*Okay so first lets not start with the positive because pshhh that soooo boring so lets start with what I found similar to the other two books which is an overarching theme in the Ali Hazelwood Cinematic Universe.Honestly, it\'s not as similar as i thought it would be (referancing my previous review down bellow)butwith that said there were still a heap ton of tropes and similarities to her other books.Lets have a chat about aroace chat and the spectrum hmn. I have noticed ali includes this in almost all of her novels. It was included inThe Love Hypothesisand god forbid we mention that sex scene inUnder One Roofit still remains with me no matter how much i try to purge it from my brain. And now im this book, now i am no expert when it comes to aroace rep but i feel like she always goes with the: ‘ive never wanted to have sex i dont know whats wrong with me’ line and that is so wrong.Now, there is one word that i cannot get behind and that is the use of the word “Daddy” I hate it so much. And i sould not be reading the word ‘daddy’ in a science romance book! It is simply unnacpetable and Iwill notstand for it. It was used inLove on the Brainand now this book. It will stop with this book. You hear me Ali Hazelwood?From me to you, we can both agree that miscommunication and down to earthstupidityis something we both wholeheartedly hate right? Yes well, funny you should agree because in this book and inLove on the Brainthe male love interest very patently tells them: “I DO NOT hate you I AM NOT WHO I WAS ALL THOSE YEARS AGO” somehow the amazingly smart and illtellegent women in stem still think these men hate them after literallythree whole freeking pagesof him telling her he doesnt and how he felt the entire trajectory of their relationship (from meeting to current) and i swear to you all the girls brain power must be directed towards academic because the havenone, nada, ZEROemotional intellegence EVEN AFTER BEING TOLD STRAIGHT TO THERE FACEWoah, this really rubbed me the wrong way, because it happened in TWO BOOKS and the guy is always so patient and nice. If i was in the situation god knows what I would do. Screw their heads on straight probably. They definatly need it.We all know that Ali Hazelwoodlovesto tell us every.single.page that the love interest is big and tall and ginormous and takes up all space. Granted she still did it here but toned it downa lotmy personal favourites were:“like how could i miss him when hes standing next to Adam Carlson. Theyre the Mount Rushmore of STEM academia”“He is……well, he is big. And well muscled, very well muscled”And saving the best for last:“His giant paws tightened around me”Think about that for a while won’t you?Lets talk about what I liked hmn? Why don’t you refil your popcorn and water you’ll be needing it.So, the thing I loved the most is that I had fun. I had so much fun reading the physics jokes and the story as a whole. The writing was so much better than her previous books. Praise the lord that they both had a personality and we got to know stuff about them (i didnt even know Adam was an evolutionary biologist until this book(how freaking cool is that as a job? OgkjdfjefbdhbdhjskI would kill to talk to someone with his knowlege and intelligence) like that\'s how little we got told about Adam) but in this book we got Jack\'s job upbringing and morals. It was good to have a more layered story than usual and still have fun. Usually Ali throws tropes into a mixing bowl and hopes for a delicious cake but thankfully it was a flowy story and that was not the case. InThe Love Hypothesisthere was trope after trope, as if to make readers happy and it did but gosh there was a lot jam packed in there.George was my favouite character of this entire book. She\'s my idol in life. She has many publications in physics, is super cool and has a wife that can make souvlaki. Now if you cant tell i really live Dora and George and i need their story now. I am deeply in love with both of them.I loved Elsies character development from extreme people pleaser(coming from a people pleaser) to her own person. It was so fun to see, especially with Jack helping her and calling her bullshit out.My most favourite thing of all was ofc the cameo from Adam and Olive and the friend group with all the cool science people.thatin my opinion was the best part of the bookand that\'s why we need a george and Dora book so we can have more of thatNow that all the boring stuff is out of the way let\'s get into what I didnt like because this is the real juicy stuffIhatedthe main characters actual name: Jonathan, but only because thats name of a close relative of mine and it\'s weird to read a romance with their name in itAnd that name? Jack Smith? I still stand by my clain that that sounds like the most old white man that throws money at stuff to make it go away guy. Honestly add some spice, some paprika, lemon peper, cinnamon to make it taste better on the tongue.I got the scene, that as a millennial Ali was trying to be ‘hip’ and be ‘down wid it’ as the first few chapters really showed meIn the very first chapter we got told her favourite movie was Twilight (pop culture reference is not good, we dont like that) and honestly her professor should have failed him because she liked twilight. I strongly dislike that movie and so personally i agree with the proffesor. there i said it. and yk what idc if its wrong.I think Ali is trying to live through her characters, I can see her personality come through her books and not in a good way. She includes ‘quirks’ because women in stem have to be unique and quirky. (as a woman in stem i can tell you i\'m not. I read, study, and listen to Taylor Swift. So not very quirky at all) There was a quote she put in that made me feel like Ali was justifying her opinions:”Not that there would be anything wrong: sex work is legitamite work, and people that engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters or hedge fund managers”I mean she\'s not wrong, but we didnt need to include it in a romance novel did we? So that\'s now my biggest problem, that she includes her own shit into romance novels. but i guess thats how i perceve it. Like social issues in books i dislike because i want a whole different world without all the shit that happens in this book.NB: Riddle me this: miss people pleaser can\'t tell her best friend her favourite movie was twilight but can tell her client???Okayyyy, I think I\'m done, now get up and stretch your legs, it\'s been a long read. Go to the wharepaku (toilet) and i will leave you with this:we need lesbian women in stem romance book, george and Dora are right there Ali, USE THEM.....{About this review below, yes it was insensitive for me to write a review before I read a book, but it was my opinion from reading the blurb so I am not sorry I did it}{this review is based off the synopsis i have not been given an arc}I asked and Miss Hazelwood did not deliver.This book looks like an exact carbon copy of Love on the Brain and The Love Hypothesis mashed together""Rival physicistscollide in a vortex ofacademic feuds and fake dating shenanigansin this delightfully STEMinist romcom""Sound familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam and Olive fake datedIn Love on the Brain Levi and Bee were rivals in collage""By day, she’s an adjunct professor, toiling away at grading labs and teaching thermodynamics in the hopes of landing tenure. By other day, Elsie makes up for her non-existent paycheck by offering her services as a fake girlfriend""Again InLove on the BrainBee was a scientist by day and a social media STEM infulence by night. Seems like all her characters have two \'personas\'Jack Smith,the annoyingly attractive and broodyolder brother of her favorite client, turns out to be thecold-hearted experimental physicist who ruined her mentor’s career and undermined the reputation of theorists everywhereagain, sounds familiar??In The Love Hypothesis Adam was known for turning people thesis down because \'they wernt good enough\' he was known as cold hearted and scary.In Love on the Brain, Bee thought Levi ruined her career.Also what kind of simple ass name is Jack Smith, please choose something more interesting for flavour.Elsie is prepared for an all-out war of scholarly sabotage but…those long, penetrating looks? Not having to be anything other than her true self when she’s with him? Will falling into an experimentalist’s orbit finally tempt her to put her most guarded theories on love into practice?I bet you that this book will be that the girl finds out how soft and sweet he is under that scary persona and he\'ll only be nice to herEven the covers look the sameI rest my casethank you for coming to my TED talkp.s i will still be reading this because well women in stem what am i to do? already not enough around so despite my hypothesis (get ittt) i will still be reading and lets hope that I am dead wrong.........................this looks like every other Ali Hazelwood book ESPECIALLY THE LOVE HYPOTHESIS IT LOOKS THE EXACT SAMEBut at least he doesn’t have black hair right?

She has a Ph.D. in theoretical physics. When she couldn\'t get an academic position, she resorted to fake-dating to pay off her student loans. Even though she still lives in a crappy apartment with her bestie Cece, she remains hopeful that she\'ll find a better position in the near future. She still manages to keep her head above water as an adjunct professor, teaching five different classes, grading labs, and reading her students\' very sincere emails (those emails made my week! I laughed too hard!). Meanwhile, her mother forces her to become a negotiator to solve her big brothers\' extra immature problems they\'ve gotten themselves into!Elsie\'s weakness is that she doesn\'t know the meaning of ""no""! She can never say the word! She molds herself into a different character for each person in her life, putting their needs first. That\'s why she never thinks about what she really wants from the universe!Then, her path crosses with her nemesis. She finds out that Jack Smith, the brooding but charismatic brother of her best fake-dating customer Greg, is the same person who wrote an article that ruined her mentor\'s career! Unfortunately, he\'s also the man who\'s in charge of the physics department at MIT and one of the decision-makers who will decide if she\'s the right candidate for her dream job. Jack supports another candidate for the job and is shocked to find out that Elsie is not the librarian girlfriend of her brother, as he was led to believe. As an experimental theorist, he has every intention of rejecting to work with a theorist!Elsie has no intention of giving up her dream job without a fight. She\'s determined to fight against the man who gets under her skin. Yes, she finds him very attractive. Yes, she wants to rip his clothes off and kiss him senseless, then punch him in the face. But she can restrain her feelings to be professional, right? Oh, you already know the answer!Overall, Elsie and Jack were dynamite! I loved their dialogues, hilarious banters, and blazing chemistry! This is my favorite work of the author! I wish I could give it more than five stars!Special thanks to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing for sharing this amazing digital reviewer copy with me in exchange for my honest opinions.Follow me on medium.com to read my articles about books, movies, streaming series, astrology:medium bloginstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '""You could be my entire world. If you let me.""""I think I will.""So conflicted thoughts.. It\'s not a bad rating, I did enjoy it but there were things which could have been better.✔️ Enemies to lovers✔️ STEM romance✔️ She is dating his brother (in a way)✔��� Witty banter✔️ Slow burn✔️ Twilight references (lots of them)✔️ Adam and Olive cameoFirstly, let me start by saying this one wasso much better than Love on the Brain.I hated that one so much.*sigh*Or maybe it\'s the fact that it\'s been long since I read The Love Hypothesis that this was enjoyable. Although,there are few similarities to TLH but it\'s not overbearing.Like Adam and Olive, and unlike Bee and Levi Elsie and Jack are unique and true to themselves. But if you are looking for them to recreate the same magic as in TLH, you will be disappointed. Cause the two here, are quite forgettable and bland.Elsie,is not a bad FMC, she is quite relatable in some places and such a pushover in others that it gets a bit frustrating. However she stays true to her personality- being a people pleaser. I did like how she was able to be her true self around Jack.Jackis not like Adam and that\'s simply put. Don\'t get me wrong, he is nice, kind and respectful but he is also boring. I like that he\'s paying attention to details, calling Elsie out on her bs, and always so open to her but there\'s no firepower in him. He\'s just there.""I have these elaborate daydreams that Im feeding you a five course meal I hunted, field dressed and prepare all by myself.""Coming to theromance,it was okay-ish. I enjoyed some of their moments together. I LOVED the Twilight references. I enjoyed the first half when Jack was trying to figure Elsie out, especially when she was involved with Greg. But the two had very little heat. It was not angsty.The slow burn was too slow. The spice was not spice, it was just salt and pepper.The fact that the two kept talking and talking and talking and talking and talking while trying to figure out where to put his fingers and dick in..it was too late. Look, I appreciate he wants to be sure she wants it but how many times does she have to repeat herself 😭😭 Also the fact she kept pushing him for sex after knowing how clear he made it that he wants things slow- 🚩🚩 In my opinion,I would prefer that Ali Hazelwood writes a clean romance rather than whatever tf she thinks is smut.I really loved the Adam and Olive cameo, even for a short while they radiated power, chemistry and all things good. Theendingwas okay. Doesn\'t really end big.Overall,an enjoyable read but quite forgettable.I actually forgot the FMCs name the moment I closed the book so 🤷\u200d♀️ Am just glad it was better than Love on the Brain.~•~•~Lets goooooPls don\'t disappoint~•~•~Love the cover but I swear if this is the Love Hypothesis 3.0 I\'m gonna lose it.

No one can possibly be this much of a doormat, can they?Elsie is slaving away as an adjunct professor teaching too many classes to make ends meet. She supplements her meager earnings by being a fake girlfriend, putting her people-pleasing tendencies to good use. When a chance at her dream job arises, the only thing standing in her way is Jack, the annoying older brother of someone she\'s fake-dating, who also happens to be on her interview committee. But do they really hate each other or is it more like they secretly have the hots for each other? Ha!I really enjoyed the first half of this story. It starts strong with all of the hallmarks I love from Ali Hazelwood—snark, banter, science, smart female in STEM, and puns. I was breezing through it, smiling and chuckling to myself on pretty much every sentence. No one does funny situations and dialogues quite like Hazelwood, and she had me in stitches.I\'ll grant you that the premise is a bit out there. What are the odds that the guy Elsie is hating/lusting after, is also the brother of a guy she\'s fake-dating, while also being the only person who almost beat her at Go, while also being the guy who irreparably damaged her field of study back in the day, while also being the head of the physics department at MIT where she is interviewing? I\'ll tell you what, it\'s 100% according to this book.But as the story went on, Elsie started to annoy me. First, she refuses to believe that Jack is attracted to her even though he tells her so on multiple occasions. At one point, she even interprets him saying ""Can I take you out?"" as he wants to murder her mob-style. Like what?Elsie also takes people-pleasing to heretofore-unseen heights. She lies to her roommate about pretty much every preference she has. She runs interference for her brothers at her mom\'s behest even though she doesn\'t want to. And she must get her mentor\'s approval before accepting a job offer that would give her several times her current salary and health insurance. Have mercy! My eyeballs were bruised from all the rolling.It\'s no secret that I prefer my female characters to be strong and smart, ready to kick ass and save the world. Elsie is strong in her work, but the opposite in every other way. And slowly, over many demure ""You can\'t possibly like me,"" it started to grate on my nerves. Not even Hazelwood\'s many comedic reliefs can save it from such never-ending waffling and meekness.This may just have been a case where I wasn\'t a good fit for the book. Without being able to connect with Elsie, I never really invested in the story. Not to mention I couldn\'t feel any chemistry between Jack and Elsie, and it all made for a rather lackluster read by the end.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:The Love HypothesisLove on the BrainThe STEMinist NovellasUnder One RoofStuck with You~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

Better than theLove Hypothesis(4-stars) andLove on the Brain(3-stars)! Honestly, my favorite contemporary romance of the year! 🤩Ali Hazelwood is the QUEEN OF STEM ROMANCE!Seriously, I could give two flying f*cks about STEM, yet somehow Ali is able to center an entire story around it while making it interesting and explaining it in a way that allows me to understand. But what always stands out is the way Ali portrays the struggles women in STEM have to go through. From blatant sexism to sexual harassment to manipulation, the challenges are appalling and endless. I specifically liked how she dives into the \'type\' of acceptable women in STEM:""The you people want is sharp, impeccable, perfect enough to justify your intrusion in a field that for centuries has been \'rightfully\' male. But not too perfect, because apparently only \'stone-cold bitches\' are like that, and they do not make for congenial, affable colleagues.""For fuck\'s sake, that\'s insane, but the absolute truth. It\'s infuriating to see the amount of pandering women in STEM have to do to the men in their field so that they are accepted. Once again, thank you, Ali Hazelwood, for bringing awareness to such an important topic.I really connected to Elsie on a personal level.Elsie has been a people pleaser her entire life, to the point that she masquerades many different faces around different people in order to fit their expectations or make them love and accept her. This begs the question of who is the real Elsie Hannaway? Unfortunately, Elsie doesn\'t really know since she\'s been living her life for others and ignores what she truly wants and needs. I know some people might think that the extent to which she people pleases is dramatic, but I can with 100% certainty say, I\'ve been her. Yes, I\'ve put on facades to make people feel more at ease. I\'ve lied about my likes and interests to fit in with people. I\'ve tampered down my own personality so people will find me more acceptable. I\'ve done things I didn\'t want to do because it\'s what was expected of me. And this didn\'t just happen with strangers. It also happened around friends and family. And let me tell you, it was exhausting and terrifying not being able to just be who you are - living in constant fear that someone will dislike you or find you weird or think you\'re beneath them. Luckily, I went to therapy and have worked on breaking out of the people-pleasing cycle. And I\'m so glad Elsie also starts therapy at the end. I really think Ali Hazelwood did a fantastic job portraying what it\'s like being a people-pleaser and how much it can emotionally and psychologically impact you.The friendship between Cece and Elsie was everything.I really adore Cece\'s humor and how incredibly loyal, supportive, and loving she is to Elise. And even after finding out Elsie hasn\'t been completely open and honest with her, Cece\'s first instinct is to say,""I will love you forever.""My heart nearly burst wide open because that is true love.Jack. The love of my life. One of my favorite MMC of all time!Where do I even begin with this man? He\'s perceptive, confident, honest, charming, thoughtful, intelligent, kind, handsome, sexy, and pretty much the most perfect man to ever be written! I love him (in case you can\'t tell lol). Not only does he fall first, but he is a huge freaking simp for Elsie and just wants to take care of her. Seriously, this guy is a dream. 😍 But what I love even more is that Jack is a supportive KING! Jack encourages Elsie to just be herself, and while she struggles to learn exactly whose that is, he is there with constant love and support, and lets her discover these things in her own time.The romance is perfection!We start with so much tension, misconceptions, and hate (on Elsie\'s side), and then it explodes into this profoundly wonderful and deeply emotional love. There\'s so much chemistry, respect, love, and care between these two that it makes my heart soar.The spice was a RIDE!Our girl Elsie has never really enjoyed sex or felt much sexual attraction towards anyone . . . before Jack. And while Elsie wants to just jump his bones, Jack takes his time and focuses first and foremost on her pleasure and her pleasure alone, all so she can discover what she likes. And DAMN it is HOT. 🥵 This is the spiciest Ali Hazelwood book yet, and I ATE THAT SHIT UP!""I think I want to do this every day,"" he responds, kissing my pussy like he would my mouth. ""Every day for the rest of my life.""I also love that Jack sets some boundaries sexually because he wants to make sure this is truly something Elsie wants, and not just something she thinks she has to do for him to like her (which we learn is something she did with a previous partner).Overall, Love, Theoretically is a witty, charming, and sexy story with lots of depth that will make you laugh and tug at your heart.Ali Hazelwood\'s writing is a dream, the pacing is fantastic, and the characters are so amazing that you can\'t help but fall in love with them. I could go on and on about all the things I love about this book, but this would turn into a full-blown essay, so I\'ll stop here. But the bottom line is this is one of the best contemporary romance books I\'ve ever read. I 100% recommend reading it and hope you love it as much as I do!Thank you to NetGalley and Berkley Publishing Group for providing an eARC in exchange for an honest review!

If you let me""Yep, that\'s right. AND, I am just going to say it..... this book is BETTER than The Love Hypothesis, I said what I said.Elsie is an adjunct professor struggling to make ends meet financially while also not doing the work that she really feels passionate about when the opportunity of a lifetime, to teach/research at MIT, presents itself. She just has to nail her interview and all her dreams will come true. But there is just one problem. Jack Smith. Her professional nemesis, a man that she hates like it\'s her religion, and is also one of the deciding votes on whether or not she gets the job. Oh, and he also is the brother of the man she is fake dating. Whoops.Aahh! I LOVED this book so much. I am as shocked as anyone, bc its easily my favorite contemporary romance of the year so far. I was really weary going in bc of so many mixed reviews, but honestly this book just resonated with me. The romance is fantastic, I am a sucker for academic rivals and this one is done PERFECTLY! The tension is soooo good! It was objectively hilarious, the banter was top tier, the cast of supporting characters were absolutely delightful from her quirky best friend Cece to the puny professor Volkov and Jacks sweet brother and taciturn grandmother, they all served to move the story in someway and were fun and interesting. AND CAN WE TALK ABOUT THE ADAM AND OLIVE CAMEO?!!!! 😍😍 SO CUTE!!!!! Also, this is her best writing by far, the pacing is perfect, the story flows, it was funny and smart and well developed from start to finish.Elsie-I really, really love Elsie and I know that at times she isn\'t exactly easy to love bc she masks so much but I really appreciated her struggles with her identity. She has formed this survival instinct born from childhood emotional neglect and then later just being a woman trying to get by in a field that is largely a boys club and she loses herself and ultimately this pseudo persona overwhelms her whole life . I really liked seeing a woman become self aware and take steps to change that and that it was hard and not immediate. So often I see people say, well she should know better or she is too smart to be so oblivious, and sometimes that\'s true. But sometimes it\'s not, and there is a process of change that has to happen and those paths are never neat or pretty and I really appreciated that progression in her character arc. And also, a high IQ doesn\'t always equal a high EQ, being smart doesn\'t exempt you from having deep emotional issues and doesn\'t make you any less smart, it just makes you human.Jack-Ahh this man is so whipped for Elsie and I LOVED it! And can we just talk about how good dirty he is?! I already have a thing for the surly Professor type and this is another one that goes on the roster of top hot teachers bc damn! The fireworks and the chemistry between Jack and Elsie were AMAZING! I ate it up and also I thought the sex scenes were super hot and I also appreciated that they were realistic. I kind of liked that they were trial and error bc not everyone is some sexpert like you read in so many novels. But besides that, I love how he respects Elsie and her talent. He is attentive to everything about her and sees the real her and forces her to be herself and drop the pretense but he does it in a way that is so non judgmental and supportive of what Elsie wants for herself and not everyone else including him. I love that he isn\'t perfect either and also struggling with his own issues.Random things I loved-CeCe, Elsie\'s best friend is so funny and weird and she made me laugh the entire book.-George was so sweet!-The grandmother, you gotta love an old lady that gives zero fucks and tells it like it is.-The Twilight references 🤌-The Hoth reference!!-Olive and Adam 😭😭'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Oh, wow.

I\'ve only read The Love Hypothesis by this author before and it was highly enjoyable (I rated it 4 stars). BUT THIS ONE WAS AMAZING. To be honest, this is not my original opinion, but I\'ve seen people say this is Hazelwood\'s best work so far. I\'m not exactly qualified to speak on this, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT I LOVED THIS BOOK. Yes the romance was very typically Ali Hazelwood, highly unrealistic and bubbly, but you simply cannot hate it. However, there were certain parts of this story that really sticked out to me and for that reason I\'ll list them here:1. THE PLOT - I would suggest going into this book without reading the blurb. I haven\'t read it before reading the actual book and that\'s why this was like an Easter egg to me. Important plot points were revealed early in the book, BUT THOSE REVELATION SCENES were so good, my Kindle flew across the room. This is another Ali Hazelwood ""Women in STEM find unrealistically good gigantic men"" novel and that\'s all you need to know. And yeah, they\'re physicists in this one!2. THEORISTS VS EXPERIMENTALISTS - Listen, I don\'t care for physics, I had an A back in high school but I always hated the subject (sorry not sorry). Which means, theories and experiments on crystals, research papers on quantum mechanics and what not don\'t mean much to me, but in this little novel (not really little, this was THICK) YOU CAN\'T POSSIBLY IMAGINE HOW MUCH BANTER WE GOT from their scientific disagreements. Sign me up, nerds are hot! But also like, we didn\'t get TMI on those topics, so I didn\'t feel suffocated.3. THE JOKES - This book had me LAUGHING on so many occasions. And I\'m not big on laughing while reading, especially LAUGHING OUT LOUD! But hey, I was gasping at some of these. And unfortunately, most of those dad jokes that one professor (can\'t be bothered to check his name again) threw around had me hollering. ALSO, student mail that Elsie received was peak humour.4. POP CULTURE REFERENCES - As much as I can remember, Ali Hazelwood is big on these. Here, it was like every other sentence. But my silly little gemini brain feeds off of them! Barbie was mentioned, Chris Nolan (TWICE), A PERFECT CURE FOR MY POST-BARBENHEIMER DEPRESSION (I don\'t know if that\'s a thing, pls tell me is anyone has it). Like I said, I got this book WHEN I needed it and it was WHAT I needed.5. ACADEMIA REALNESS - this aspect is something I admire Ali Hazelwood for. And said aspect was more prominent in this book than in The Love Hypothesis. Even though these books are unrealistic (I\'m tired of myself saying that), they still deliver some very real situations that happen in STEM surroundings almost every day. I\'m a med student myself and I\'ve spent 4 years already in this atmosphere, so certain struggles (money, women in science, stealing work, struggling to achieve your goals, abandoning your interests for your scientific dream) Elsie has (had) I really can identify with. Hazelwood gives you this very cruel manly toxic world and offers you a perfect fairytale escape, MOTHER ENERGY!🧎🏼\u200d♀️6. MEDICAL CONDITION REP - Our female protagonist in this novel has diabetes type 1, while she doesn\'t have health insurance and has to finance each and every insulin bolus herself. I\'m not making it to be this big Nobel-prize-for-peace thing, but it was nice to see this very common but life-threatening condition represented in popular fiction!CHARACTERS I usually describe main characters separately but I won\'t be doing that here. I loved Elsie and Jack equally. Their chemistry was really well-written. Many aspects of their personalities are sort of spoilers so I also won\'t be sharing those. Other aspects were written above. One thing tho, Jack\'s physical description reminds me of Dominic Sherwood (used to act in the terrible Shadowhunters show). Did anyone else get that reference (was he by any chance based on Dom or am I making that up)? Pls tell me in the comments. 🧐NOTE: This book was much spicier that The Love Hypothesis so do with that info what you want! 🤭I CAN\'T WAIT TO READ MORE ALI HAZELWOOD!💕💕'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Oh my GOD this book. Where do I even start? First of all, 5 stars. Easy. EASY 5 stars. There’s just something about the stories Ali Hazelwood crafts and the personalities she writes that hit with me. I loved The Love Hypothesis beyond words and was a bit iffy on Love on the Brain, so I wasn’t quite sure how this one was going to go, but oh my god she delivered again.@baskinsuns on tiktok has a really great video on this topic, but the way that Ali Hazelwood writes these male love interests who have such a deep and gentlelikeof the heroine is so…ooh she’s ruining my life. Yes it’s a romance novel so obviously they fall in love, but Jack Smith genuinely likes and enjoys Elsie as a person outside of his romantic love for her. He respects her, he admires her, he wants to hear her talk about the things she enjoys and he wants to experience them with her simply because it makes her happy. There’s a softness to the way Ali Hazelwood’s men care for their partners that just hits different.And the academic rivals in this book? Top fucking tier. From the very get go. It’s delicious. Delectable. I’m eating it up on every goddamn page. The dynamic it engenders between Elsie - the consummate People Pleaser - and the love interest being the one person she doesn’t care about pleasing is amazing.The story is beyond engaging, it went in some directions I didn’t expect it to go, it had me rooting for physics debates, and I could have read another hundred pages of these two.And you know what really REALLY shows how much I love this book? If you’ve been here for a little while you probably know I hate pop culture references in books. Viscerally. This book is at minimum 8% TWILIGHT references, and it was still an easy 5 stars. No question about it.I loved our main couple, I loved the side characters (I would read an entire novella about visits with Millicent), I was super invested in the plot, and the third act and finale is just…everything is so good.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I think that ending the acknowledgements section of this book with the sentence ""Time is a finite and precious resource, and I\'m constantly overcome with emotion that people choose to spend it on my words"" was not particularly nice of the author to do. But the time isn\'t coming back, and if there\'s one thing I intend to do tonight, it\'s succumb to the sunk cost fallacy. On with the review.I tend to leave Ali Hazelwood alone because I\'m not in her intended demographic (read: person who can see one character responding to another character\'s ignorance about clothes with ""Wow. Men."" without wanting to die), but I picked this up because I saw that the protagonist works as a hired girlfriend, and I wanted to know whether it was going to be offensive or not. It is, which is sad, because the author has clearly worked very hard to make it less so; there\'s a point early when she specifies that the work she doescertainlydoesn\'t include sex, and then reassures us that she does believe sex work is real work, ""and people who engage in it are just as deserving of respect as ballerinas, or firefighters, or hedge fund managers."" Sure! Great! Hedge fund managing is not real work, but I get where you\'re coming from!It\'s just that this comes in the same book as the character referring to cracking a bad pun in order to increase her chances of getting a job as ""this prostitution of my sense of humor"", and the whole premise is that the love interest is the person she can ""be her real self around"", unlike her clients, even though he is 1) on her hiring committee and 2) immediately after he leaves her hiring committee, offers her a job. Also, the heroine\'s roommate, who also works as a hired girlfriend, is ""way too beautiful"" to be good at it without problems. I mean, okay.Honestly, the author just doesn\'t seem particularly interested in the whole premise, except as a way to emphasize that the heroine\'s people-pleasing problems arereallybad—I mean, they\'re so bad that she even... lets herself be PAID to pretend to DATE. The whole line between ""faking being a girlfriend"" and ""working as a girlfriend"" seems pretty unclear to Hazelwood—some of the work entails making up stories to her clients\' family and friends about how the two of them met and whether she\'s being paid, which is obviously faking something, but she also specifies that other gigs just entail ""going places as arm candy"" without talking. I bring this up because I do kind of feel that the author believes (or is working on believing) that sex-adjacent work isn\'t inherently shameful, but she does think on some level itisinherently dishonest. Which: mm.Mainly the reason I feel this way is because the whole arc of the novel is our heroine getting over her people-pleasing tendencies. At this point I need to be clear that this is just not a very well-written character trait. She refers, constantly, to having a different version of herself for every social situation, but what we actually see her do is ""say something nice to a girl who\'s about to cry"", ""crack jokes to someone who enjoys jokes"", ""pretend to like movies she doesn\'t like"", and ""help sort out family problems when her mom asks her to."" At one point she says she\'s about to tell us her tried-and-true procedure for Becoming A Different Person, and it is, in full: 1) Figure out what the other person needs. 2) Plan to do it. 3) Do it. Like—can we get something about, I don\'t know, observing body language? Altering tone? The protagonist references ""code-switching"" by name, but she never seems to use different registers for different situations? Plato identified four types of flattery off the top of his head and he didn\'t even have Google, man, is this really the best we can do? Anyway. You can see how this person would get pushed around a lot, sure (a female romance protagonist? with no backbone? Groundbreaking.), but the shapeshifting social chameleon that we\'re told about just never really appears.What does appear is someone who\'s considerate of others, but absolutely miserable about that, and only feels like her ""real self"" when she\'s yelling at the love interest. From the bottom of my heart: \'kay. How Ithinkthe author intended these scenes to come across, though, is less that the heroine is constantly shapeshifting into new people and more that she is someone constantly in what we might call ""customer service mode"".I feel, generally, weird about the idea that someone who can\'t switch out of customer service mode makes a particularly good escort, and it would remain a kind of weird itch in the back of my brain, but that line about ""prostitution of my sense of humor"" pushes it over the line for me a little. It\'s hard to shake the feeling that Hazelwood has articulated to herself that Elsie is ""prostituting her personality out to everyone she meets"", or something of that nature. (Not sexually, of course! She\'ll describe the sex with her ex that she didn\'t enjoy at all and only had to please him, but she wasn\'t beingpaidfor it!) I feel weird when the heroine reassures the hero that her last client (his brother) is so nice that she ""would have [worked as his girlfriend] for free"". And I feel weirder when the heroine and the hero\'s whole relationship seems to consist of him going ""What do you wanna do?"", her saying, ""What doyouwanna do?"", and him going sternly, ""No... what doyouwanna do?"" until she gets wildly turned on.Like—again, this man is on her hiring committee. I don\'t really buy that she simply can\'t turn on customer-service mode with him just because she can\'t read his face. (In a book where the heroine\'s number one thing is Loving The Twilight Saga, I will admit that ""he\'s the only person whose mind she can\'t read!!!"" as a plot point is absolutely hilarious.) When inauthenticity is so explicitly tied to her escort work, and she falls for him because he aggressively refuses to let her be ""inauthentic"", it feels... kind of like she\'s a ~fallen woman who he\'s saving~, if you see what I mean.Anyway, I should note that she has Type 1 diabetes and, due to sudden and plot-convenient miscalculations of her blood sugar, twice faints dramatically in his arms. It\'s so hard to get a proper case of consumption these days.There are at least three plot-relevant issues of miscommunication that happen because, just as someone is about to say something important, something loud or disgusting happens in the background. Also, the protagonist once describes ""fantasies of filling [the hero] with candy and taking a bat to him"". Time is a finite and precious resource, and it becomes increasingly evident that the Fates have not marked me to spend it on shit that is good. At this point I will accept ""wild"", I guess.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""You need a life-saving advice?

Follia
",Patrick McGrath,3.96,35082,3183,"Fiction, Horror, Thriller, Gothic, Mystery, Psychology, Historical Fiction",294,29-08-1996,"«Le storie d’amore contraddistinte da ossessione sessuale sono un mio interesse professionale ormai da molti anni». Inghilterra, 1959. Dall’interno di un tetro manicomio criminale vittoriano uno psichiatra comincia a esporre, con apparente distacco, il caso clinico più perturbante che abbia incontrato nella sua carriera – la passione letale fra Stella Raphael, moglie di un altro psichiatra dell’ospedale, e Edgar Stark, un artista detenuto per un uxoricidio particolarmente efferato. È una vicenda cupa e tormentosa, che fin dalle prime righe esercita su di noi una malìa talmente forte da risultare quasi incomprensibile – finché lentamente non ne emergono le ragioni nascoste. Il fatto è che in questo straordinario romanzo neogotico McGrath ci scalza dalla posizione abituale, e confortevole, di lettori, chiedendoci di adottare il punto di vista molto più scabroso di chi conduce una forma singolarmente perversa di indagine: il lavoro analitico. Eppure qualcosa, forse una tensione che a poco a poco diventa insopportabile, ci avverte che i conti non tornano, e che l’inevitabile, scandalosa e beffarda verità sarà molto diversa da quella che eravamo stati costretti a immaginare.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': 'It says on the back this book is a meditation on the nature of love. So, what is love? Love is when someone gently tugs this book out of your hands and says ""you don\'t need to read this one, dear. All the quotes on the back were paid for. It\'s high class tripe.""'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Quando l’ho afferrato dallo scaffale della biblioteca non mi sono accorta che era fra le proposte di lettura del mese, e un piccolo foglietto sbucava dalla prima pagina, con l’indicazione “Piccola farmacia letteraria”:""Smettere di fumare""Si consiglia “Follia” di Patrick McGrath: ""Follia"" vi farà trattenere il respiro, schiacciandovi i polmoni. E chiudendovi la gola in un momento di terrore insopportabile. Se non siete ancora riusciti a smettere, questo vi convincerà che è proprio necessario.Insomma, un modo simpatico per associare, ad ogni malanno, un libro da leggere. Con l’indicazione di “Piccola farmacia letteraria” di libri ce n’erano diversi, ma io volevo “Follia” e non certo perché fumo, ma perché il titolo girava nella mia mente da un bel pezzo.Tuttavia, devo ammettere che il consiglio della biblioteca si è rivelato valido: “Follia” mi ha mozzato il respiro, mi ha chiusa in una morsa di terrore puro dall\'inizio alla fine, e dall\'inizio alla fine ho sentito i battiti del cuore mentre le pagine scorrevano via, una dopo l’altra.La storia, quella di un rapporto extraconiugale fra la moglie di uno psichiatra e un paziente dello stesso, sullo sfondo della Londra degli anni ’60, non è nulla di straordinario, ma è il modo in cui è narrata a fare la differenza. Stella, la protagonista, folle e affascinante, racconta la sua storia ad uno psichiatra collega del marito, il Dottor Cleave, che poi è la voce narrante del romanzo: costui entra nella sua psiche, turbata e complessa, e la osserva, la studia, con un occhio clinico ma anche con tanta curiosità, con tanto interesse e con un pizzico di soggezione, quasi ammirasse una rosa rara, profumata ma piena di spine. Il ritratto psicologico dei personaggi, compresi il Dottor Cleave e Max, marito tradito di Stella, rappresentano il pregio maggiore di questo thriller elegante e di classe, nel quale eros, sentimento e malattia sembrano fondersi in un connubio raffinato e delicato.E, al di là di tutto, se i consigli della “Piccola farmacia letteraria” sono tutti così validi, mi viene voglia di tornare presto in quella biblioteca e di scegliere questa volta un titolo in base al mio malanno del momento:i libri sono una vera medicina, più di molto altro!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Un libro apparentemente semplice, ma che credo nasconda molto più di quanto sembri. Basta classificarlo come una semplice storia d'amore maledetta o come l'inabissarsi della protagonista Stella nei meandri della follia? Forse è così. Forse, in realtà, tra le righe del romanzo, si cela la denuncia di una società che oggettivizza l'essere umano, che lo categorizza sino a disumanizzarlo e a farne un numero tra tanti, che ne abusa a piacimento e se ne libera altrettanto a piacimento, che contribuisce alla sua solitudine e al senso di vuoto e, in ultima analisi, forse gli rende più gradito rifugiarsi nella follia che seguitare a recitare in una grottesca farsa.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Stella mi disse di aver capito in quel momento che in ciascuno di noi c’è come l’anelito a gridare al mondo la verità, a qualsiasi costo. O a distruggersi.La prima cosa che ho pensato terminata la lettura di questo romanzo è stata: Patrick McGrath mi ha presa per i fondelli per tutta la lettura. Insomma, o mi ha presa per i fondelli, o davvero questo romanzo ha venduto migliaia di copie imbastito con i migliori tessuti della fiera delle banalità. So che solitamente si inizia a parlare dall’inizio, e non dalla fine, ma è quest’ultima parte del libro che ha reso la mia lettura così offuscata e indefinita quale è e se davvero voglio parlarvi di questo libro in un modo che sia quantomeno razionale devo iniziare da lì, sbrogliando la matassa di un finale che mi ha lasciata con tante domande, la principale delle quali èquesto libro mi è piaciuto?Se McGrath non fosse quell’astuto conoscitore di psicologia umana che è, archivierei il caso, e lascerei perdere sentendo di aver fatto una lettura piacevole, ma non particolarmente toccante. Invece, so che l’autore mi ha psicoanalizzata, mi ha fatta stendere sul suo lettino e con una serie di passaggi mi ha portata per mano sino a farmi credere ciò che voleva credere, ed è per me fondamentale svegliarmi da questo stato di incoscienza per capire davvero cosa io devo pensare, non cosa l’autore vuole farmi pensare.Insomma, visualizzate un triangolo, e ai tre vertici posizionate Stella Raphael, moglie del vicedirettore di un ospedale psichiatrico, Edgar Stark, paziente detenuto per uxoricidio, Peter Cleave, brillante medico dello stesso istituto. Se per 295 pagine è facile credere che Edgar sia il pazzo, Stella la sua vittima che giunge alla depressione e Peter il medico affabile in grado di seguire questo caso con grande occhio clinico e capacità, sul finale i vertici di questo triangolo si destabilizzano e quello che era un chiaro, geometrico e definito triangolo diventa un amalgama di fatti ed eventi che stravolgono tutta la lettura e ti lasciano a bocca aperta.Ma sono sicura di aver letto la versione veritiera? Chi mi assicura che pazzo non sia anche chi cerca di rendermi questa vicenda nel modo più razionale e analitico possibile?Insomma, sì. Per dare un contengo a questa lettura io voglio credere che l’autore mi abbia tenuta in ballo incollata alle pagine truffandomi ed esponendomi un punto di vistaconvincendomiche fosse quello giusto, l’unico giusto, per darmi la batosta finale nella quale, scossa, mi risveglio e mi interrogo spiegandomi che un interesse così morboso verso un caso clinico non può che essere l’elemento foriero di una ben più grande patologia. Non potevo accorgermi prima che il fatto che un medico prenda così a cuore un caso? Non potevo accorgermi prima che Follia non è solo l’amore di Stella per un pazzo omicida, ma anche il bisogno quasi vitale di un medico di avere un pugno i suoi due pazienti quasi fossero due topi ai quali vuole somministrare sostanze per studiarne poi la reazione alle stesse? Ecco, preferisco essere stata io la stupida, che McGrath il banale, preferisco sentenziare a favore della sua genialità, piuttosto che giustificare la mia ingenuità, per arrivare così a dire che Follia è un bel libro, non irrinunciabile, certo, ma comunque bello. Sembra quasi un viaggio dantesco, una discesa infernale verso le asperità della vita, verso il culmine dell’irrazionalità; sono rimasta lì, incollata e perseguitata senza tregua da queste pagine, a vedere come la psiche turbata di Stella degenerasse in preda di un amore che la stava divorando, di una passione sessuale così forte da renderla prima incauta, poi depressa, poi completamente vuota. McGrath ha svuotato questo suo personaggio femminile così come con un cucchiaio si potrebbe mangiare il ripieno di un frutto, sino a lasciarne la buccia floscia, insaporita, ormai inutile.Non nascondo l’inquietudine provata, la forte perturbazione che questa lettura mi ha prodotto; chissà quali smorfie ho fatto sull’aereo mentre mi deformavo al deformarsi degli eventi, alla vista di una persona sana che perde di vista la lucidità. McGrath è stato particolarmente bravo ad inchiodarmi con le sue grinfie, nella morsa schiacciante dell’evoluzione di una mente umana di fronte alla passione, alla rottura degli equilibri. Tuttavia non nascondo neanche che mi sarei aspettata molto di più da questo libro, un maggiore approfondimento del perché di alcuni fatti forse accantonato a favore di uno stile essenziale e strettamente clinico che l’autore consegna alla prima persona di questo romanzo.Una lettura tutto sommato consigliata, anche se, come dire, non mi ha fatto strappare via i capelli per l’emozione!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Alla fine il folle è Edgar, Stella, o Peter? Fin dall\'inizio della lettura sembra palese che il malato psichiatrico sia Edgar Stark, uomo che ha ucciso anni prima sua moglie dopo aver creato nella sua mente una ""realtà fittizia"": era convinto che Ruth lo stesse tradendo con molti uomini dall\'inizio del loro matrimonio, che sostanzialmente fosse una puttana. Con il susseguirsi della lettura si fa sempre più chiaro un problema: l\'ossessione sessuale di Stella per quest\'uomo, che la porta a nascondere dei segreti, iniziare una seconda vita, partire, allontanarsi dai suoi affetti stabili. Proprio lei, moglie di uno dei medici del manicomio, si innamora di uno dei pazienti più problematici, che è apparentemente innocuo, gentile, affabile, sicuro di sé, ma che in realtà manifesta episodi di pazzia, rabbia improvvisa, paranoie. Peter, uno dei medici del manicomio, che poi diventerà il direttore, sembra essere l\'unica persona mentalmente stabile, un punto di riferimento. Tuttavia, col susseguirsi degli eventi, si inizia a percepire che qualcosa non va: come può un semplice medico occuparsi di un tale caso clinico, ricercando ossessivamente tutti i dettagli, arrivando persino a chiedere di sposare Stella, nonostante fosse una delle sue pazienti? Ebbene, credo che in realtà, alla fine, il vero ""folle"" di questa storia sia proprio Peter, poiché ossessionato dalla tragica storia di Stella e del suo amante, Edgar.

I'm getting sick of picking them up and will read them from the bottom up. It's like a Survivor Challenge as I wiggle out the bottom book without causing the whole lot to topple upon my head. I bought it five years ago at a library sale according to the withdrawn library stamp. Shameful.Psychiatrist Peter Cleave tells a supposedly sordid tale of a former patient, love affairs gone terribly wrong, sexual obsession and madness but alas he’s such a boring fellow the story has no emotional appeal, no sense of drama, and no interesting tidbits to savor and drool over. He skims over the good stuff and me, being the fool I am, continued to read waiting for my interest to become engaged and hoping to feel something for these screwed up people. Alas, I remain a fool.Doc Peter works in an asylum for the criminally insane which happens to be within walking distance of the home of their newly hired superintendent, his beautiful but bored housewife Stella and their young son Charlie. When an inmate named Edgar is hired on to do some work on their grounds Stella gets all hot and bothered by his sweltering looks and big brawny chest and begins to romanticize his criminal history. She starts to believe he only murdered his ex love because he loved her so very deeply. Awwww, isn't that the sweetest? So I assumed bad things were going to happen and was looking forward to an emotionally disturbing read about a dumb housewife and a hunky headcase but I was so bored I could barely get through it.This could have been an interesting gothic-y tale but the problem for me was Peter’s first person narration. It makes the book feel a bit stuffy and distances me from the people he’s prattling on and on about. Because the book is told entirely from Peter’s point of view or from snippets he gleaned from interviews with Edgar and Stella, who withheld all interesting tidbits it seems, we are only told the unexciting parts of the story. Peter has no imagination and doesn’t fill in the blanks very well either. Damn it all. I’m not a perv, really I’m not, but when a book jacket touts “passion” and “strange love” I expect something slightly exciting and not a whole bunch of boring accounts of day to day strolls through the garden, tedious conversations and a painfully slow and uninteresting descent into madness.I waded through countless pages waiting for something interesting to happen and honestly, for me, it never freaking did. Even when tragedy occurs I felt so distanced from the characters that there was no emotional reaction from me as a reader. And when the last revelation made by Peter is revealed I found it so ridiculously unbelievable that I wanted to scream. Finally, an emotional reaction but for all of the wrong reasons! I regret wasting several hours struggling through this book and can’t recommend it unless you’re into really boring melodramas.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Questo romanzo è folle.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75 non un 4 pienoOssessione, isteria, depressioneCos\'è un\' ossessione?Essere ossessionati da qualcuno o qualcosa beh, non è così impossibile.

James,Henry James,Sheridan Le Fanu,Ambrose Bierce,Bram Stoker,Algernon Blackwood, and many others when, I got a strong urge to search out modern writers who might be doing some of the same things with their storytelling.And that\'s how I stumbled across two writers that stood out from the rest of the pack:Thomas LigottiandPatrick McGrath.Ligottiis known more for tellingLovecraftiantales that are connected as much to dreams as they are to curious realities.McGrathis doing something altogether different.Patrick McGrathis a writer of immense literary powers. Every sentence feels right and natural in its conception. This in itself can be good or bad. Bad you say? Yes. It can be bad and a bit offputtiing when the power of the word is more impactful than the story itself. Even more common today is the power of strong likeable charactersoverthe storyoverthe writers gift with a pen. Because I like many different voices, I feel that nearly all published writers I\'m interested in have different gifts, and mattering on my mood, can fall under the spell of any one of them.However, so it\'s clear,Patrick McGrathis a writer\'s writer. And certainly not for all tastes. Further, he\'s not going to be selling out and writing the next book to be developed into a blockbuster Hollywood scare and share movie. True, a couple of his books have been developed into moderately successful movies, but, most likely, they\'re none you\'ve probably heard of.I think it\'s writers likeMcGraththat can more commonly write books that are either a huge hit or miss. A contrast to author\'s who\'s expectant style is always comfortably familiar, full of characters and a world that are always there for you to sit down with, just like old familiar friends sitting in your living room watching TV with you...and so it\'s a no-brainer you can rest easy and enjoy.McGrathmay even be an acquired taste, though not for me.I liked him immediately. That may be because I started off with the right book.But, on to this one.Asylumstarts off rekindling the fires of a prose I\'m immediately drawn to, even though its conclusion was more like a slowgoing moth to a flame.:)The brilliant interplay of the dialogue, and cast of characters, pulled me in, as well as the intricacies of the plot set up.I think the story synopsis details it very accurately:In the summer of 1959 Stella Raphael joins her psychiatrist husband, Max, at his new posting--a maximum-security hospital for the criminally insane. Beautiful and headstrong, Stella soon falls under the spell of Edgar Stark, a brilliant and magnetic sculptor who has been confined to the hospital for murdering his wife in a psychotic rage.But Stella\'s knowledge of Edgar\'s crime is no hindrance to the volcanic attraction that ensues--a passion that will consume Stella\'s sanity and destroy her and the lives of those around her.Back then, I never read all the way through the details on the back cover or any book description too deeply because mySherlockBananabrain was always rushing to story possibilities and conclusions before I even read the dang thing! I purchasedAsylumat my favorite bookstore in the entire galaxy,The Dark Carnivalin Berkeley, CA, and a store employee (definitelynotJack, the quiet, brilliant clerk/owner), who, misinformed me thatAsylumwas""..like a Dr. Lecter love story set in a mental institution.""Well. It\'s not. And, he wasn\'t even close! It\'s nothing like that. Not even remotely. Thatwouldmake for a cool book though!I thought it started off amazingly and there was no doubt it was anything but a 5 star level book. Until about halfway through, that is. After that, it wore out a lot of it\'s welcome and its warm fire started petering out, but, luckily, there was just enough warmth left for me to stay with it. It originally had a lot going for it, including plot sequences that were perfectly realized but, just none of them ended up going where I wanted them to go. Nor was the story nearly as captivating once the characters started meandering into madness.Funny enough, every line in the book was masterful. I just thought it lost it\'s power in the second half, leading to a mostly predictable conclusion, which can only be expected if you\'ve read the back cover description.Predictability doesn\'t necessarily mean I\'m not going to like it as a whole. I mean, I knew whereStar Warswas headed and loved every second of it, all the way up to everybody clapping hands as our heroes got awarded -- *note: except for Chewie :(-- Doesn\'t bother me to know where a book\'s going. This one just didn\'t go to a place I was interested in. It all wraps up in perfect late1940\'s film style(though it\'s set in 1959) and is a good book. It\'s just not a great book.In 2005,Asylum, was made into a movie. I think it might be better that way because you\'d be able to see and feel the passion coming through living, breathing, characters.I haven\'t seen it.I suggest readingThe Grotesqueif you want to get your feet wet inPatrick McGrath\'spool. If you\'re more a fan of supernatural fiction, ranging from fantasy, to sci-fi, to horror, or a fan of short stories, go getBlood and Water and Other Tales. ReadAsylumonly after you\'ve read his better books.*If you do purchase this book, there are many printed versions. I suggest the one I bought. It has a black cover with a gold gate - like a golden gate that opens to the dark depths of the asylum itself. It has a tiny window frame where you can see the wordAsylumtrapped behind it. Opening to the very first page, behind this window, is a photographic depiction of the asylum hospital.

I see her as the real tragedy of this story because she’s a prime example of the results of a selfish loser mentality. People like that end up destroying everyone who comes close to them. Why do I pick on her? Edgar is evil too, but he’s truly mad. It feels like he tried to control his madness sometimes. Stella never thinks about anyone other than herself and tricks others into thinking she’s weak or that she cares. Truthfully all of the characters are terrible people, but she’s the only one who threw her child into the mix of abuse and torture.Sounds like a fun book right?'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""*breathes deeply*Okay, I’m going to review this book from two different perspectives; as a social worker, and from a student.First, a summary. Stella is the wife of a psychiatrist and lives next to an asylum, with the alluring, wife-murdering Edgar on loan to help fix the conservatory out the back of Stella’s home. After a while they begin an affair, and surprise, Edgar manages to escape. What follows is a story of Stella struggling with her life, which includes abandoning her husband and child for what she believes to be love, and ultimately ending up in the same asylum she used to live next to. It’s a tragic ‘Gothic’ tale, told from the perspective of the psychiatrist who was Stella’s friend at the start, and who treats her at the end.Social Work Perspective:I studied psychology, I’ve been a social worker for the past 10 years. I know what grooming looks like, and Stella was being groomed by Edgar. He was emotionally abusive, and then later physically abusive. This was a relationship characterised by violence, and Stella was the victim. However, at times she is treated like she is responsible for Edgar’s actions. At one time the protagonist even asks why Stella didn’t see it and just leave? Seriously?! This review is going to be long enough, so I won’t go into the specifics around family violence…There was also multiple references to Stella’s sexual appetite (as if a woman can’t have one), and her numerous infidelities seemed to back up the low opinion the protagonist (and reader) had of Stella. This was a woman who had been groomed by a psychopath, abused by two husbands, and goes through significant mental health issues (which are not addressed as they should be, because you know she’s just a hysterical woman), and you’re still to believe that her situation is all her doing.Then there was Charlie, Stella’s son. He was the real victim. The way his parents tried to influence him, and neither could recognise or do anything about their child’s sadness. They were too busy fighting with each other. This does not make either of the characters likeable. In fact, no one in this book was remotely likeable.And then Stella’s treating psychologist wants to marry her when her treatment is done? Perhaps if he kept his mind out of his own pants and actually concentrated on Stella he wouldn’t have been too late in the end. Stella obviously needs help, but all the men in this book are trying so hard to either get in her pants or contribute to her misery, she doesn’t get what she ultimately needs. And she must submit to them, even if it's not what she wants. This leads me to my next point..........Gothic Literature Perspective:My thesis is related to Gothic Literature, more specifically, how women are portrayed. I know this book is meant to be set decades ago, and was written in 1997, but that is no excuse for the way that Stella is described. I have been reading papers that discuss some Gothic Literature having a ‘deleterious effect on feminism,’ and this book is an example of this. The woman is the victim from the beginning to the end. She shows no sign of growth and just when you think she has overcome what has happened to her, nope, it all relates back to the male. This is what some women may feel, absolutely, especially in regards to the patriarchy of the time. However, the continuation of the Gothic genre has to be adapted for it to survive.This book was obviously written by a man, because the insight into what this woman is going through is so minimal. The protagonist is a man, and this may be why the narrative could be so oblivious (and judgemental) at times. At one point he called Stella ‘the woman of sorrows.’ Essentially she has become akin to a dead figure, a ghost, not only to her husband, but also to the world around her, and even herself. It’s a tragedy, as most Gothic pieces are, but in the more modern day there has to be some kind of escape for the woman in order for the reader to see they can achieve greater heights if they can just find a way to break through the social structures holding them down. There were women in the early 1900’s writing stories that try to create a pro-feminist message and push the boundaries of what Gothic Literature was capable of. A book like this sets all that they tried to achieve back by at least a century.So, that’s my take. I almost put it down with about 30 pages to go, but I managed to drag myself through it. The only saving grace was some of the character psychology, especially in regards to Edgar at the beginning, and then Max towards the end. And I even consider that being generous. I’m not angry, just disappointed.

Lei, moglie dello psichiatra Max, che anche a causa di un marito freddo e totalmente preso dal lavoro, cerca di sentirsi viva in diversi modi. Stella si innamorerà di Edgar, ex artista e scultore ora paziente criminale della clinica in cui lavora Max, accusato di aver ucciso la moglie in modo brutale, ma si innamorerà anche delle possibili, e per lei nuove emozioni che Edgar le permette di provare.Ma scusa, provai a dirle, in cosa credi che consista il tradimento? Nell’andare a letto con qualcuno, o nella possibilità di distruggere, andandoci, la felicità di qualcun altro? Non è mai il fatto nudo e crudo, sono le conseguenze che avrebbe se si venisse a sapere: l’atto in sé è insignificante.Max è un uomo completamente assorbito dal suo lavoro e dalle sue ambizioni; talmente occupato dalla voglia di curare la psiche dei suoi pazienti da non accorgersi di chi gli sta vicino e dei problemi che iniziano a crescere in modo incontrollabile.Peter è il principale narratore di questa storia; psichiatra da molti anni nella clinica dove ora si trova Max, ha in cura Edgar. Nonostante voglia apparire distaccato, freddo e professionale, più volte durante la narrazione si lascia andare, dando voce ai suoi sentimenti e alle sue ossessioni più intime: Stella ed Edgar.Come Patrick McGrath sia arrivato a scrivere in modo così delicato, naturale e magnetico questa storia, lo possiamo forse spiegare pensando alla sua infanzia, trascorsa per la gran parte del tempo nel manicomio criminale di Broadmoor dove suo padre lavorava come psichiatra.La narrazione e lo stile di McGrath è veramente magnetico; nonostante nelle prime 100 pagine abbia fatto molta fatica a proseguire con la lettura, difficoltà dovuta alla storia, a mio avviso, lenta e noiosa in alcuni punti, non riuscivo comunque a staccarmi dalle pagine. Lo stile di McGrath è semplice, leggero, quasi asettico e sicuramente mai appesantito da tecnicismi vari.L’autore infatti non entra troppo nei dettagli della psicologia; per esempio, si limita ad accennare i meccanismi di difesa più noti come censura e rimozione, identificazione e annullamento, transfert e controtransfert fra medico e paziente.La sua identificazione con Edgar diventava ogni giorno più profonda. Mi disse che stava assumendo consapevolmente tutti i suoi gusti, le sue idee, i suoi sentimenti.Follia è un libro perturbante così come l’amore e le emozioni provate da Stella. La psiche dei personaggi è complessa, e trovo che nonostante sia difficile immedesimarsi ed empatizzare con loro, sia comunque possibile capirli, comprendere cos’hanno fatto e soprattutto perché lo hanno fatto.[…] non aveva paura di lui, ma della sua pazzia.Forse Follia lascia l’amaro in bocca perché tutti pagano le conseguenze dei loro comportamenti, delle loro mancanze e delle loro ossessioni e purtroppo, a farne maggiormente le spese è l’unico innocente di questo libro: Charlie, figlio di Stella e Max; vittima delle costanti ripicche e del costante disinteresse dei suoi genitori.Follia è una lettura forte, una lettura che destabilizza il lettore e che sicuramente può farsi apprezzare anche da chi non è avvezzo a tematiche psicologiche.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Where has this book/author been hiding all my life?

It was that layered, that satisfying, that good. I\'m only forgoing it to start Goodreads stalking the author for more books to add to my growingBetter World Booksorder.The book is a work of art, painted in cold, clinical strokes on an increasingly unreliable canvas by Dr. Peter Cleave, attending psychiatrist and friend to the female protagonist (or should it be antagonist?) of the novel, Stella Raphael. She is the beautiful, passionate wife of a distant, work-obsessed psychiatrist, Max Raphael, who has aspirations of becoming the next superintendent of the maximum security asylum where he works. Together, Max and Stella live on the sprawling property of the estate, where inmates work as grounds-crew members attending to their massive garden and Conservatory - both of which have fallen into disrepair over years of neglect. There, in the garden, Stella makes the acquaintance of Edgar Stark, a handsome, burly artist condemned to the asylum for the brutal murder and mutilation of his wife, Ruth. While Stella has been warned of the dangers in associating with the extremely jealous, delusional Stark, she chooses to abandon all caution and cultivates an illicit, sexual relationship that has devastating consequences for her family. I\'m going to avoid going into detail regarding the trauma and tragedy that unfolds because McGrath does a superb job in revealing these details through the prying eyes of Dr. Cleve.Side note: Are all Stellas sexual beings ruled by their animal instincts and the urging of their loins? The primitive, debasing relationship between Stella and Edgar drew a strong parallel to another sexually-charged relationship tinted with domestic violence penned by Tennessee Williams and made forever famous by Marlon Brando.I don\'t know. I really don\'t understand the whole women willing to take blows and suffer abuse for the sake of sexual fulfillment. Maybe I\'m not as passionate, as sexually driven, but I find nothing sexy nor irresistible about black eyes or slaps across the face. It\'s not a good look for me. I don\'t blame Stella for her rejection of Max, but I certainly condemn her for the abandonment of her only son (just as I blame the other Stella for the abandonment of her only sister, Blanche). Sexual obsession and self-absorption shouldn\'t excuse the abandonment of responsibility to dependent family members.The book was perfect, lending itself to the type of psychological interpretation that works so well with literary masterpieces like ""The Turn of the Screw.""

Perché alla fine nessuno viene risparmiato dalle conseguenze delle proprie ossessioni e dei comportamenti che ne derivano; perché c’è chi, ingiustamente, paga più di altri; perché credo che sotto questo romanzo apparentemente semplice ci sia una chiave di lettura molto più profonda.Non lo so, non ho ancora ben chiaro cosa ne penso. Quello che so per certo è che mi è piaciuto, molto.Però raga, mi raccomando, adesso chiudiamo gli occhi e ripetiamo insieme: “Follia non parla di una storia d’amore”.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Interessante, ma non mi ha rapito il cuore.

",Elena Ferrante,4.05,384522,3170,"Fiction, Historical Fiction, Italy, Literary Fiction, Audiobook, Italian Literature, Contemporary",331,19-10-2011,"A modern masterpiece from one of Italy’s most acclaimed authors,My Brilliant Friendis a rich, intense and generous-hearted story about two friends, Elena and Lila. Ferrante’s inimitable style lends itself perfectly to a meticulous portrait of these two women that is also the story of a nation and a touching meditation on the nature of friendship. Through the lives of these two women, Ferrante tells the story of a neighbourhood, a city and a country as it is transformed in ways that, in turn, also transform the relationship between her two protagonists.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'I received this book as a Christmas present from my boss over a year ago. In fact, everyone in the office received a copy – that’s how much our boss wanted us to read it. Before you start wondering what sort of wonderful place I worked at, let me clarify it was a literary agency, so such things were totally commonplace. So despite the terrible cover, and a rather idiotic blurb I knew it would be a fine book.No review of Ferrante’s book is complete without a mention of how no one knows who Ferrante is or even if she exists as an individual woman at all. Personally, I find this whole mystery of little interest as I share her view that all that the author wants to say she should say in the book and there is no need for the entire marketing circus.Ferrante’s Naples novels have been compared to Knausgaard’s magnum opus because both authors can be characterised by their hyperreal scrutiny which seemingly can only be achieved in autobiographical novels. The autobiographical component is official in case of Knausgaard and alleged in Ferrante’s. Additionally, Knausgaard has happily joined the marketing circus, which is why I find Ferrante’s presumed exhibitionism a lot more palatable.These books defiantly ignore all creative writing advice and cheerfully tell and not show, abandon all sensible plot structure and introduce as many characters as they feel like, not really caring whether that whole cast is in any way necessary. Neither do they have time for stylistic flourishes. Ferrante’s prose is bare; the language takes a back seat and is nothing more than a tool to the narrative that is pushed forward by its own urgency. What we are left with, though, is so vivid and authentic that no carefully polished novel could compete with it. This is great news. Rejoice, people, because in the age when it is possible to get a DEGREE in novel writing (without having to write anything of significance), comes a book which just doesn’t give a shit and still manages to steal the hearts of thousands.I don’t suppose I have to explain what this book is about, because you have other reviews for that. But in short it’s about the intense friendship and rivalry between two girls growing up in the impoverished outskirts of Naples. You might argue it’s a book about female experience, and to an extent it certainly is, but judging by how much men love this book, I’d say it’s rather universal. But then, I generally feel female experience, once stripped of all telling signs could be pretty universal, because, you know, women are people too. Anyway, to me this book was more about class than gender. That constant anger, violence, the ‘let’s get them before they get us’ feel permeates the novel. And the moral, if ‘My Brilliant Friend’ has a moral at all, is that you can take a girl out of the Naples slums, but you can’t take the Naples slums out of the girl. Make no mistake, though. This is by no means an emotionally manipulative misery memoir. This is a story of childhood that simply doesn’t know it’s underprivileged.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I have been studying Italian in my free time and so decided to try reading one of the most popular Italian writers of today: Elena Ferrante. There have been many articles about this author's mysterious anonymity. Her real identity is unknown except to her publisher because she wishes to have a normal life. I get that. Still, it only adds to the intrigue, as you can't help but wonder who writes these marvelous books. My Brilliant Friend is not the sort of book I would normally pick up as I prefer fantasy fiction. This is contemporary realistic fiction about two women who grow up together in the 1950s and 1960s in a poor neighborhood in Naples. The cast of characters is large, and for me, an American reader, I was missing some cultural context that made it a little bewildering at first. I read the book in English (because my Italian is not that good yet) and the style was both deeply intimate and jarringly matter-of-fact. The narrator Elena tells us everything about her upbringing in a neighborhood where harsh poverty is the norm and family violence is unremarkable, even, for instance, when a father sends a daughter flying out a second story window. Elena grows up side by side with her friend/foil/personal albatross Lila, who is naturally brilliant at everything and more beautiful than Elena, but who is held down by circumstances to work in her father's shoe store while Elena has a chance to escape her life through education. The book is a blow-by-blow confessional, following the two girls from their earliest memories through their early adulthood. The short chapters keep the pages turning, and by the end of the novel I found myself very involved in the lives of the characters. It is epic in the best sense of the word, and yet quiet and personal in its scope. At the end, there is a cliffhanger so brutal I immediately had to go and buy the next volume of this series. Wow, cliffhangers work! I should try them some time . . .""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""I tried. I tried. I tried. For 200 pages I tried to see what it is about this writer that gets such acclaim, but with 130 pages to go, I abandoned it - there are just too many other books in my waiting pile that I want to read.This book was chosen for book club which is why I persisted so long (I normally stop reading a book pretty quickly if it doesn't engage me).I didn't develop any concern for the characters, and found it really repetitive - different stage school/same response from parents/same competitiveness with Lila/ it just went on and on and didn't seem to GO anywhere. It was supposed to be the story of a friendship from childhood until womanhood, set in Naples in the 1950's - but I then discovered this book only goes up until the two girls are 16 - there is a sequel - and at that point I decided OH ENOUGH! I realised I was not even going to get some sort of satisfaction from finishing it. Endless minor characters proved annoying and I gave up trying to keep up with who they were (despite the list in the front of the book) as well as all the interludes with various boys.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Anne of Green Gables if it was set in a rough Italian neighborhood and written by Donna Tartt.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '‘What you do, I do.’A lifelong friend is a truly special bond. With roots of friendship growing from a shared childhood soil, continuing to coil around one another’s lives through all the pruning of teenage years into adulthood, and having weathering the storms across the years together, it is a bond that bears many secrets and scars but also deep understanding. A lifetime contained in a companionship.My Brilliant Friend, the first of the Neapolitan Quartet from Elena Ferrante introduces us to Elena Greco and Raffaella Cerullo—Lenù and Lila, though everyone else calls her Lina—as adult Elena plunges us back through her memories to trace the trajectories of their lives. It is a brilliant novel, easily one of my favorites I read this year and one that consumed my thoughts and emotions in its epic of adolescence. Here we find life in a changing world as ‘a sticky, jumbled reality’ and watch the ways various ambitions play out to survive it. Across the pages ofMy Brilliant Friend, we experience a vastness of a community through a portrait of friendship, with Ferrante’s prose perfectly expressing naked honesty and heartfelt struggles to achieve in a violent, patriarchal community and comprehend oneself as an individual instead of merely in the context of a close companion.‘There was something unbearable in the things, in the people, in the buildings, in the streets that, only if you reinvented it all, as in a game, became acceptable. The essential, however, was to know how to play, and she and I, only she and I, knew how to do it.’Ferrante’sMy Brilliant Friendmoves at the slow yet steady pace of life through the days of childhood into adolescence. The pace and introspective narration—which sets Lenù’s sharp mind like a scalpel upon all she encounters—lulls the reader into an intimacy with the characters as if you, too, have grown up alongside them and each moment of anger or betrayal hits all the harder. While the novel contains multitudes in its thematic scope—community amidst violence and class disparity, the struggles of girlhood in an atmosphere of oppressive masculinity, education, language, and more—the heart beating boldly at the core of this impressive work is an exploration of friendship. A very complex friendship at that, so much so that Ferrantehas admitted‘in its first rough draft, the story of Lila and Lenù fit very easily into a single, substantial volume,’ but upon writing realized how much nuance needed to be investigated until it became a four novel epic.‘I had grown up with those boys, I considered their behavoir normal, their violent language was mine.’Ferrante’s use of language is so direct, gritty and raw, often launching into a series of astute observations that leave you breathless. She has an unmistakable skill for crafting dynamic characters, their actions reading as so intimate and honest and the relationships so emotionally charged and complex. I enjoy how through the novel we see the side-characters also grow from children to young adults, not with a straight trajectory of unified personality but more a messy and amorphous growth that, in hindsight we can detect the a linearity but in the present can often be surprising much like how growing up with someone really is.The novelLittle Womenfigures prominently into the story and multiple themes, and I felt there was an kinship of emotional resonance between Alcott’s work and Ferrante’s in the way we are privy to the complexities of interpersonal relationships as they navigate towards adulthood.‘I feel no nostalgia for our childhood: it was full of violence.’The story takes us into a neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples in the 1950s and into the violence of abuse, power and poverty. It is also the childhood home of the author, and while she doesn’t see the violence there as unique, it does register more strongly in contrast to the beauty of the region:Since it is a city by nature of astonishing beauty, the ugly — criminality, violence, corruption, connivance, the aggressive fear in which we live defenseless, the deterioration of democracy — stands out more clearly.’-Ferrante, in conversation withLA TimesWe witness violence as rather commonplace, even amongst the children (a key early bonding moment between Lila and Lenù involves throwing rocks at boys), and toxic masculinity runs rampant. Told through the perspective of a child, we see how all the ugliness feels a natural part of their world, inseparable from daily life. Though early on we see a key realization when Lenù is shocked to find that Don Achille, the ‘ogre of fables’ is actually ‘a little out of proportion, but ordinary.’ Violence is everywhere and commonplace reality is far more menacing than any mythical creature.‘I would have liked the nice manners that the teacher and the priest preached, but I felt that those ways were not suited to our neighborhood, even if you were a girl.’Class divide is also inextricably linked here. Frequently we see resentments over class, or feelings of inadequacy, manifest into anger and violence. Or how those in power protect themselves through violence and intimidation. There are also deep resentments over the past and several characters have an awakening of the former sins in their community wrapped up in national politics and abuse against their own neighbors. It is not far out from the downfall of Mussolini and the fascists, which still casts a dark shadow over everything.Though in hard times, one often finds a companion to bear the burden and what better companion for the perceptive Lenù than Lila, a girl seemingly misunderstood but in whom Lenù find ‘the characteristic of absolute determination.’ Their dynamic across the years is something that will forever shake inside me and I found it such a powerful expression of the ways we tend to perceive ourselves through the fragments reflected back by others. Their bond is both companionship and competition, at least how Lenù perceives it, and she spends her life in constant self-comparison to Lila. It is powerfully portrayed how she always feels second best to her friend, and while she also find strength through Lila she also seems to be creating a sense of identity that can only be understood in the context of Lila. In this way, she is fearful of anything that separates them, finding that if Lila has a life without her she will lose sight of her own self as well.‘She stopped to wait for me, and when I reached her she gave me her hand. This gesture changed everything between us forever.’It is a novel teeming with comparisons and her entire coming-of-age is always measured against her friend. Lenù’s constant self-assesment of her body is contrasted to Lila—she develops earlier but feels slighted that Lila is uninterested in this only to later feel less attractive once Lila matures—as well as her academic success, feeling Lila’s studies of language despite not attending school surpass her own abilities and, essentially, Lenù’s sense of self-worth is that no matter how good she is, Lila is always better. I particularly enjoyed how language is so central to the book, but also an aspect that is both connection and competition. This is most notable when her pride in her own writing is shattered by a single letter from Lila she perceives as superior. It is suspected later that Lila reading Lenù’s article causes her to realize Lenù has indeed surpassed her, but we only understand Lila through Lenù’s gaze. Ferrante has said the original draft intended to give Lila a voice, but she realized it is more effective to be confined to Lenù’s impressions and anxieties so Lila remains as mysterious to us as she is to Lenù.‘She was struggling to find, from inside the cage in which she was enclosed, a way of being all her own, that was still obscure to her.’Returning toLittle Women, I find it telling that it was this book that set them off on their goals to create—to write novels for both but later Lila changes towards wanting to create her own style of shoe—and how, like the sister’s in Alcott’s work, they take different paths to try and overcome a society that has little room for the ambitions of women. The theme of trying to break outside the socioeconomic or gender barriers seems metaphored in Lila\'s condition where she sees the world as \'dissolving barriers.\' For Lenù it is a path of academics, pursuing and achieving far beyond the usual room given to girls. Yet, by the end, we see it has alienated her from the life of her neighborhood. Lila abandons school but chases a dream to create and rise out of poverty through marriage (also to escape a worse relationship). They both discover that they are judged for these paths and Lenù’s fear that she is never good enough suddenly opens into a different anxiety that she is too good for her own contemporaries that \'I had also been following daily a path that they were completely ignorant of,\' and now \'I had to suppress myself.\' Which is altogether a tragic thought as, now that she finally has something to be proud of as an achievement of her own not in the shadow of Lila, it is something beyond comprehension of her peers and makes her feel alienated. Her own teacher had long warned her away from Lila, seeing Lila as just another person who will be wasted in the whirlwind of poverty and violence that seems inescapable.‘At that moment I knew what the plebs were, much more clearly than when, years earlier, she had asked me. The plebs were us. The plebs were that fight for food and wine, that quarrel over who should be served first and better, that dirty floor on which the waiters clattered back and forth, those increasingly vulgar toasts. The plebs were my mother, who had drunk wine and now was leaning against my father’s shoulder, while he, serious, laughed, his mouth gaping, at the sexual allusions of the metal dealer. They were all laughing, even Lila, with the expression of one who has a role and will play it to the utmost.’The threat of violence and masculinity is constantly thwarting them. Lenu’s own struggles with her feelings for Nino are complicated by the sexual advances of his father, for instance. Lila is stuck in a bad situation because the wealthy and abusive Marcello holds his power over the fate of her family if she does not marry him. The shoes, which are a symbol of hope and ambition throughout the novel, are later transformed into a symbol of betrayal and a warning that all ambition and advancement is gatekept by men and at the mercy of larger powers of wealth.‘She gave off a glow that seemed a violent slap in the face of the poverty of the neighborhood.’I adored this novel. I\'ve had quite the run of great books at the end of this year and this is another headed straight to my ""favorites"" list. It is gritty, it is shocking, it is emotionally introspective, it is a stunning look at a whole community and most strikingly, everything about it feels so true and honest and intimate. I felt for Lenu every step of the way, I felt her hopes and Lila’s frustrations as if they were my own Ferrante drew me in so deeply into her work. There are some absolutely breathtaking moments of writing here, the whole final sequence especially had me shivering in literary glee and tension, particularly the moment where we get an unexpected insight on the ‘brilliant friend’ of the title. For me,My Brilliant Friendwas just that: brilliant. I’m already diving into the second volume and Lenu, Lila and the cast of character’s around Naples have completely stolen my heart.5/5‘We were little animals frightened of our own mediocrity.’'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '1 ""sweet Jesus...this is the first of four books"" stars !!!2018 Read I was Most Afraid to Hate AwardFirst of all a bit of translationIn English we say blahblahblah.

Hint: It’s just as good as the book!https://nowtoronto.com/movies/reviews...*****My Brilliant Friend, a.k.a. My Brilliant New ObsessionBelieve all the hype. This is a rich, immersive, deeply satisfying book that, like many great novels, captures a particular time and place with complete authority. I can’t wait to read the other books in the series.In a dirt poor neighbourhood on the outskirts of Naples in the 1950s, bright working class girls Elena Greco (our narrator) and bestie Lila Cerrullo survive childhood and adolescence, learning how to navigate school, boys, sex and the limited opportunities available to them because of their class and gender.Initially I found the book disorienting. The prologue is set decades later and involves people we don’t yet know. Lila has disappeared and Elena is trying to discover what happened to her. Presumably these books are her way of finding that out.And once the story proper begins, it takes a while to keep all the names straight. Who is Nino, again? Enzo? What are the grocers called? (It doesn’t help that only Elena calls her friend Lila; everyone else calls her Lina, and her birth name is Rafaella! Also: Elena is often called Lenu.) An index of the family names at the beginning proves very helpful.But Elena Ferrante’s prose is ravishing. It’s graceful without being precious, mature and knowing while still immediate and visceral. She literally plunges you into the lives of these children. Family vendettas take on the power of myth; middle school is a fraught war zone where learning goes beyond what’s in the books; each change in the girls\' bodies is registered and assessed in terms of their newfound power (or lack of it).Late childhood and early adolescence can be a painful time; the stakes are high; your identity isn’t yet formed. There’s a sense of danger lurking everywhere. One month that boy in class could be a friendly ally; a few months later he might spit at your feet, ignore you and take up your best friend. Every situation, not just a class assignment, is a problem to be solved.Near the end of the book, the way one character orchestrates her way out of one engagement and into another is worthy of something fromThe Godfathermovies.In its insights, rich texture and violence – murder, threats, being thrown out of a window – the book reminded me of Alice Munro’s early masterpieceLives Of Girls And Women.And several things will continue to haunt me:• The girls’ first trip outside their neighbourhood – when they “run away”• How the title is mentioned in the final section of the book (this makes you wonder who, exactly, is the “brilliant” one)• A scene in which the neighbourhood’s teens, all dressed up, cross into a fancier part of town and realize, with insecurity and anger, how limited their world and lives are• The climactic wedding scene, in which all the threads of the story come together – sex, romance, class, destiny – up until the surprising twist in the final line, which will make you reconsider a big chunk of the story• Elena’s introduction to the pleasures (and dangers) of sexuality• The idea of how we sometimes act to impress friends, mimic being courageous by thinking of others\' actions, or more subtly, do things while imagining our friends doing them• The longings, fears and sheer awkwardness of adolescence• The legacy of fascism, complete with stories about what family did what to whom, and the changing nature of Italian society• The idea of how education gets you ahead but also alienates you from the class you might soon be leaving behindFerrante (a pen name) has structured the book so carefully that an early sequence in which the girls try to retrieve their dolls in a sewer contains, in miniature, everything that the book will eventually deal with: lost innocence, petty jealousy, money, imagination, sinister men, courage, and the way that one person’s account of the facts can vary drastically with the so-called truth.Now that I\'ve come down with ""Ferrante fever,"" I look forward to the next novel,The Story Of A New Name.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Edit July 2024: I finally got the time to peruse the NY Times The 100 Best Books of the 21st Century.

It is a beautifully written novel, I do not deny that, but the best of the 21st century? Not by a long shot. I have a strong feeling that half of the authors's popularity comes from the mystery surrounding her/his identity.

I read something by the mysterious Italian writer,Elena Ferrante, who seems to be worshiped by everyone. Honestly, I was expecting to hate the novel, as I seem to do with a lot of hyped authors. The subject was not necessary something I thought I would enjoy and Naples is not my favourite city in the world. For the first 50 pages or so I thought, ok, another book about families and friendship. However, the writing slowly grew on me and I became enamoured by the novel. Somehow, the author made an old and overdone subject feel fresh although not much happens. How? Was it the matter of fact writing style about horrible people and events? Was it the complex and realistic portrayal of a friendship, with its love, jealousy and sometimes-even hate? Was it the excellent and vivid portrayal of Napoli and its culture, so well done that you could see yourself there, smelling and feeling what the characters did? Maybe all of it, or none. What’s certain is that I am sold and I am looking forward to reading the next volume which I already bought in Italian.Recenzie in romanaCitit in Romana, tradus din italiana Cerasela Barbone si audiobook narat de Adriana MuraruIn sfarsit am citit ceva scris de misterioasa si prea-slavita autoare italiana, Elena Ferrante. Sincer, ma asteptam sa urasc cartea, cum mi se intampla destul de des cu scrierile prea laudate. Subiectul nu mi se parea prea interesant iar Napoli nu este orasul meu preferat. In primele 50 de pagini mi-am zis, ok, o alta carte despre familii si prietenia intre fete/femei. Totusi, scriitura m-a prins incet cu incetul si m-am indragostit de carte. Cumva, autorul transforma un subiect banal si folosit des, in ceva prospat. Cum? Poate de vina este scrisul direct, natural despre persoane si evenimente nu prea placute.

Foto usata per il flano dell'adattamento teatrale in lingua inglese della tetralogia ferrantiana.Ho l’impressione che Elena Ferrante ami spiazzare il lettore, e da lettore, trovo che essere spiazzato sia una bella sensazione.All’inizio di questo romanzo c’è un ricco elenco di famiglie e nomi e relazioni: ma non serve, non è necessario, si segue agevolmente il racconto anche senza consultarlo.Nell’elenco sono compresi molti personaggi femminili e maschili: ma gli uomini (maschi?) fanno la solita misera figura che fanno nelle opere di questa misteriosa scrittrice – e tutti, incluse le tante donne, sono solo contorno, perché la narrazione ha ben al centro, senza deviazioni, due bambine che vediamo diventare adolescenti e giovani donne, Lila ed Elena detta Lenuccia o Lenù. Questa è la loro storia, quella della loro amicizia e della loro vita.Si parte dall’oggi, tra Torino e Napoli, con l’io narrante già sessantenne.Ma si dimentica presto il prologo, e Torino scompare, l’azione rimane a Napoli, in un rione di periferia e di povertà, si piomba e ci si immerge negli anni Cinquanta.E come dicevo, presto il prologo sparisce dalla nostra attenzione, e ci si concentra su cosa succede, e molto si aspetta cosa succederà. Si ha voglia di conoscere qualcosa che in fondo sappiamo già.Tra Lila ed Elena, io lettore avrei definito ‘amica geniale’ la prima: invece, è proprio Lila a usare questa espressione per Elena, l’io narrante.È la storia della loro amicizia, dicevo: un’amicizia che all’inizio sembra difficile, le due si tengono distanti, quasi separate – ma si guardano, si studiano, come se si prendessero le misure.E proprio quella più tosta, Lila, spesso definita cattiva, descritta aspra forte determinata fino alla violenza, proprio lei sarà la prima a tendere la mano.Anche questo momento è spiazzante, arriva non previsto. Bello.In una storia così calata nella Napoli povera del dopoguerra, aspettarsi dialoghi in dialetto è scontato. Invece, Ferrante evita, accenna appena, e rimane agganciata alla lingua comune. Come Lila, Elena Ferrante parla attraverso la scrittura:…non lasciava traccia di innaturalezza, non si sentiva l’artificio della parola scritta. Leggevo e intanto vedevo, sentivo lei.Si respira cinema, le immagini sono incise, nitide, anche piacevolmente stereotipate: proiettare Sofia Loren o una Magnani scesa all’ombra del Vesuvio è automatico.Però, è questione di poco, e Ferrante cambia prospettiva, perennemente affascinata da cosa c’è dietro e sotto, dal lato oscuro, come la figlia del suo penultimo romanzo, la parte cattiva, il lato indegno, perfino meschino.Come tra Lila e Lenù la grande amicizia è basata su un gioco continuo di scambio e rovesciamento, Ferrante sorprende e confonde senza nascondere, racconta personaggi che nessuna forma può contenere, che prima o poi possono spaccare tutto un’altra volta, come succede alla pentola di rame - con un'ansia particolare, quasi urgenza di tirare fuori, spiegare, che regala a queste pagine una piacevolezza di lettura inaspettata.Non ho nostalgia della nostra infanzia, è piena di violenza. Ci succedeva di tutto, in casa e fuori, ogni giorno, ma non ricordo di aver mai pensato che la vita che c’era capitata fosse particolarmente brutta. La vita era così e basta, crescevamo con l’obbligo di renderla difficile agli altri prima che gli altri la rendessero difficile a noi. Certo, a me sarebbero piaciuti i modi gentili che predicavano la maestra e il parroco, ma sentivo che quei modi non erano adatti al nostro rione, anche se eri femmina. Le donne combattevano tra loro più degli uomini, si prendevano per i capelli, si facevano male. Far male era una malattia.James Franco e la Ferrante Fever.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'From the age of two until twelve, I lived in Merthyr Tydfil, Wales. During the Industrial Revolution, Merthyr had briefly been the iron capital of the world, but things didn\'t work out; iron ore became harder to mine, the people running the refining works didn\'t adopt modern methods quickly enough, the town was too far from the sea. Everything fell apart, and by the 1930s unemployment was running at 80%. When I arrived with my parents in 1960, things had become a little better, but the town was still one of the poorest in Britain.Why did we move there? It was the time of the counter-culture: some idealistic peace protesters had decided to found a commune - I still have no idea why they chose Merthyr - and my parents wanted to join them. The members of the commune didn\'t get on, the usual story, and after a couple of years they disbanded. We were stuck in Merthyr, and that\'s where I grew up. I attended primary school at Heolgerrig, a little village just outside town. In summer, I walked to and from school, a pleasant trip that lasted about forty minutes. In winter, my siblings and I took the bus.There were two kinds of children at Heolgerrig. The smaller group was the contingent of middle-class kids, most of whom lived on the new estate just down the road from the school. They spoke normal English, though with a Welsh accent, and their parents had white-collar jobs. A couple of other kids also belonged to this group; the one I remember best was Avril Griffiths, the vicar\'s daughter. Avril was a fat, priggish girl with an annoying manner, whom I hated for all of the five years we were in the same class together. Her younger brother, Wayne, was a bully, and I hated him too. But the majority of the class was quite different. They were the children of the local working class, spoke Welsh by preference, and were poor, dirty and violent.Violence was an integral part of school life. There were fights all the time in the playground, and they weren\'t friendly; the kids generally wanted to hurt each other. The teachers made frequent use of physical punishment when they thought things were getting out of hand, or sometimes, I thought, just because they were crazy too. There was one particularly dangerous teacher called Mr Haines. He would yell at us when we didn\'t understand his questions: his favorite expression was ""Blocks of wood!"" I can hear him yelling it now. He liked to use his cane. The boys, even at age eight or nine, were already fond of playing sexual games. One day, the biggest gang started a game called ""Kiss chase"", which involved kidnapping girls and dragging them back to the boys\' lavatory. I never learned exactly what happened to them there, but when Mr Haines found out he completely lost it and thrashed all the boys who had taken part. I now realise that he only hit the poor, Welsh-speaking boys. I never got hit.But this kind of violence was only a kind of muted background noise behind the real incidents, surprisingly many of which involved permanent disfigurement or death. One boy in the class above me managed to put an eye out using some wood-carving tools; another was killed when he was showing off by the side of the road and fell in front of a car. A particularly memorable and gruesome story started when the school decided to retire the ancient classroom furniture, units which had the seat attached to the desk with a heavy cast-iron frame, and replace them with modern tubular steel tables and plastic chairs. We didn\'t much like the change, but the upside was that the old desks had not been taken away. They were stacked in a shed out at the side of the yard, and they made a great climbing-frame. Unfortunately, they had not been stacked very carefully. One day a pile collapsed and killed a young child, not one I knew. A couple of weeks later, a fire started during the middle of the night and burned down half the school. It only occurred to me much later that these two events might have been linked. All of the foregoing, however, were still comparatively minor incidents. The big one happened at 9.15 am on October 21 1966 in Aberfan, a few miles down the road from us. A large slag-heap, which hadn\'t been properly maintained, suddenly turned into a landslide as a result of heavy rainfall. It buried the local school and killed (I just looked it up in Wikipedia) 116 children and 28 adults. My father wanted to go and help with the search and rescue effort; we started crying and made such a fuss that we managed to dissuade him.Anyway, what I wanted to say was that I liked this novel very much. It reminded me of my childhood.[ToLe nouveau nom]'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""[4.5 stars]If I were to describe Elena Ferrante'sMy Brilliant Friendin one word it would be 'mythic.' The minutiae of Elena and Lila's lives into which Ferrante dives takes on these mythic proportions, pulling the reader along on a tense and frightful story. But at first glance, the story is anything but tense and frightful. It's a story of female friendship, between two lower-class girls in Naples following WWII. Ferrante, with precision and passion, recounts the lives of these girls as anything less than ideal. There's an underlying push and pull to their friendship that goes against the expected narrative of girlhood. It's compelling and constantly teetering on the edge of disaster, again bringing back this theme of myth and how each detail lends itself to something greater, something disastrous.We learn as the characters learn. Ferrante excels at establishing a tone fit to the story. When Elena, our narrator, is unsure, we are unsure. When she's jealous, we're jealous. She's spiteful at times, and compassionate at others. It all builds upon itself to create a vivid atmosphere that is only enhanced by the gritty Neapolitan setting.I wasn't convinced by the first half of the book. But the second part really sold me. And I think that if I were to go back now and re-read the beginning, I'd be much more comfortable with the characters, the setting and the narrative structure. It's disconcerting and disorienting at first, getting thrown into a world with so many characters and so little hand-holding. But I appreciate Ferrante's confidence in the reader. She gives you more than you might handle, but once you get a grip on it, it's incredibly satisfying. I'm intrigued to see where the story goes, so much so that I ordered the next book in the series immediately after finishing this one. I only expect the books to get better and better; and based on what Ferrante's proved with this one, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.First read: January 14-23, 2016Second read: December 23-26, 2016Third read: October 3-7, 2018""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""When did we all start talking about Elena Ferrante, guys? I can’t remember- was it last year? Maybe 2013? I know she’s been writing for far longer than that, but it was definitely only recently that she became A Thing. Whenever it was, we should have been talking about her sooner.And with different words. Better words. Words whose value hasn’t been sucked out by the marketing blurbs they’ve been a part of, with the same accompanying modifiers (if I never hear “compulsively readable” again that would be okay with me, marketing departments). Too many eyes will glaze over when I use these words that would once have excited the grab-the-keys-and-run-to-the-bookstore response this book deserves. And that might make you, like me, not pick this up for absolutely years after you read this.So I need better words. Words that will make you pick it up tomorrow. Because I still can’t believe I somehow developed the impression that this was a book that I could miss. How did I somehow think this wasn’t a series of books that I should have had on pre-order every time like it wasGame of Thrones?(… or, you know, something better than that given the quality of the last installment.)But in the absence of an unused vocabulary floating around somewhere I’ll try to convince you with the words I have, because- and please read this in the tone of your dad giving advice at a crucial life moment-I don’t want you to make the mistakes that I did, sonny boy.How do I love this novel? Let me count the ways…* * *My Brilliant Friendis the first installment of Ferrante’s Neapolitan trilogy. It is an old woman’s memories of her friendship with a girl named Lila in the slums of 1950s Naples. They are both clever girls growing up in the midst of a grinding cycle of poverty and isolation generated by the problems of the post-war, post-Fascist Italian state (and the pre-war, mostly-in-name-only Italian “unification”). Both of them, along with the other children of the neighborhood, have a possibility of escaping the cycle and breaking out into the new Marshall Plan supporteddolce vita- and some of the story is about that. But not mostly. Mostly it’s about what it’s like to be blessed/cursed enough to have a childhood friend who is the center of your universe, and how that friendship can literally change all the things in your life, and make you the person that you are in the process of becoming.Straightforward enough, yes? You’ve read that before. Sure…but then why is it so poignant? Why did I spend hours upon hours with this book yesterday, unable to put it down? How did such an ordinary story work such undeniable magic?There are many answers to that, but let’s start with this: The story. The plot was the most natural, organic thing I’ve ever read. She started telling it and kept on doing it without pauses for literary reflections or metaphors, or for pretty much anything that might send the “oh right, this is fiction,” signal to your brain. She let the damn thing be and run its course without interfering. She didn’t shy away from having her character be involved in all the quotidian things of childhood or adolescence- zits, dresses, best friends, boyfriends, finding out what bad words mean, and endless status competitions. But never once did she make it feel tired or like something I’ve read a zillion times. Nobody came equipped with signifier clue words or pre-packaged, recognizable YA storylines, with immature emotional truths being repeated in italics, in between descriptions of clothing and hair. And you know what was fascinating? There totally was a popular girl everyone wanted here, there were mean bullies, nerdy intellectuals, hot jocks, slutty cheerleaders, apparently motivationlessly awful villains, and our heroine was even intellectual and had glasses. But that never occurred to me until I started to write this review.This is mostly because Ferrante allows her characters a kind of full, honest emotional range of expression that I’ve rarely seen in books about children and teenagers. She conveys the pettiness and center-of-the-universe feeling that characterizes childhood without ever quite making you detach from or become disgusted with the characters involved. When someone’s doll is thrown away, and another character retaliates, instead of rolling her eyes and refereeing whose fault it is, Ferrante just keeps staring at both characters and watching them go through that moment and what happens afterwards. There’s no adult intervention, whether that’s with an adult character or with an adult narrator.As is typical with Ferrante, this is deliberate a choice that serves several purposes at once. One of which is to highlight the lack of fully developed adults anywhere in these children’s lives. This is one of the many effective ways Ferrante finds to seep you in the atmosphere of the Naples neighborhood where this all takes place, right from the beginning, but beautifully, dropping it in between the cracks of action and thought:“I waited to see if Lila would have second thoughts and turn back. I knew what she wanted to do, I had hoped that she would forget about it, but in vain. The street lamps were not yet lit, nor were the lights on the stairs. From the apartments came irritable voices. To follow Lila, I had to leave the bluish light of the courtyard and enter the black of the doorway. When I finally made up my mind, I saw nothing at first, there was only an odor of old junk and DDT. Then I got used to the darkness… We kept to the side where the wall was, she two steps ahead, I two steps behind, torn between shortening the distance or letting it increase. I can still feel my shoulder inching along the flaking wall and the idea that the steps were very high, higher than my own apartment across the way… There was an odor of sautéing garlic. Maria, Don Achille’s wife, would put me in the pan of boiling oil, the children would eat me, he would suck my head the way my father did with mullets…”Never once does she need to set aside pages and pages of description as some authors do, because it’s given to us in pieces like that, while we’re following the action, until we have a full picture of a crumbling courtyard of a creaky old apartment building on a beaten down street in a bad part of town without ever really knowing how we got there.She also does a lot, effectively, with repetition. Repetition shows us a lot about why the characters are the way that they are. The violence of the neighborhood, in particular, is depicted with a frighteningly normalizing banality. We see violence happen over and over again- not as an isolated, cinematic horror, the fright of one’s life- as something mentioned as an afterthought,“they argued, and then sometimes, after dinner, he beat her.”The deliberate use of “sometimes” was chilling, like we’re not even hearing about all the other times when it happens. It’s not even worthy of comment. What’s even more terrifying is the dispassionate, impartial gaze turned on it by a narrator who has never known anything different. It only occurs to the sixty year old character who is the actual narrator of the story about two-thirds of the way through to get outside of herself and mention that she realizes now that her neighborhood was not the norm- it’s like in telling the story she put herself back under the spell and forgot that herself. It takes something 2015 Hollywood-level cinematically, publicly violent for anyone to feel the slightest bit bad about something that happens-like throwing your eleven year old daughter out a window into the street.The pernicious, weed-like growth of a particularly violent form of aggressive masculinity is at the root of most of the problem, but its societal reinforcement and indeed, the respect shown for those who display it, is shown, through this enforced repetition, to be the true cancer that not even young boys with the best of intentions and a deliberate intent to break the cycle seem to be able to escape. (Not to mention the girls who never had a chance to begin with.)Something that further increased the powerfully true impression I got from her writing was her gentle use of not-quite chronological time. Time in the novel wavers into being, then very slowly circles back to its origin point until you’ve almost forgotten where you started. But even this tried and true literary device never felt like a literary device. Again, it was so well and seamlessly executed it felt like a natural, organic process that was necessary to telling the story. It was like what happens when someone is telling you a story and realizes you don’t have the context to understand it, so they back it up and up until they feel they’ve given you the whole story, and then only just remember why they were telling you the story in the first place.But beyond that, the prose itself: Ferrante has that magical Tolstoy thing. The power of it isn’t in the individual sentence, which I guarantee you will be perfectly ordinary, but a string of sentences put together in just the right order. It is almost never going to be a striking word choice that nabs you, but rather a continuous flow that lulls you into its depths so that you’re surprised awake occasionally, just realizing that it’s happened to you. I honestly can’t think of anybody else except Tolstoy when he’s not ranting or religious, or Austen when she wasn’t being mischievous or clever, who can give the impression of being so utterly absent, as if someone simply left a kind of recorder on that would let you see what was going on inside and outside of the characters’ heads.But while the plot is compelling enough, the hot, poisonous atmosphere and her rare gift for naturalistic, barely-there powerful writing are more than enough reason to show up, that's what you notice later, after you’re done and you can breathe normally again.At the time all you really notice are these girls. It’s Lila. Lila, Lila, Lila. If you’ve ever been friends with someone who was demonstrably smarter than you (or you were so convinced they were as to make no difference), then you know Lila. You know what it’s like to know that no matter what you do you’ll always feel inferior- whether they praise you or encourage you or not. It makes so much sense to me that Lila was the transformative experience for Elena. She’s a heady thing for a child to experience. She is a person who is seemingly born free of gaze. She’ll process what you say for the words you actually use- not the social status you have while you say it, not the yearning she has to be like you or not like you at all, nor does she care about the image she is projecting to you. One of the things the narrator worries about in Lila in 1950s Italy is that she doesn’t have the instinctive, eyes down response that the other girls do when they are getting harassed on the street. Lila threatens people with a knife, or simply asks them curious questions about what on earth they’re talking about when they do that to her. She literally stares down or completely ignores a gaze that is the all-encompassing foundation, path and walls of all the women (and, to be frank, most of the men) around her. That’s an intoxicating cocktail of a thing to be around. A possibly dangerous, even ruinous thing to be around, if you’re a smart, insecure teenager with an imagination and a constant societal message that you are not good enough.Like Elena, the narrator. Her character development was very cleverly done. She had us, and Elena, so focused on her friend that her own story seems to happen under the radar, in asides, as if just necessary for context and to get us to the next Lila story. Which is a brilliant way to depict someone with the kind of self-esteem issues and brewing existential problems that are the major driver of most of Elena’s choices. She becomes a person somewhere along the way, without even realizing it- she builds an entire personality around Lila, the only thing she can see as worth motivating herself for in her horrible little dirty world. But it makes her beautiful moment of self-awareness at the end of the novel all the more poignant. She is shocked to discover that a disappointment she has in her own life, unrelated to Lila in any way, is important to her. This realization of her own, independent being as a person means she is able to have her first out of body experience, and look beyond the isolation and suffocation of her neighborhood to see herself with a gaze that might actually benefit her, in the end:“I discovered that I had considered the publication of those few lines, my name in print, as a sign that I really had a destiny, that the hard work of school would surely lead upward, somewhere, that Maestra Oliviero had been right to push me forward and to abandon Lila. “Do you know what plebs are?” “Yes, Maestra.” And at that moment I knew what plebs were, much more clearly than when, years earlier, she had asked me. The plebs were us. The plebs were that fight for food and wine, that quarrel over who should be served first and better, that dirty floor on which the waiters clattered back and forth, those increasingly vulgar toasts. The plebs were my mother, who had drunk wine and was now leaning against my father’s shoulder, while he, serious, laughed, his mouth gaping, at the sexual allusions of the metal dealer. They were all laughing, even Lila, with the expression of one who has a role and will play it to the utmost.”But most of all there is the friendship between these two girls. The content of it is some of the most honest that I’ve seen. It’s neither a sentimental Victorian ode to sisterly support nor is it as cynical as some more modern reinterpretations of female friendship would suggest. It trusts you to understand that these are real people and to acknowledge that because you are willing to acknowledge it within yourself without ever telling you to acknowledge it. We know that the narrator doesn’t mean it maliciously, necessarily, when she needs a boyfriend because she thinks her friend has one, that she throws her friend’s doll down a hole because her friend did, that she feels better if she looks a little better than her sometimes. We also see that whenever something truly bad happens to her friend she notices it and she helps- she gets her through some tough situations when she has no obligation to. We also see how fixated she is on her friend, and how nothing is really worth it to her if she doesn’t share in it with her: she shows us what it means when your life is really, as literally as possible, almost entirely about your perception of another person. We see this so often in the context of romantic literature, but almost never in the context of friendship. I think the latter is far more commonI do not claim the novel is faultless. There were two moments where her assured voice broke and she fell down into the exaggerated metaphorical exercises I was so happy to see absent from most of the book. (Though one of those times is forgivable, because it came from a dramatic adolescent who dramatically drew out the metaphor herself in the weird, obsessive way that teenagers do. I also did wish that we might have spent slightly more time with the narrator herself, in her own home and her own life so that we might have gotten to know her better. But that was a reader’s wish for a sympathetic character to know herself better, mostly- that’s not what this story was about. It would have been the poorer for following what I wanted it to do. The faults were mostly the faults of the character, put there deliberately to emphasize a character trait.So perhaps it is nearly faultless after all. What did I miss? Maybe someone else can tell me where she went wrong, because I can’t find it. Or I probably could, actually, but I think I’ll be much too busy reading the next installment:The Story of a New Name. Which, I predict, is exactly what you’ll be doing as soon as you finish this book.Go on. I’ll get you started…..“My friendship with Lila began the day we decided to go up the dark stairs that led, step after step, flight after flight, to the door of Don Achille’s apartment. I remember the violet light of the courtyard, the smells of a warm spring evening. The mothers were making dinner, it was time to go home, but we delayed, challenging each other, without ever saying a word, testing our courage…..”(This book originally appeared on my blog at:http://shouldacouldawouldabooks.com/2...)""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'This novel has so much violence that it should come with some kind of rating.

It is the first in a series, and I confess that when I started reading it, I did not intend to continue with them — I was just going to read this first one to see what all the fuss over Ferrante was about.It took me a while to get into the book; there are so many families in the neighborhood, and everyone has nicknames that it was tough to remember who was who and who did what to which relative. (There is a cast of characters listed at the front of the book, but it\'s still confusing.) About midway through the book, I really connected with the two main characters, especially after they started going to school. I could relate to Elena\'s jealousy about Lila, and how she admired and imitated her strength. Occasionally Lila opens up and admits how important Elena is to her, and those moments are lovely. Ferrante\'s descriptions are so good that eventually it felt as if I had been living with these families.But what exactly is the story, you ask? Well, there are lots of them. There are stories about cruel boys in the neighborhood. There are stories about Lila\'s dream of making it rich by designing special shoes to sell. There are stories about the competitions at school, and how Elena and Lila would push each other to learn more. There are stories of Lila\'s family, and how her father would abuse her when he lost his temper. There are stories about the men who pursued Lila when she became a beautiful teenager, and how she risked offending a powerful family. There is the story of Elena\'s first boyfriend, and how she has to navigate high school. And finally, there is the story of a wedding.The wedding scene is what closes out this first novel, and something happens there that convinced me to read the second book. You win, Ferrante.Update: A Few Weeks LaterI have gotten so involved in this series that I am reading Book 3 and have already ordered Book 4. My advice to those starting out is to be patient with this first novel -- a lot of the events that happen in Elena\'s childhood have long-lasting effects, like seeds that had to be planted so they could sprout later on. The more I read about these two women, the more I admire them. I highly recommend these Ferrante novels.Favorite Quote""Right away, from the first day, school had seemed to me a much nicer place than home. It was the place in the neighborhood where I felt safest, I went there with excitement. I paid attention to the lessons, I carried out with the greatest diligence everything that I was told to carry out, I learned. But most of all I liked pleasing the teacher, I liked pleasing everyone.""A Disturbing But Incredible Passage""We lived in a world in which children and adults were often wounded, blood flowed from the wounds, they festered, and sometimes people died. One of the daughters of Signora Assunta, the fruit and vegetable seller, had stepped on a nail and died of tetanus. Signora Spagnuole\'s youngest child had died of croup. A cousin of mine, at the age of twenty, had gone one morning to move some rubble and that night was dead, crushed, the blood pouring out of his ears and mouth. My mother\'s father had been killed when he fell from a scaffolding at a building site. The father of Signor Peluso was missing an arm, the lathe had caught him unawares. The sister of Giuseppina, Signor Peluso\'s wife, had died of tuberculosis at twenty-two. The oldest son of Don Achille — I had never seen him, and yet I seemed to remember him — had gone to war and died twice: drowned in the Pacific Ocean, then eaten by sharks. The entire Melchiorre family had died clinging to each other, screaming with fear, in a bombardment. Old Signorina Clorinda had died inhaling gas instead of air. Guanine, who was in fourth grade when were were in first, had died one day because he had come across a bomb and touched it. Legion, with whom we had played in the courtyard, or maybe not, she was only a name, had died of typhus. Our world was like that, full of words that killed: croup, tetanus, typhus, gas, war, lathe, rubble, work, bombardment, bomb, tuberculosis, infection. With these words and those years I bring back the many fears that accompanied me all my life.""'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '“I am made and remade continually. Different people draw different words from me.” So said Virginia Woolf and this, the forging of identity in relationship, is very much the theme of Elena Ferrante’s compelling novel. Elena, the narrator of the novel, is in first grade when we first meet her. She lives in a violent and impoverished working class district of Naples where kindred spirits or role models are hard to find. Certainly not her mother – “My mother did her best to make me understand that I was superfluous in her life. I wasn’t agreeable to her nor was she to me. I found her body repulsive.” Then she meets Lila. Lila is a wild child with exalted sensibility and intelligence for her age. In Lila Elena finally identifies an ideal she can aspire to. The portrait of Elena and Lila’s bond is the novel’s masterstroke. As all around them the somewhat coarse uneducated boys of the neighbourhood seek to distort and shape the girls to suit their own masculine vanity – “dissolve the margins” of separation - the two girls forge an independence of spirit that is nurtured by the inspiration they find in each other. They create a compelling and exciting inner world together, a stage on which they both are able to dramatise themselves as the heroines of their own fate. The novel is the story of their friendship and Elena’s attempts to transcend her background of thrift and mean spirited bullying.It’s an unusual and highly distinctive novel (visually reminiscent of de Sica’s early brilliant films). Essentially because of the intensity and lucidity of Ferrante’s prose. She manages to write about the most prosaic detail with a kind of hallucinatory urgency and as such her voice hits exactly the right notes in expressing the joys and torments of adolescence when every day seems to hold moments of both pivotal humiliation and triumph, moments few adults are capable of perceiving. Thus the narrative is a constant high tension wire where the mundane relentlessly spills over into epiphany or violence. There’s a passage when Elena is writing about Lila’s prose style which would serve as the perfect eulogy of Ferrante’s prose style – “She expressed herself in sentences that were well constructed, and without error, even though she had stopped going to school, but – further – she left no trace of effort, you weren’t aware of the artifice of the written word. I read and I saw her, heard her. The voice set in the writing overwhelmed me, enthralled me even more than when we talked face to face; it was completely cleansed of the dross of speech, the confusion of the oral.”'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Much has been said about this book, the first of the Naples trilogy, and by many.I opened this novel with the expectation to be enthralled in a world I could relate to, with characters that would bring back echoes of my own childhood and adolescence and also hoping to be surprised by Ferrante’s unique conception of friendship.It turns out the book did nothing of the sort. That doesn’t mean I can’t understand why some readers feel attracted to it, as I detect a sort of addictiveness in Ferrante’s style that I can’t rightly place. My fault, probably.Ferrante’s ability to paint a dexterous tableau vivant of Naples in the mid-fifties is undeniable; its gratuitous gender violence, the pressing presence of the Camorra that threatens the lives of young and old in a modest working neighborhood, the weight of a patriarchal system that harasses girls of all ages… it all leaps off the page, and yet, and yet…My reservations arise from the lack of emotion with which all the above is framed by the two protagonists of the story: Lenu and Lila. They couldn’t be more different, Lila is daring, kind of a rebel, Lenu is dependant, a follower. And still, who is the “brilliant friend” in this story? The narrator or the narrated? Ferrante seems to suggest that Lila’s potential is subdued by her circumstances, but Lenu manages to flourish in them, as if she sucked her friend’s talent in spite of her apparent dominance over everybody around her.Promising, right?There is basis for a great story in this novel, one that could easily portray the true meaning of friendship, including its ugly side marred by envy and jealousy, but my response is undermined by the way in which Ferrante carried it through, which was, in my opinion, insipid in literary terms. Flat. Lifeless. I wasn’t pulled into the story, I couldn’t empathize with neither of the characters and I did find little narrative beauty in Ferrante’s unpolished sentences.I’ll confess that the last page didn’t urge me to get the next installment; I just felt relieved to see the abrupt ending that gave me the perfect excuse to let these two girls go on their ways without me.Closing the book felt like having eaten a bunch of junk food, easy to gobble up but knowing it will provide little nourishment to one’s body…or reading soul, in this case. So, no harm in doing that from time to time, but not on a daily basis.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""I just don't get the hype. I found the writing (or translation) incredibly choppy and the story overlong, repetitive and incoherent at times.There must be better writers in Italy than Ferrante.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""It was as if, because of an evil spell, the joy or sorrow of one required the sorrow or joy of the other; even our physical aspect, it seemed to me, shared in that swing.""Elena and Lila, a friendship born of necessity – the need to find another human soul that understands us, our longings and sorrows - someone to emulate, someone that drives each of us to become our very best self. These two girls, born into poverty in 1950s Naples, forge a relationship that is both captivating and completely authentic. There is something about a novel told from the point of view of an adult looking back at his or her childhood that thoroughly captures my attention and feels so convincing. Even if I cannot relate to the circumstances or the surroundings, the emotions are so very real and bring back such sharp memories of my own inexperience and innocent yearnings.With keen insight and skillful writing, Elena Ferrante has crafted a vivid account of two young lives struggling to rise above the usual fate of those born into such harsh conditions. The impoverishment and violence of the neighborhood are part of the daily fabric of Elena and Lila’s lives, but they dream of a life elevated above those around them. The key to achieving this dream – education.""In that last year of elementary school, wealth became our obsession. We talked about it the way characters in novels talk about searching for treasure… Then, I don’t know why, things changed and we began to link school to wealth. We thought that if we studied hard we would be able to write books and that the books would make us rich. Wealth was still the glitter of gold coins stored in countless chests, but to get there all you had to do was go to school and write a book.""Oh yes, there was a time when I believed diligent studying would achieve similar results! What little girl doesn’t dream of becoming rich or famous?! Both girls work hard, but it is quite evident that Lila is the dominant one in the relationship – academics come easy to her and Elena finds herself wanting to reach those same heights. She often feels inferior to Lila and it becomes her goal to keep up with her, but believing she can never surpass the brilliance of her friend.Of course, the competition between two coming-of-age girls doesn’t just end at schoolwork. The fragility of such a relationship is further tested by the attraction they hold for the boys of the neighborhood. In this arena, Elena perhaps feels she has an advantage over Lila:""In general I was the pretty one, while she was skinny, like a salted anchovy, she gave off an odor of wildness, she had a long face, narrow at the temples, framed by two bands of smooth black hair.""However, true to the nature of girlhood, feelings of inadequacy settle in and Elena feels second-string once again.""But Lila now had retaken the upper hand, satisfaction had magnified her beauty, while I, overwhelmed by schoolwork, exhausted by my frustrated love for Nino, was growing ugly again. My healthy color faded, the acne returned. And suddenly one morning the specter of glasses appeared.""I couldn’t help but wish that Elena would stand up for herself, value herself as an individual separate from her attachment to Lila. Lila, the leader and Elena, the follower – certainly a familiar dynamic in a friendship. I wonder who benefits most from these friendships. Perhaps Elena needed the competition to drive her own ambition and rise above her circumstances. But Lila too needed someone to ground her, give her some sense of stability in her own life. I think perhaps such relationships are fluid – giving and receiving on both ends at different times, always changing along with the trials and tribulations each experiences. Ferrante does an exceptional job of examining the complexities of friendships and this is what I found to be the most fascinating aspect of this novel. The ending leaves one with a question and the desire to grab the second book in the series. Without a doubt, I will do exactly that. I am eager to follow not just Elena and Lila’s friendship but also to learn more about the fate of the large cast of characters – especially Nino, Stefano, Rino, Pasquale, Antonio, and even the city of Naples itself.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Una maravilla. Elena Ferrante te tiene en tensión durante todo el libro, algo insólito. No había leído nada suyo, pero con esta me quedo con ganas no solo de terminar esta trilogía, si no de leer todo lo que ha publicado.Muy recomendable. Se convierte en una adicción, de las buenas, no podía ya hacer nada más que seguir leyendo la historia de Lena y Lila. Pero no es solo eso, me parece que Ferrante retrata las relaciones humanas en general, al hacer el retrato de estas dos amigas. Es la naturaleza humana, cuando dos personas se acercan tanto, cada una encuentra un papel que cumplir dentro de esa relación. Elena es la sensata, la que sigue estudiando, la que reflexiona todo. Lila es una tormenta en persona, su manera de llevar sus relaciones, con amigos, con familia, es violenta, pero no solo porque puede sacar un cuchillo y usarlo si es necesario, si no porque todo el tiempo está como en medio de una explosión.Quería esperar a conseguir los libros que siguen en español mejor, que lo leí en inglés (aunque la traducción no está nada mal), pero no creo que vaya a aguantar.La recomiendo con todo.------------Segunda lectura, después de haber leído toda la serie. Si se sostiene! :D lo sigo recomendando.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Born into a poor and violent neighbourhood, plagued by death, most people accept their fate, some dream, and a few make plans. For Elena, the narrator, studying hard becomes the likely route out. Lila, the shoe-mender’s daughter, hopes her fantastical shoe designs will one day bring wealth. Footwear is a transformative element in so many myths and fairytales, it seems apt: Hermes/Mercury, Cinderella, The Elves and the Shoemaker, Puss in Boots, The Wizard of Oz, and The Red Shoes.Image:Mythical winged sandals(Source)This charts the early years of Elena and Lila’s lives, as friends and rivals, bonded forever, whatever the future may hold.Location: time and place“We lived in a world in which children and adults were often wounded, blood flowed from the wounds, they festered, and sometimes people died.”The setting is utterly alien: 1950s (mostly) in an impoverished, closely interconnected neighbourhood of Naples, where people speak a slum dialect rather than “school Italian”, and the Neapolitan equivalent of the mafia,the Camorra, hold sway.“There were no written rules, everyone knew that’s how it was.”But it’s so vividly portrayed, filled with universal experiences (childhood friendships and fears, mythologising, dares, competitiveness, battles with parents, shame, showing off, puberty, sexual stirrings, fashion, slut and fag-shaming, manipulative and difficult relationships), that there’s familiarity too - despite the normalised violence and abuse.Roots and routesSchool gives Elena the possibility of a different life, but it increasingly distances her from those she is growing up with.“I had grown up with these boys, I considered their behaviour normal, their violent language was mine. But for six years now I had also been following daily a path that they were completely ignorant of… With them… I had to suppress myself.”When Don Sarratore publishes a book of poems and moves to a better area, she begins to believe it is possible to escape one’s roots - for people like her to succeed, even by writing (she doesn’t seem to consider it might be easier for a man).“Was it possible that only our neighborhood was filled with conflicts and violence, while the rest of the city was radiant and benevolent?”Nevertheless, Elena’s childhood means that long after she’s moved away, violence, death, and poverty are among “the many fears that accompanied me all my life”.Yin and yang“A continuous game of exchanges and reversals.”Again and again, Lila’s and Elena’s experiences switch: when one is happy or pretty or popular, the other is not - until it flips.Yet despite that, broad differences persist. Lila is wild and angry, brilliant and, eventually, beautiful. By age six, she’s taught herself to read, despite living in a barely literate household. Elena is scared and in awe of her, but decides to accept Lila’s superiority, while being determined to keep up with her:“That was my way of reacting to envy, and hatred, and of suffocating them.”Even in the context of school work, the vocabulary is violent.“My life was splendid but uneventful… while hers was dark but full.”It seems that Lila is the brilliant one, going to waste, while Elena succeeds through hard graft and being allowed to continue in school. But it’s Lila who tells Elena, “You’re my brilliant friend”.Dissolving marginsIn childhood, the girls are constrained within their tiny neighbourhood, but as teens they occasionally venture to more affluent areas.“It was like crossing a border. I remember a dense crowd and a sort of humiliating difference… The women: they were absolutely different from us. They seemed to have breathed another air… They didn’t see any of the five of us.This is a grimly and sublimely realistic novel, with an intriguing exception: Lila’s occasional experience of “dissolving margins”. It could be a type of migraine or a touch of magical-realism. Either way, it’s also a metaphor for the boundaries and breaches that run through the book.Image:Children playing in the street in Naples, c1950(Source)ScaleWhen I opened this medium-length novel, I was startled by the dauntingly long cast list. When I finished, I was startled that it just stopped, in the middle of a big celebration, with trouble brewing. That’s because this is actually an epic novel published in 4 volumes, following Elena and Lila, born in Naples c1944, from childhood to old age. This one has a short present-day prologue, 60 pages about their childhood, and 240 of their adolescence. I will get the other three volumes.Quotes•\t“Trained by our school books to speak with great skill about what we had never seen we were excited by the invisible.”•\t“She took the facts and in a natural way charged them with tension; she intensified reality as she reduced it to words.”•\t“The sea.

Go round by th' end o' t' laith, if ye went to spake to him.’‘Is there nobody inside to open the door?’ I hallooed, responsively.‘There's nobbut t' missis; and shoo'll not oppen 't an ye mak' yer flaysome dins till neeght.’Charming. Now imagine, for a moment, that the scene had instead been written like this:‘What do you want?’ he shouted in dialect. ‘The master's down in the fold. Go round past the end of the barn if you want to speak to him.’‘Is there nobody inside to open the door,’ I hallooed, responsively, in English.‘There's no one but the mistress; and she won't open even if you make that dreadful noise until nighttime.’It's more immediately comprehensible, certainly; but it's productive to think about what might have been lost in such a version. This is somewhat the situation you are in with Elena Ferrante's novels, in which the use of ‘dialect’ is made to assume gigantic significance, while never actually being shown to us.At first I thought the constant dialogue tags – ‘she said in Italian’, ‘he replied in dialect’ – were a device of the translator to show where Ferrante herself was switching between standard Italian and Neapolitan. But no; in fact, the original writing is all in purest Italian and those markers (in dialetto, in italiano) are just the same for Italian readers as they are for me. While I was reading, and enjoying, this book, I was also struggling to work out what about this was bothering me.The thing is, casual readers would be forgiven for thinking that Ferrante's ‘dialect’ is some ungrammatical or degraded urban street version of Italian; in fact, of course, Neapolitan is a sister-language with a long, proud literary and administrative history. The Kingdom of Naples isn't some medieval nonentity – it lasted right up to the Risorgimento, and didn't really join ‘Italy’ until 1861. Neapolitan is no more a dialect than the Florentine dialect which has been enshrined (arbitrarily) as standard Italian. (At unification, by the way, the proportion of Italians who spoke ‘Italian’ has been estimated at no more than 2.5 percent.)I put ‘dialogue’ in inverted commas before because the words ‘language’ and ‘dialect’ do not have any scientific meaning in linguistics, and the decision to call something a dialect is, in the end, a sociopolitical one. We see in this book that people speak ‘pure Italian’, ‘good Italian’, but ‘rough dialect’, ‘the thickest dialect’; Neapolitan is what they use for shouting, swearing, insulting, getting excited. Lenù's boyfriend frustrates her because ‘he never abandoned dialect, and in dialect it was hard to discuss the corruption of earthly justice’ and other high-flown intellectual topics; when he falls out with her (though this is actually at the start of the second book, not this one), it's specifically because ‘he heard scarcely any dialect in [Lenù's] voice, he noted the long sentence, the subjunctives, and he lost his temper’. Even the toastmaster at Lila's wedding is originally chosen on the grounds that he ‘had married a Florentine woman and had taken on the local accent’.Of course, people really do look down on minority languages, they really are associated with poor education and low social status, and to that extent Ferrante is reflecting the reality of the situation. (In Naples as everywhere else – my wife was always told off at school in Edinburgh if she ever used ‘heid’ for ‘head’ or ‘ken’ for ‘know’.) And yet so much of the novel is about overturning preconceptions about Lenù's friends and neighbours, about restoring some respect to the lives of the working class in this neighbourhood; the novel aims to give a voice to a community that a lot of people do not hear from or understand. While this is often powerfully done, the book itself, on a sociolinguistic level, is profoundly conservative. Something about this friction sat uneasily with me and modulated the way I was reacting to the story.News that RAI and HBO are producing a TV series of these books raises my hopes that a screen version will – perversely – foreground the language issue in a way that the literary version doesn't quite. Since it's being made in Italian, it's hard to imagine that the producers could duck the issue of using Neapolitan in the way that Ferrante can duck it in text – as a regional language, its use in oral contexts like film and music (’O sole mio, most famously) is, I suppose, more acceptable than in print. I get asenseof how Lila and Antonio and the Solaras sound – but it's distant, even allowing for the fact that I'm reading in translation. Maybe, on screen, I'll feel like I'm finally hearing their voices.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'A not so satisfying read for me. By many other accounts, a great book and writer. The first part of a trilogy beginning with childhood girlfriends who, come to find out, don’t get past the age of 16 in this first installment. And therein lies my problem with it. I wanted it to move into their adult years and become more interesting and relevant to me personally. I should state that I rarely enjoy reading about childhood from the child’s perspective for an entire book. For the duration, it read like the early pages of a novel you’re trying to get through so you can get to the main storyline. Half way in and beyond, I’m still reading about translating latin and struggling with studying and class exams along with the onset of puberty and its challenges. Reflections of poor children growing up in tough surroundings during a six year period of time. Then it ends abruptly, like part I of a big novel with no part II.

But it looks like I’m in the minority.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""My Brilliant Friend, the first in Elena Ferrante’s quartet about best friends from a Naples ghetto, is a novel about power: who holds it, how it is won and lost, and what happens when power shifts occur. It is a story of violence: domestic and cultural, physical and emotional. All this, in a novel about two young girls exploring friendship and adolescence in post-war southern Italy.Elena Greco and Lila Cerrullo are daughters of working class families, growing up in a crowded, poor, electrifying neighborhood on the outskirts of Naples in the mid-1950s. Elena recounts their adolescence from the remove of middle age, stating:I feel no nostalgia for our childhood: it was full of violence. ... Life was like that, that's all, we grew up with the duty to make it difficult for others before they made it difficult for us.Parents beat their children, brothers beat their sisters, husbands beat their wives, and the wealthy Solara brothers keep iron rods in the boot of their sports car, so handy for street fights.But Elena and Lila are part of a blossoming generation, one that—like the city of Naples itself—is rising out of the traditions of violence and oppression that go hand in hand with poverty into something brighter. Or so it appears at the beginning. By the end of this first installment of Ferrante’s epic Neapolitan series, it seems Fate lifts up one of these young women while holding the other hostage to her culture.Lila is a force that defies definition. A scrawny child, she is like an orphan in a Victorian melodrama: all skin and bones, street smarts and fearlessness. The neighborhood and its residents—from her family, her schoolmates and teachers to the boys who are enchanted by the flare of her intelligence and her eventual swan-like beauty—are blank slates upon which Lila mercilessly etches her vision, her truth.And yet, such promise in a young girl with a sparkling intellect is thwarted by her own ambition. Money is what Lila seeks to yank her from the doom of the women around her: marriage and children before they are twenty, followed by decades of drudgery, their beauty a brief flame snuffed out by duty, submission, ignorance. Lila’s childhood dream of becoming a famous novelist is replaced by the more practical plans of starting a luxury shoe business with her troubled older brother, Rino. But even that scheme is pounded out of possibility by their cobbler father, until one of Lila’s suitors steps in with salvation. Ironically, it is Lila’s beauty that offers her the kind of power she can’t reach even with her preternatural intelligence....something had begun to emanate from Lila's mobile body that males sensed, an energy that dazed them, like the swelling sound of beauty arriving. The music had to stop before they returned to themselves, with uncertain smiles and extravagant applause.The tension of female friendship has rarely been so sharply and tenderly displayed in literature. Elena is objective neither with herself nor with Lila, and the push-pull of loathing and love is keenly felt. From the moment Lila drops Elena’s beloved doll into a hole, your sympathies are torn between these two girls, one so cruel and strong and vulnerable, the other naïve and graceless. Elena follows in Lila’s wake, helpless against Lila’s fierce charisma. Although it is Elena who is granted the opportunity to pursue an education beyond middle school, it is Lila who directs her learning. Lila quizzes her, mocks her, competes with her. It is Lila who learns her Latin declensions first, and best. If Elena studies Greek, Lila checks out the available dictionaries from the library. By high school, Elena finds herself formulating her thoughts and arguments as Lila would, using her diction. Elena moves forward in guilt mixed with a sense of triumph—it is she who is offered the education, despite knowing the Lila is her intellectual superior.Ferrante’s writing is stripped to the bone, but the marrow within is so rich and satisfying. This world of post-war Naples is vivid and visceral, every line colored in with careful detail. Elena returns from several weeks of summer holiday to find...the sun had made me shining blonde, but my face, my arms, my legs were as if painted with dark gold. As long as I had been immersed in the colors of Ischia, amid sunburned faces, my transformation had seemed suitable; now, restored to the context of the neighborhood, where every face, every street had a sick pallor, it seemed to me excessive, anomalous.The family dynamics (and there is a helpful Index of Characters at the beginning) are free-ranging and messy, feeding directly into the sea of village life—secrets are on full display, feuds are fast and furious, and allegiances change as peace is brokered, then broken. These characters will consume your heart.My Brilliant Friendends with Lila seeming to give into the inevitable: marriage at the age of sixteen. But recall that this is a story of power. And this story has only just begun.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Posted at HeradasWhat you should know:The book is fantastic, and I couldn’t help but absorb it in just a few days. I feel like it really got at the core of human insecurity, gender and income inequality, female friendships, and our hierarchy of needs. Somehow it’s also a page-turner and an engaging story. It blows my mind that all of those things are possible in one short novel. I guarantee that it’ll get under your skin and soak in.Ferrante vs. Knausgaard:Even though I’ve only read this first novel in the sequence, it’s hard for me to resist the urge to compare Ferrante’s Neapolitan series to Knausgaard’s My Struggle.Both series are: multi-volume, non-English, first person page-turner novels spanning several decades of their character’s lives, first published in English in 2012, with subsequent volumes appearing annually. They both feature straightforward, simple prose, detailing the ins and outs of their characters’ lives, and are deeply, sometimes disturbingly honest in tone. They both tackle a lot of the same themes, but from inside different experiences. If you enjoyed one, I’d highly recommend the other. Especially if you're a guy who enjoyed Knausgaard, you owe it to yourself to read something similar, but from a female perspective. Ferrante’s writing really put me inside that experience in an empathic way.They are also vastly different from one another: The Neapolitan Novels are fictitious, set in Italy, viscerally violent, told in a mostly linear, chronological order, feature short chapters, supposedlygained a lot in translation, are written pseudonymously, and have a tight focus on the friendship between two female characters over the years.My Struggle is wildly non-linear, purportedly autobiographical, set mostly in Norway, meandering, has no chapters whatsoever, steeped in nostalgia, and is tightly focused on Knausgaard's view of his general failings as a man, before, after, and during his journey toward becoming a writer.For more on the similarities between the two works, I’d suggest Joshua Rathman’s terrific essay for The New Yorker:Knausgaard or Ferrante?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'تبدأ الرواية بمكالمة هاتفية تتلقاها""إيلينا"" من ابن صديقة طفولتها ""ليلا"" يسألها إن كانت أمه عندها، تنفي رؤيتها وتبدأ في طرح استنتاجات عن مكانها لتعرف أن الولد المكترث مدفوعا بالواجب لا المحبة بحث أمرها جميعًا ولم يجد الأم المختفية، يداهمها خاطر مزعج عن رغبة قديمة لصديقتها في الاختفاء كليًا، ليس عن طريق انهاء حباتها ولا تغيير هويتها، بل رغبة في الاختفاء التام كأنما لم توجد في العالم يومًا، تختفي ولا تترك وراءها شعرة واحدة ولا تذكار ولا اي شئ يتأكد منه أحد أنها لم تكن حلمًا.سألت الشاب إن كانت أمه قد تركت أي شئ خلفها، أي شئ يدل أنها عاشت هنا يومًا وجاء صوت الابن المذعور يجيب بالنفي، أن صورها معه حتى اختفت تمامًا، ليس لها أثر..أنهت إيلينا المكالمة وأحضر�� مفكرة وقلمًا وبدأت غاضبة محنقة تقاوم رغبة صديقتها في الاختفاء الكلي بدون أي أثر بعدما وصلا لسن السادسة والستين، وبدأت في قص كل ما تذكره عنها، عن ليلا..صديقتها المذهلة.هل تعرف هذا النوع من العلاقات الذي يتبخر أحد أفراده في ظل الآخر؟ خاصة لو كان طرفي المعادلة فتيات؟فتاة جميلة مجتهدة حسنة الخلق، وصديقة حادة الطباع بذيئة اللسان شريرة ذات قوة كاسحة وألق وتوهج يغشي كل شئ حتى تختفي صديقتها في ظلها ولا يلاحظها أي حد، ستحتار كثيرًا في فهم العلاقة بينهما، هل تعشقها أم تكرهها؟ كيف تؤدي بنا رغبتنا الفطرية في الحصول على قبول وموافقة من حولنا واهتمامهم إلى طرق بعيدة نفقد فيها أنفسنا، أو ربما نعيد اكتشافها من جديد.قادني الفضول للبحث عن الكاتبة، إيلينا فيرانتي، لأعرف أنها لغز لا يقل شبهًا عن بطلة روايتهاكاتبة رباعية نابولي التي صنفت من أجمل الروايات المعاصرة وصنفت كاتبها من أكثر الشخصيات تأثيرًا عام صدورها مجهولة، لا يعرف أحد عنها سوى الناشر، تكتب تحت اسم أنثي ولا يعرف أحد إن كانت امرأة ام رجلشغل الأمر الرأي العام لفترة طويلة دفعتهم لعمل لجان تحليلية لدراسة الرباعية لاستنتاج إن كانت لقلم واحد أم مجموعة من الكتاب، وعندما قررو أنها لقلم واحد شرعوا في تخمين من هي الكاتبة حتى أضطرهم الأمر لاختراق حسابات بنكية لكاتبة محتملة وجدوا أنها تلقت مبالغ كبيرة في نفس فترة لنتشار الرواية ليخرج الناشر منددًا بتلك المهازل وتبعث الكاتبة رسالة صوتية تذيع لتقول أنها حررت كلماتها ولا يجب أن تتبعها لكل مكانأدين لهذه الرواية بشفائي من سدة قراءة عانيت منها على مدار العام، أعادتني للجلوس على رواية متجاهلة ما حولي، اقرأها حتى أنام وأصحو متشوقة لاستكمالها.علامة كاملة بلا ترددأجمل قراءات العام، إيلينا فيرانتي..شكرًا على السحر أيتها الشيطانة المذهلة.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""What makes something a page-turner? This book is more than the sum of its (considerable) parts: Yes, the writing is great, the setting is vivid, the period sometimes shocking, the protagonist relatable and fun, the best friend one of the spunkiest, most endearing characters I've encountered, the supporting cast is varied and dizzying and each stands alone. But still: why am I gasping in shock when someone wears a particular pair of shoes. Why am I staying up late at night to finish?

",Sarah J. Maas,4.47,2063840,3143,"Fantasy, Romance, Young Adult, Romantasy, Fiction, New Adult, Fae",703,02-05-2017,"The epic third novel in the #1New York TimesbestsellingCourt of Thorns and Rosesseries by Sarah J. Maas.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's actions and learn what she can about the invading king threatening to bring her land to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit. One slip could bring doom not only for Feyre, but for everything-and everyone-she holds dear.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre endeavors to take her place amongst the High Fae of the land, balancing her struggle to master her powers-both magical and political-and her love for her court and family. Amidst these struggles, Feyre and Rhysand must decide whom to trust amongst the cunning and lethal High Lords, and hunt for allies in unexpected places.In this thrilling third book in the #1New York Timesbestselling series from Sarah J. Maas, the fate of Feyre's world is at stake as armies grapple for power over the one thing that could destroy it.","[{'rating': 1, 'content': ""202.That’s the number of times that the word “mate,” in any of its hellish forms, is used in this book.TWO.HUNDRED.AND.TWO.https://emmareadstoomuch.wordpress.co...That statistic alone should be enough to justify this one star rating. If you feel satisfied enough to just remove yourself from this review, run with that feeling. Because I have, like. Seven pages of sh*t to complain about.That’s if I’m efficient.And I’ve never been an efficient reviewer. Once. In my life. I counted two hundred (and two) uses of a word over seven hundred pages. That shouldn’t scream “rational and in control of her passionate fury” to you.So buckle up, buttercup. We’ve got some categories to run through.DISCLAIMER: This review is teeming with spoilers. It is also X-rated, due to the strength of my anger and the copious sex scenes in the source material.I HATE THESE CHARACTERSRhysmakes me cringe harder than Renee Zellweger in Bridget Jones’ Diary. (At least that movie has both Colin Firth and Hugh Grant to distract me from Renee viciously critiquing her own body and, like, spilling coffee all over herself or whatever.) He is capable of two actions, like a mildly impressive Ken doll: 1) sex person and 2) valiant hero trying to kill himself in the name of his friends constantly. Either he is full on f*cking Feyre (sick alliteration, Emma) or he must be actively prevented from jumping in front of poisoned weapons with the half-hearted motivation of Heroism To Save My Family (even if it’s not at all clear why doing this would save them, because whatever none of the plans in this book make a lick of sense anyway).Because, as if this book weren’t fun enough, it rivals the Fast and the Furious franchise for use of the my-real-family-is-the-one-I-made-not-the-one-I-was-born-with cliché.Like Rhys,Feyrealso manages to find time in her packed schedule of sex scenes and repetitive dialogue to be incredibly, incontrovertibly dumb. For example, when she traps Ianthe and ties her up or whatever, she spends an unbelievable amount of time indulging an evil-villain-revenge rant. Just enough time for her to be CAUGHT BY THE DAEMATI (a Cassandra Clare-esque douchey term that pretty much means “species of bad guy,” to the best of my recollection). So much of this book was me silently screaming.Speaking of the aforementioned schedule, it’s no wonder that that thing Feyre used to do called “painting” is dropped like a hot potato. She never does it, but it’s mentioned a handful of times in the beginning of the book. And then forgotten. And then, suddenly, almost at the merciful end of this suffering:“The movement so perfect that I knew I’d one day paint it.”We’restillpretending that Feyre paints? Between the same diverse selection of identical sex scenes, identical training scenes, identical war discussion scenes, I don’t think she has time for something so banal as a singular interest or hobby. Idk if we’ll have time; I think she’ll have to get to third base with Rhys in a perfumed bath later.At least Feyre is brave and strong, though. Which is why she’s “too tired” to do anything after a loooong day of watching other people fight in a battle, followed by Mor winnowing her home. So courageous. How does she do it.Plus, she’s a brilliant friend. Which is why, when Morrigan confronts her for lying, leaving, making her and everyone else fear she has died and also making Mor responsible for it, Feyre’s response is “OH YA??? WELL YOU HAVE A CRUSH ON AZRIEL.”Truly a depiction of a powerful woman for the ages.And I don’t getLucien’s appeal. Do we like him out of the same reason we like Draco? (I’m saying “we” as if I like either of those characters.) Is it an omg-he’s-just-trying-to-do-right-he-didn’t-know-any-better type situation? Because Draco is a child trying to impress a father who doesn’t love him and I still don’t totally buy that. I’m still not a Draco fan. And Tamlin is not Lucien’s daddy, although...maybe a more interesting book if he were.CassianandAzrielare both flat and boring.Amrenis characterized so inconsistently that it’s impossible for me to know whether I like her or not. (I’m going to say “not” - seems like a safer bet.)Nestais almost cool, but the whole I Am Mean And Hard And Damaged thing goes too far. AndElainjust floats around and lets things happen to her.Morrigan, never all that interesting, now just represents the worst bisexuality rep I’ve ever read.It’s never a good sign when you’re praying for characters to die in battle just so you can catch a f*cking break.But guess what. None of them do.THE WRITING SUCKS, ON BOTH A COPYEDITING LEVEL AND A SUBSTANTIVE LEVELI truly believe that whatever team of sad sacks was assigned to copyedit this book was physically unable to attentively read it. And I cannot blame them. But it does allow for some hilarious mistakes to make it through these dull, dull pages.Example: “She did not avert her eyes from the Morrigan.” That pesky “the” makes her seem like a pro wrestler, or someone with a fun nickname, rather than the personification of the worst bi rep ever to grace young adult pages. But we’ll get to that.There are so many ellipses and dashes and italicizations and...other - ways: ofbreakingup the TEXT that it actually gave me motion sickness. On top of everything else this book has made me suffer through.Maybe if a copyeditor had found the strength to make it through this book, they could have stopped the way SJM insists on using the term “Hybern.” IT MEANS SO MANY THINGS. “Hybern” is used as the nomer of the evil king, the word for his people, the name of his kingdom, and the title of the land it’s situated on. That is just...basic bad worldbuilding, no?Also, a monster creature thing described as having no eyelids narrows its eyes. This inspired a fifteen minute long discussion with my roommates on whether eyes can narrow without eyelids. We came to a unanimous consensus: no, they cannot.Also, asValpointed out in her amazing review of this book, the words “vulgar gesture” are used over. And over. And over again. WHAT DO THESE USES MEAN. WHY DO THEY CONSTANTLY INSPIRE LAUGHTER IN WHATEVERGLORIFIED PROPCHARACTER WHO HAPPENS TO BE NEARBY. IS THIS TACTIC SUPPOSED TO REPLACE ACTUAL JOKES OR BANTER? Because it doesn’t. It just makes me angry, and also confused, which makes meeven angrier.And who thought that was even possible.WHAT IS THIS ATTEMPT AT HIGH FANTASY LANGUAGEExcept then, y’know, Rhys and Feyre and the Gang are also so hip and cool and up to date that this book uses the word “fuckable,” a word so slang-y that my laptop recognizes it as a typo for “suckable” or “faceable,” whatever the hell those words are.Otherwise, the only other remarkable attempt at making this any different from the way humans speak in 2017: the use of the word “male.”Women are sometimes called “females” in this, but are also called women and girls and whatnot. Men, on the other hand, are absolutely only called males. There’s an amazing moment when SJM refers to Rhys as a man, and then instantly, like, corrects herself. So it reads on the page as “man - male -”It makes no sense. I love it.It’s truly the little things.THE END OF THIS BOOK IS JUST A LISTING OF CLICHESAs the war we’ve waited for finally arrives, and so does the time for motivational speeches and tragic goodbyes and other things that fail to make me feel something, SJM loses it entirely.Nearly every line of dialogue in this section is just a cliché, and so I will copy and paste them here, for your perusal and accompanying amusement.“Leave this world…a better place than how you found it.”“One life may change the world.”“I believe everything happens for a reason.”“It is the family you make, not the one you are born into, that matters.”“Light can be found even in the darkest of hells.”“The great joy and honor of my life has been to know you.”“I wasn’t sure if in the entire history of Illyria, there had ever been such a discussion.”So bad. And, therefore, so good.LET’S LAUGH AT DUMB THINGSThe moments when this may or may not be attempting to instill some sort of entertainment or amusement in its reader do not work at all. Luckily, we have something much better: Really dumb stuff. It is much more fun (and nourishing to the very soul, like a bowl of chicken soup - so pretty much the series of books “Chicken Soup for the Soul”) to laugh at something unintentional and dumb than it is to laugh at a cheap joke. This is why the show America’s Funniest Home Videos has been on for twenty-eight seasons, and like a thousand interchangeable bad sitcoms are canceled every year.For example, this passage. Feyre and Rhysand are apart, blah blah blah, it’s the tragedy of the century (or millennium, since these boring ass people live for infinity, because there is no justice in this world). Unsurprisingly, they use their mind control powers for a saintly motivation: sexting. Which is already so hilarious. But it gets even better, because:“I sent back an image of me sticking out my tongue at him.My clothes were back on when his answer arrived.Like mine, it was wordless, a mere image. Like mine, Rhysand’s tongue was out.But it was occupied with doing something else.”I choose to interpret this statement the same way a middle schooler interprets the existence of performer Marilyn Manson based on a shady rumor he once heard about a surgery to remove three ribs. I believe that this is incontrovertible evidence that Rhysand can suck his own d*ck. WHAT ELSE COULD HE POSSIBLY BE DOING. WHAT COULD IT POSSIBLY BE OCCUPIED WITH. SJM I JUST WANNA TALK.But just as often as I was making myself laugh by making Rhys my YA fantasy version of Marilyn Manson, I was being equally amused by seemingly innocuous lines. Like when Eris, scary villain/abuser extraordinaire, was bidding The Night Gang adieu and said, “See you at the meeting in twelve days.” I MEAN. WHAT. WHO SPEAKS LIKE THAT. Even dialogue is just an opportunity to force an info dump. You guys, seriously: this book isso poorly written.LET’S SCREAM ABOUT DUMB THINGSSometimes, or most of the time depending on how you look at it, I do not want to laugh at the dumb things. Sometimes I am incapable of it, because this book is an ungodly length and so much of it is long-term stupidity.Chapter 45, for example. Or, as I like to call it, “That Meeting in Twelve Days Finally Happens.” Yes, this book is so boring that we are expected to anticipate an actual, literal meeting. Sure, it’s a meeting between high lords to talk about war, but it’s still a sit-down political discussion. And also it’s just the same endless repetitive cycle of insult dialogue feat. fun moments of The Night Gang being the least convincing people on the entirety of the Earth.There’s an especially great moment in that adrenaline-inducing conference. For the 800 pages leading up to it, Rhys is all,“Ok, Feyre. Listen up. Number one thing - just don’t show your powers, k? Long story short the Powerful Men are going to get pissy and then…well y’know these negotiations are the most important thing to happen in hundreds of years, which I should know because I’ve been alive for that long, even though you’re, what, fresh outta adolescence? Anyway just the only thing you should do is not show your powers.”To which Feyre’s response is,“Got it. *shows powers instantly*”YES. Feyre shows her powers at the meeting!! So quickly!!! She doesn’t even try all that hard, and, as promised, it almost derails the nonstop excitement of this much-anticipated civilized forum! Almost. Except then everything works out, as it always does, by Feyre saying something totally normal, 6/10 at best, and everyone being like “wow omg...who is this girl...she is so smart and brave and honest and we respect her so much” so that Rhys can be like “that’s my mate lol.”IRRELEVANT COMPLAININGThe only way to make the experience of reading a deeply unpleasant, extremely long book worse is to publish that book with goddamn tissue paper pages. This was like reading the Bible but without the action. And with a whole lot more smut.I’m tucking this quote in this section too, because I don’t know if I’m being persnickety, but at one point, it’s said that“Only a madman would wield the might of his army just to get revenge on three women.”And my question is, why use the word “women”? Why not “people”? Is it more insane if it’s women? Why is that? TELL ME WHY. REALLY I JUST WANNA TALK.PLOTLINE? WHAT PLOTLINEThis book is just...so boring.There are countless info dumps, which, I mean. There’s no excuse for that in a third book. This was going to be the last book in the series, when there was still hope in the world and I prayed that somehow SJM actually was writing these books for some sort of artistic fulfillment rather than money. How, I ask you, would there still be so much sh*tty worldbuilding in the last book in a series?OH YES, THIS BOOK IS DEFINITELY WOKE AND NOT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE OF THAT ENTIRELYSJM has been getting a lot of sh*t lately for her white/straight/cis narratives. So it’s no surprise that she would try to get those pesky activists off her back this time. Unfortunately, she does a remarkably bad job.This book is all straight people except for LGBT+ relationships based on sex alone, or in an unequal relationship wherein one person has authority over another. (Examples: a high lord whose bisexuality extends purely to the fact that he’s into threesomes; a military captain dating his high lord/commander/boss.)Plus, there’s bisexuality rep so terrible it took me hours to make it through a handful of pages. But that gets a category of its own.I also shouldn’t be surprised at the redemption of abusers in this book. Because Tamlin, in ACOTAR, was just a Nice Guy. Fine. But the fangirls loved a certain bad boy guest star with purple eyes. So, instead of creating a love triangle or transitioning between love interests like a normal person, SJM made him into an actual abuser. A villain.That’s also fine. But you can’t just redeem him like you could redeem the unloved side of a love triangle. Because you made him into a genuinely bad person.Unfortunately, SJM must have missed that memo. She must have missed it three times, actually, because Eris also gets redemption (and a throne!). As does his enabler brother, Lucien. Wonderful. Abuse apologists for the win.But this book is totally, definitely feminist, right??? I mean, female protagonist! War plotline! It must be, by default! So when Cassian says“I told you that the moment we started letting females into our group, they’d be nothing but trouble”, and woke king Rhys responds,“You actually said you needed a reprieve from staring at our ugly faces, and that someladieswould add some much needed prettiness for you to look at all day.”it’s totally fine!So it’s an utter shock that this narrative also lives nearly entirely within the bounds of gender roles. Reading about men (Rhys, Cassian, Azriel, all the high lords) fighting in battle while the women (Feyre, Mor, Elain, Nesta, Cresseida) watch and tend to the wounded later is sorefreshing. Doesn’t make me want to blow my brains out at all.And no, Mor being assigned to babysit Feyre later on, only heading into battle because Feyre tricks her into fighting so she can sneak away does not make it better, thanks.This is definitely, certainly the feminist YA fantasy you’ve been waiting for, folks.THE WORST BI REP EVER TO HIT THE SHELVES, WHICH IS INSANE BECAUSE WHEN IS THERE E V E R GOOD BI REPBut I haven’t mentioned the most unforgivable thing yet. The thing that made this book my first SJM one-star, after giving every other book I’ve read by her two stars. The thing that actually made me feel real hatred and fury and, worst of all, sadness.Truly, the worst bisexual representation I have ever read comes in the final chapters of this book. I’ve read a lot of bad bisexual rep. And it’s endlessly upsetting. But none of it felt quite like this.Apparently, Sarah J. Maas decided in the third book that she wanted to stop getting sh*t for her heteronormativity. So she decided to take a character who had been established as straight, and make her bi.So she took this character, Morrigan. She makes Morrigan cry. She writes Morrigan’s impassioned speech to Feyre. This is Morrigan’s coming out, for the first time. Morrigan says that she prefers women. To the point that she is only capable of feeling romantic love for a women.But occasionally, she will force herself to sleep with a man. In order “to keep people from looking too closely.” Instead of telling the man who has been in love with her for centuries that she doesn’t love him back, won’t ever love him back, she forces herself to sleep with men when he’ll know that she’s done it, so that she still seems straight but he’ll know she doesn’t love him.And the author dubs it bisexuality.I hate that she felt entitled to use this underrepresented, misunderstood sexuality as a playing piece in her own quest to be well-liked. I hate that the hundreds of thousands of people who read this book have been given this depiction of bisexuality. And I hate that Sarah J. Maas will keep writing wildly successful books. Books in this very series, depicting this character in this way and calling it “bisexuality.”It’s unfair. It’s awful. And I am never, never, never going to forget that it happened.Bottom line: I didn’t expect to like this book. But I also didn’t expect it would become one of my least favorite books I’ve ever read.----pre-reviewI did it.Everyone told me I couldn't do it.Just DNF it,they said.You're being insane,they said.Why would you force yourself through 700 pages of misery? Actually, didn't you hate the second book? Why did you even pick up the third book, you f*cking fool?And you know what? They were right, because that was stupid.But also THEY WERE WRONG, because I FINISHED THIS GODDAMN NIGHTMARE OF A NOVEL.It may have taken me eight months. But it's over.Review (of a lifetime) to come----currently-reading updatesTHIS MONTH IS THE MONTH WHEN I FINISH THIS BOOK.----150 pages in and already bored as hell.Cauldron help me make it through""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': '*Do I need to remind you to be civil? No, I don’t. Good kids.“You High Lords really do love your melodrama, don’t you?”(As if I hadn\'t got enough ammo already.)For honesty\'s sake, the last two thirds of the book I could only bring myself to skim through (and I\'m quite proud of myself for managing even that). The first third had accurately enlightened me as to what I was to expect, and my (abysmally low) expectations were met point by point.We girls of the SmutClub weren\'t able to do a proper buddy read as we did last year with ACoMaF due to real life kicking our asses. However, I\'m sure you don\'t want to missSarah\'sandReyes\'sreviews, andEmer\'scall for honesty and good sense when it comes tothe target market of this series(and of theThrone of Glassseries too, at this point) perfectly highlights a problem I haven\'t been able to wrap my mind around since it first arose.•First of all, I\'d like to take a moment to answer a question that no one asked but that I think it fair to take into account nonetheless, said question being, ""If you evidently don\'t like Maas\'s books, why do you keep reading them?""Very good point indeed.I used to consider her books a guilty pleasureuntil, well, yesterday. The word ""pleasure"" in that expression, though, baffled me very much even before. More correctly, reading her was an experience akin to getting your first period at school and noticing too late (mortallyembarrassing), while ranting about it later was an honest if inclement exercise in snark, just as reading other people\'s reviews with previous knowledge of the book was pure amusement, be them positive or negative, and this latter reason is probably what always convinced me to suffer a little for the greater fun. Sometimes I also enjoyed some parts, so mine wasn\'t all sadism, after all. ButA Court of Wings and Ruin? (I still have no clue about what this absurd title is supposed to mean.) This one wassheer torture.A bore. Like havinga pitchfork repeatedly shoved in the eyeballs.(I should refer you tomy review ofA Court of Mist and Fury, which already contains many, if not all, of the issues I had with this final installment too, because since I\'ve read that book with way more attention than I did ACoWaR, you\'d probably find that one more specific and generally accurate.)•The writing gets worse. It\'s a miracle -or whatever its opposite would be called. Saying that it\'smelodramaticdoesn\'t begin to describe it anymore; admitting that its basic rule isemotional manipulationwould be such an understatement, my fingers itch. Everything is amplified, everything is exaggerated, everything makes twice the noise that it should make proportionally to its dimensions. Which is to say,everything becomes grotesque.Ridiculousness abounds, especially when matters of the heart (you haveno ideahow much I struggled not to use some other word that would have been more fit to the case at hand there) are concerned. I\'ll make just two quick examples both taken from chapter 14.The examples may contain mild spoilers.“Where are my sisters?” The thought clanged through me, jarring as a pealing bell.Rhys paused, hand slipping from my hair as his smile faded. “At the House of Wind.” He straightened, swallowing—as if it somehow checked him. “I can—take you to them.” Every word seemed to be an effort.But he would, I realized. He’d shove down his need for me and take me to them, if that was what I wanted. My choice.It had always been my choice with him.”To spell it out, what Feyre\'s voice is implying here is that one point in the never-ending list of reasons why Rhysand is worth worshipping is that he is able to keep it in his pants ten minutes longer so that she can go say hello to her sisters, whom she hasn\'t seen in more than a month and who, last she saw them, had just undergone a devastating trauma. It is evident that Maas isstillshoving in our faces that wemustabsolutely love Rhysand... a pity she isstillpicking all the wrong reasons, because what I think when I read a scene like this is ""Someone please lock him away"" (and I\'m being kind).Example number two(trigger warning: this one\'s rather disgusting. I for sure gagged once or twice.), this oneto show what I mean by ""overwritten"" and ""grotesque"" and ""ew"":“You have a choice,” he murmured against my cheekbone. “Either I lick every inch of you clean …” His hand grazed the tip of my breast, circling lazily. As if we had days and days to do this. “Or you can get into the bath that should be ready by now.”I pulled away, lifting a brow. “Are you suggesting that I smell?”Rhys smirked, and I could have sworn my core pounded in answer. “Never. But …” His eyes darkened, the desire and amusement fading as he took in my clothes.“There is blood on you. Yours, and others’. I thought I’d be a good mate and offer you a bath before I ravish you wholly.”I huffed a laugh and brushed back his hair, savoring the silken, sable strands between my fingers. “So considerate. ThoughI can’t believe you kicked everyone out of the house so you could take me to bed.”“One of the many benefits to being High Lord.”“What a terrible abuse of power.”That half smile danced on his mouth. “Well?”“As much as I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood…”His eyes gleamed with the challenge, and I laughed again. “Normal bath, please.”You see what I mean? Maas triesso hardto write steamy, sexy moments that she stopped noticing that the way she writes them became (a long time ago I dare say)utterly ridiculous. What sane person in their right mind would ever say ""I’d like to see you attempt to lick off a week’s worth of dirt, sweat, and blood off me?""Many, many,many, if not all, of the problems this book has are linked to the writing,silly,childish,bloated,cheesy. It sourseverything.•Not totally disconnected from this, there is also the insistence with whichFeyre\'s bliss with her Court of Friends and Familyis continually trotted out, especially if there\'s the opportunity to describe it through someone else\'s point of view, as it happens with Lucien\'s in the first part of the book.There is a reason if one of the axioms of storytelling is that talking about happiness is difficult: it\'s uninteresting, poor of nuances, syrupy: people don\'t want to hear about happiness. “Happy families are all alike,” after all.•One of the main points ofFeyre\'s character arcshould be her discovery of independence and of her inner strength, of the fact that she doesn\'t necessarily need anyone, especially a man, to guide and direct her every step. A shame the impression we get from the whole series isthe very opposite: Feyre\'s character growth (not automatically meant as an upward trajectory) seems to be irreversiblyconnected to the ""male"" who is (even virtually) at her side. In this book, she and Rhysand are pretty much a single entity. Can I feel a tinge of outrage at this, please? We women are very able to be complete on our own, thank you very much. The whole""mating system"" (I can\'t even, it\'s too ridiculous)has me not exactly convinced in this regard too. Various characters throughout the book keep having this attitude, especially towards Feyre, that impliesa vision of women as mere objects of sexual interest, pawns in a purely male game of lust and authority, and they are never challenged because their brain is full of crap, but simply because they insult Feyre–and not even Feyre as herself, but Feyre as Rhysand\'s mate, like during the meeting of the High Lords in chapter 46, when someone calls Feyre ""human filth"" and Rhysand\'s reply is physical violence plus a laconic“Don’t ever,” Rhys said, hands sliding into his pockets, “speak tomy matelike that again.”Again, everything, even on the level of language, revolves around a man and the girl\'s relationship to said man. I fail to see the women\'s empowerment in this.•I\'ve never seensuch a cheesy ending. It feltlike I had just swallowed a monumental bucket of melted sugarand I couldn\'t even breathe because the very air got stuck to the sticky back of my throat. Basically it made me finally understand that Maas\'s main interest was to make sure none of her precious babies got so much as a scratch.➽ I was trying to find a way to be tactful and diplomatic about this, but there is none. The first book was nice and very entertaining, the second was still entertaining but way less nice,the third is ignoble. Bottom line:this series is crap.Don\'t read it(and if you know me and my reviews, you know Ineveronce recommendednotto read a book, nor do I think I shall ever do it again, because the fact that I don\'t like something doesn\'t mean that nobody would or should. Besides, I don\'t really believe in second-hand opinions. So the fact that I think this book will actively damage your brains and that I\'m warning you off it should really speak volumes in itself). There are far more worthy books out there waiting for you.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '3.75 stars""Rhys stepped off the stairs and took my hand.Night Triumphant—and the Stars Eternal.If he was the sweet, terrifying darkness, I was the glittering light that only his shadows could make clear.""It\'s the worst feeling in the world when finales don\'t match up to their predecessors.I likedA Court of Thorns and Roses, IlovedA Court of Mist and Fury, I am frankly disappointed byA Court of Wings and Ruin.First, the writing.It\'s in desperate need of another round of editing. It\'s unpolished, full of unnecessary repetition and lazy placeholder sentences.Maascanwrite. She\'s proved it over and over again, which makes ACOWAR seem almost criminal. I think the strain of writing two novels a year finally caught up with her. ACOTAR AND ACOMAF don\'t really count because they were written long beforeThrone of Glasswas published. All she had to do was clean up. But ACOWAR was written back-to-back withEmpire of Storms, which was a beefy number on its own.Fervent as I was for ACOWAR, I wouldn\'t have minded waiting another year if it meant getting quality content.Second is the ending.Rhys lives, Amren lives, everybody fucking lives.Where are the sacrifices? How it can possible that no one in this bloated main cast dies? (Don\'t you bloody dare point to Feyre\'s dad. He was barely a presence the entire series, and I remain firmly convinced Maas brought him back just to fill the death toll and shut up people like me.)I understand Rhys\'s resurrection—he\'s Feyre\'s mate and fan favorite and therefore too important to die—but Amren too? Her losing her godly power is not a sacrifice. She\'s still High Fae. Why not make her human? Why not have a human serve in the Night Court? Or why not have Cassian or someone else lose their wings? Quite a few reviewers (and me included) havementioned this already, but Maas undeniably has an obsession with inhumanly powerful characters.On the subject of Rhys, it would have been so, so cool for Feyre to be the sole ruler of the Night Court. The first High Lady in history. And it would have been a fitting end to her character arc. She was dependent on a man in the first book, was broken by the same man in the second, and then healed and made to see she could be powerful and independent by another man. In the third, she stands alone, back straight, strong and proud, without a man. Obviously I\'m oversimplifying things here, but you can\'t deny the pieces line up.Also, that deus ex machina army in the end. Oh, we\'re on the edge of losing! All is lost! BUT WAIT here\'s an army. And ANOTHER army!Another thing that bothered me is howunbelievably powerful Feyre is.There is feminism, which is an underlying theme for her character, and there is what-the-fuckery. Near the beginning of the book, she is able to take on two daemati (powerful fae) who have a thousand years of fighting experience over her. Later, after she accidentally ingests a drug that strips her of her powers, they still magically flare back to life to help her triumph over two seasoned High Fae fighters.Right, I think I\'ve bitched enough about the bad.Let\'s get to the good.I love the characters.The Inner Circle, Lucien, Nesta, Elain... they are a huge part why I rated ACOWAR as high as it is. Feyre and Rhys—in this book and this book only—aren\'t as interesting. Their story in terms of conflict was finished in ACOMAF and although I enjoy how Maas explores how normal couples argue and make up, I\'m not as invested in them as before. There are too many other stories begging to be told: Lucien\'s, Elain\'s, Nesta and Cassian\'s, Mor\'s, Tamlin\'s.Yes, Tamlin. This fandom is too hard on him—and too forgiving of Rhys. I will never forget what he did in ACOTAR. Yet because the story is filtered through Feyre\'s perspective, Rhys becomes a hero who makes mistakes and Tamlin becomes a monster who commits unforgivable sins. He genuinely thought the woman he loved had been abducted and was likely being tortured. I\'m not excusing his abusive behavior, but we have to remember he was suffering from PTSD too. He was trying to protect Feyre the best he could—just like Rhys by forcing Feyre to make that bargain with him way back in ACOTAR, fyi. Why does Rhys deserve dozens of free passes and not Tamlin?Hating the High Lord of Spring just because Feyre does is a disservice to the complexity of his character.I also like that Maas seems to bepulling away from the whole ""mates"" concept.Multiple characters within have strong romantic relationships without the mating bond, and those that do may not necessarily be right for each other.Much as I love the idea of Lucien and Elain, I get the feeling that she\'s setting them up for something different. Elain and Azriel, and Lucien and Vassa.The pacing is good, too.There aren\'t as many sex scenes as the previous book, which I was happy about, though not due to any misguided sense of propriety. I simply found myself bored reading about Rhys slamming his shaft up to the hilt or what not.Still lowkey mad the first thing Feyre did after coming back from the Spring Court is bang Rhys and not check on her traumatized sisters.While I liked them in ACOMAF, there are more important things going on here, like the war or the other courts.Final verdict? Bring on the spin-offs.My review of A Court of Thorns & RosesMy review of A Court of Mist & FuryMy review of A Court of Frost and StarlightMy review of A Court of Silver Flames'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'I wish so much that I could tell you I loved this book... but I just didn\'t.After thinkingA Court of Mist and Furywas such a huge improvement fromA Court of Thorns and Roses, I was really excited for this third installment. I even preordered it. But I really struggled to get into the book from the very start. Frompacing issuestoawkward sex scenesthat did nothing for me, it was one disappointment after another.I\'ve said this before but I reallydislike Maas\'s sex scenes. At her best, she writes them strangely with words like ""branding"" and ""claiming"", but here they were just plain icky. With all the talk of ""mates"", ""growling"" and ""purring"", and the climaxing from stroking one another\'s wings, I felt like I\'d walked in on two animals rutting in the mud. Ugh.And another thing-- Feyre and Rhysand are already mated and loved up to their eyeballs so there wasno sexual tension, no will they/won\'t they, which made the sex scenes so boring.What\'s strange about these sex scenes is how they manage to somehow be both graphic and coy at the same time. Maas never actually uses explicit words. If a young kid picked up this book, they might assume Rhysand and Feyre were dancing or playing an instrument.His touch turned different. Exploring. Broad strokes and feather-light ones, arches and swirls and direct, searing lines.And her vagina is usually described as ""there"" or ""where I want him"". Then, at the same time, these scenes are weirdly overwritten, with her orgasm (obviously not called that) leaving her “skin glowing like a newborn star in its wake”. It\'s just really not my thing.I was disappointed with the writing in general, to be honest. Maas seemed to write a lot more ""tell"" and a lot less ""show"" than usual. I was especially disappointed at the wasted opportunity for some underhanded manipulation in the first part. After how the last book ended, Feyre was kind of ""undercover"" at the start and in a position for lies and sneakiness. Except it was mostly her swanning around and quietly seething to herself about how much she hated Ianthe and how much of a douche Tamlin is.I thought this whole part was boring when it should have been extremely tense and exciting.But I think the worst thing was the overall pacing. It\'s a long book, but I can normally sprint through Maas\'s works in a day, yet here it wassuch a slog. Especially the first half. It\'s taken up with a lot of character conversations and strategizing for the upcoming war with Hybern. It lacked a pull, a sense of urgency, some kind of tension to make me need to know what happens next.I cannot believe they\'ve announced anotherfour booksfor this series. Why??? I can only hope they are some kind of spin-off series because, otherwise, either a) we will have to suffer through who the fuck knows how many more awkward, unsexy Feyre/Rhysand sex scenes, or b) Maas will destroy Rhys\'s character and hook Feyre up with yet another hot fae dude. I\'m not sure which is more likely.The later chapters of this book picked up in pacing, but I think it wastoo little, too late. This is a whopping 700-page monster and it obviously didn\'t need to be. I will say that I liked how things were left with Tamlin, but seeing as that part was only a few sentences long, it doesn\'t make up for everything else.I\'m thinking this is where I drop out of this series.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Just published my latestBookTube Video- so excited to share it!The Written ReviewAfter that ending only one quote can adequately sum up my feelings:Something thumped in front of me.

Thank you for letting us dream and travel across the stars if only for a short time.I have been a massive fan of the ACOTAR series since the first book so I was highly anticipating ACOWAR.I was afraid I wouldn’t like the third book as much as I loved the second one but hell, I was so wrong. I swear, I don't know how many nerve cells this book cost me.Not only is the book thrilling and well-written. But it added a lot more complexity than I'd expected. Both in the characters and the plot.The progression brings aboutso many new faces(Have five to Helion, my second favourite High Lord), each of them unique in their own way.When Feyre was in the Spring Court, she was so over-powered like she is a goodness and no one can stop her -I was getting some unwanted Aelin’s vibe here– butthe plot was pretty well-driven after that, allowing each character to have its share of glory in Hybern Battle. And thank god for incredible plot twists or else I would have died a thousand times.The other thing that I really enjoyed is the fact thatthe book was unpredictable. I got all emotional becausethe story has a way of being built up and simply torn down piece by piece by a certain event and you are like “What the hell just happened?” and then being rebuilt once again.I literally went mental in one of the last scene – YES, THIS SCENE –my parents were actually concerned because of my change of emotions. I cried during the emotional moments, I got stressed during the battle scenes, I laughed so hard in others, I blushed during the bold sexy scenes, but most of all,I had – and still have believe me - embarrassing fangirling moments over the characters.I have a lot of favourite scenes.Like a lot especially those where a potential couple interact –You should have seen me during NESSIAN SCENES, I was a FANGIRL MONSTER– butone scene particular brought me to tear and that was RHYS’s SPEECH BEFORE the FINAL BATTLE.Overall, it wasan EPIC BOOK closing an AMAZING trilogy with immensely ENTERTAINING STORYLINE, characters TO LOVE and a DETAILED fantasy WORLD.Very much worth your time.What are you waiting for?""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Yay!

I have always been more of a fan of Sarah J Mass fan, but more towards her Thrown of Glass series. I think this is her best book so far. This book just has everything. Great characters, great story, secrets, betrayal, redemptions, ACTION!!!! You name it, it is here. 700 pages and not a line wasted. Hell, I would have been happy with another 700 pages of this standard. The character are great, but there is such great character development that no one is one dimensional the character are conflicted and complex with their own strengths and issues. Every time I learned something about one of the characters, I wanted to know more. Every character had their moment to shine in this book, and every character in this book could very easily star in their own book. That is the depth of the character in this story. Espicallly Rhysand, and anyone in the Court of Dreams.Since the last book, Feyre has returned to the Spring Court to destroy it from within. This is not Feyre crushed by her truma, suffocated by overprotection, or the powerless girl in a world of monsters/guardians. This is the angry, powerful, deadly calculating woman. I like the fact that Rhysand is every bit her match. I am actually interested to see which of them is the more powerful. So far, with centuries of experience behind battle, tactics, and studies, he seems to be a step ahead, but time will tell. However even with all this going on War is coming to Prythian and with all the High Lords in agreement (with their history of grudges and betrayal this is next to impossible ), they are still way out numbered against the King of Hybern and the power of the Calderon. Once again, it falls to the Court of Dreams to lead the charge not only against their enemies but the very thinking of many Prythians as well.This is just an awesome book. I don't think you have to read the other book in the series to love this book, but I would definitely recommend reading the whole series, but I definitely read this one. The more I read, the more I wanted to read. It took me through every emotion, the anger of betrayal, the pride in overcoming adversity, to the election of victory.

Maas-ish in a way that did not surprise me but still made me terribly emotional. It wasn’t the ACOMAF-emotion, it wasn’t the EoS-emotion, it wasn’t the KoA-emotion, it wasn’t the HoEaB-emotion.This book has had its own emotion, I swear. It was tough, but somehow it was milder than the others previously named.Except for what happened on page 666.I cannot forgive that.I almost had both a heart attack and a stroke at the same time. And I am still not over it and I still feel like SJM pulling shit like this on me is exactly why I might need therapy.After the pure emotion of the previous book in the series,A Court of Wings and Ruinshows the final battle and all its raw and powerful emotions and actions. The dirty and the bad and the ugly – there are all of them there.This battle though is also freedom. No one is above scheming anymore. One must do everything they have in power to win because the cause is holy. There are sacrifices that must be made and plans that must be developed.This battle is also about unity and the book shows us how important this is. When there is a common goal at stake, then pride must be left outside when entering the war-tent. And true masters of war know that. Everyone must work together because victory is in the numbers.Aside from the compelling emotions that charge a book deeply powered by the promise of war, there is another facet of the plot.Thecharactersdiscover alter-egos, personalities that they did not know they had. Or they knew and they tried to reprimand them as hard as possible. Everyone has to overcome their own selves and that is a battle too.“It’s a rare person to face who they truly are and not run from it – not be broken by it.”Every character has their own secret that springs out with the tiniest occasion it gets to have. We see different angles of Cassian and Azriel, of Mor and Amren, of Nesta and Elain, of Tamlin and Lucien. They all fight two battles – of freedom and of self.Rhys and Feyre get to discover and unravel themselves too, but where Feyre finds her vengeful self, her strong and determined essence of a ruler, Rhysand shows us his vulnerable, soft side. The side that determined him to sacrifice himself to keep the ones he loved free.In this book, Rhysand is his ultimate selfless self. And honestly, nothing in this world would make me not love this hell of male.Sarah hit the jackpot with this gem, I’m telling you.If I had to get through absolutely every single emotion this book gave me then I’ll need something stronger than infused water to keep me going, a big cone of chocolate ice cream and probably a re-read of the whole ACOTAR series just to be sure I get everything right.I love how cunning and ruthless does SJM get when writing her books and even though sometimes there is no need for something like this, ACOWAR had to benefit from that. How else could such a mesmerising story end but in tears of frustration and raw feelings, I’m asking you?I honestly fell so hard for this series it became one of the things I think I’ll love in my life forever and ever. Glad I could read it and right now, writing this sorry of a review, I am considering so hard re-reading all of the books because damn, this helps my mental health in so many weird ways I can’t even seem to understand it myself.If you haven’t read the beauty of the ACOTAR series, please just go for it.

It also contains unmarked spoilers because it is almost three thousand words long and I don\'t have time to go through and mark every single spoiler.ACOWAR had the unfortunate luck of having to proceed the epicness that was A Court of Mist and Fury. It’s like being given $1,000,000, spending it all, then being given only a $100,000. Both amounts of money are nice to have, but obviously the million is the better option. Or like watching Beyonce perform live in concert, then having to watch a youtube video of Beyonce. Both are nice, great options, but there is always going to be the preferable one. I actually feel sorry for ACOWAR. It didn’t deserve to be a follow-up toA Court of Mist and Fury, but it really didn’t have an option. ACOWAR is better than ,A Court of Thorns and Rosesbut if you were to look up the definition of “prefection” in the dictionary, there will be a picture of the ACOMAF cover.Let me just get some of my thoughts & feels written down real quick. Beware, some might be spoilery. Please proceed with caution.A COURT OF THOUGHTS & FEELS1. Rhys is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him2. Feyre is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her3. Mor is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her4. Lucien is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him5. Amren is actually the best fictional character ever and I love her6. Azriel is actually the best fictional character even and I love him7. Cassian is actually the best fictional character ever and I love him8. Tamlin is actually the worst fictional character ever and I hate him9. I hate him so much10. Seriously11. Who okay’d Tamlin as a character?12. They should be fired13. Ianthe sucks too14.I’m glad that bitch got destoryed by the weaver15. We could have done without the sex scenes though.16. Remember when they were in the library? And all they wanted to do was have sex and not read. Talk about unrealistic.17. Rhys is the most dramatic character in YA…...pass it on18. The beginning, when Feyre was at the Spring Court, was actually my favorite part of the entire book? I loved it.19. I was just like yaaas Feyre girl you destroy those losers20. Also when Feyre and Rhys were reunited that was cool21. I wanted that scene to be longer though with a lot less sex22.Also the Suriel’s death was not okay’d by me and Sarah will be hearing from my lawyers23. Also who approved the term “vulgar gesture???” They should be fired too.24. Also if I ever hear the word ""mate"" again I\'m gonna spontaneous combust25. Cassian + Feyre = A friendship you will never have26. Mor is gay and all is okay27.Also no one in the night squad died which is really unrealistic to me? Also kinda disappointing. I was preparing myself for a death that never came, which took time away from me preparing my funeral.28. Also Amren is the best thing to come out of this book29. If the sequels aren’t about her I’m sueing.30. Also does anyone know why we were fighting this war? I don\'t remember.31. And also does anyone remember how the high lord powers work and why they all happen to be the most powerful people their courts but they get their position through genetics? Because if I haven\'t learned anything from YA literature, at least I\'ve learned that there will always be a chosen one who\'s more powerful than any ruler. So why hasn\'t that happened?CHARACTERS! cHARACTERSFeyre.Feyre is the best? She has evolved so much since the first book. And she\'s so loyal to those she loves. But if she hates you, you are dead. There is no way to save you.Rhys.I don\'t know if you knew this, but in certain countries it\'s agaisnt the law to hate Rhys. He\'s the best.Tamlin.Remember that time when you used to like Tamlin? Hahahaha he\'s an asshole.Mor.She\'s gay! Which is also the only diversity we got in this book.But she\'s the best.Amren.I want to be her when I grow up. She\'s the best.Lucien.I am just so glad that Lucien found God in this book.Cassian.I just love Cassian? I just want him to wrap me up in his wings. He\'s the best.Azriel.I would leave my boyfriend Kaz for Azriel. He\'s the best.SUMMARY AND COMMENTARYI’m going to do something I never done before in a review. There are so many scenes that I just want to talk about, that I’m gonna summarize a lot of this book so I can talk about them. This entire thing is spoilery so please don\'t read unless you\'ve read the book.So we start off athellthe Spring Court and Tamlin is being is douchebag self like always. He’s just hanging around, doing his meninist things. Not realizing that Miss High Lady of the Night Court over there is slowly taking down his court.A nightmare, I’d told Tamlin.Iwas the nightmare.I was kinda hoping for more telepathic interactions? I wanted Feyre to say something like, “Oh Rhys was just terrible to me.” and Rhys to just pop up and be like, “Terribly good in bed.” or something like that. But that never happened. SJM really threw away her shot.Hamilton would be disappointed.I’m going to be honest here. I didn’t really understand how Feyre took down the Spring Court? Like I know she did it by gaining the people’s trust. But I didn’t understand that sunlight scene or all the uneventful trips to the wall. Also Ianthe didn’t die in the first part which was disappointing. BUT IANTHE DOES GET HER HAND SMASHED INTO LITTLE PIECES BY FEYRE WHICH IS SO FREAKING BRUTAL I screamed the entire time like wow I don’t like the bitch either but did she really deserve to have her hand continuously smashed? I am a good person who has morals and part of me is still like “yeah she deserved that”Anyways Feyre is eventually like #byelosers @ the Spring Court and leaves. She takes Lucien with her which is really cool because Lucien deserved better than those assholes. So Lucien and Feyre flee the Spring Court, which at this point is burning.In fact I have an actual, never before seen picture of the spring court taken shortly after Feyre leftSome stuff happens and there\'s fighting because it’s a high fantasy novel and not having any fighting would probably make it a contemporary or something. But anyhow, Cassian eventually comes and helps Feyre and Lucien with the fighting. And the Cassian/Feyre reunion is the best reunion in this book? Like what Feyre/Rhys reunion?I met those laughing, fierce hazel eyes.Cassian’s smile softened. “Hello, Feyre.""My throat tightened to the point of pain, and I threw my arms around his neck, embracing him tightly.“I missed you, too,” Cassian murmured, squeezing me.Honestly, that scene was the absolute best? Like after that, the Feysand reunion was so underwhelming. It happened just a few pages later but it wasn’t cute dialogue and hugs and ***friendship*** Their meetup was crying on the floor then having unnecessary explicit sex.SJM is great and all, but her sex scenes are the worst. I understand that sex is a thing that exist and Feysand participates in it, but I just don’t care about the details. I would rather have more Amren dialogue.So at one point during all this reunion sex, Feyre tells Rhys that he likes a dramatic entrance which has just won an oscar for “understatement of the year”. Because obviously, Rhys did not crash Feyre’s wedding in ACOMAFThe next part of the book is just like plotting and stuff. It’s kind of boring. I honestly almost fell asleep during the next two hundred pages? I mean I didn’t though because this is a SJM book but I could have. There was no action. No suspense. At least I had Amren and her I-don’t-give-a-shit attitude to keep me awake.There is the library scene which is the worst scene in the entire book. So Feyre and Rhys are in this gigantic ass library surrounded by books which is like life goals right? If you don’t want to be surrounded by books then gtfo of my review. But anyways, instead of appreciating the luxuries they have in their life, Feyre and Rhys spend the entire time flirting with each other? This annoyed me so much. It was the most unrealistic scene in this entire series. I don’t care if my High Lord mate was there with me. If I was in a library surrounded by books, then he doesn’t freaking exist in that moment.Also there is a giant monster thing that lives in the basement of this library that everyone is afraid of? #goals“If you hadn’t stolen my bride away in the night, Rhysand, I would not have been forced to take such drastic measures to get her back.”I said quietly, “The sun was shining when I left you.”So Rhys and Feyre and the rest of the squad decided to throw a party. By party I mean, they decided to get all the incredibly powerful, opinionated fae in one place and try to come to an agreement. This is such a smart idea. Just wow. They also invite Tamlin to be nice and then they act surprised when he shows up??? Like you guys sent him an invite to your birthday party??? It would be rude of him not to come???? Why would he turn down free cake like that?!?!?!Tarquin took him in. Then me. And the others. “I rescind the blood rubies. Let there be no debts between us.”“Don’t expect Amren to return hers,” Cassian muttered. “She’s grown attached to it.”So the greatest thing ever happened during this meeting? And I’m not talking about when Feyre destroyed Tamlin when he was being a prick. No, I’m talking about how Amren isn’t returning her ruby that marks her for death? She’s so iconic. I want to be Amren when I grow up.Then, while all these high lords were in the same place and wasting time fighting with each other,donald trumpthe King ofHybitchHyburn brings down the wall that they were all tryingnot sodesperately to protect. And again, they were all surprised.Like are you fUCKing kidding me? How did you not see this coming???? You are standing around, doing pratically nothing. Wasting all the time in the world. AND YO UARE SUPRISED THAT HYBITCH IS ACTUALLY GOING THROUGH WITH HIS PLANS. YOU KNOW HE WAS TRYING TO BRING THAT WALL DOWN. he WAS GONNA DO IT AND YOUR BIRTHDAY PARTY WAS THE PERFECT OPPURTUNITY. Honestly, I am surprised he didn’t succeed earlier than this?So noW that the wall has been destroyed and is never coming back, all these high lords realized that if they are going to win this war, they are gonna all get off their asses to do something.Also what even are we fighting for? All I know about this war is that the King of Hyburn is bad and the Night Court Squad is good. How did this war even start? What did Amarantha have to do with anything? Who even is Myriam person and what does she have to do with anything? I know it was probably explained in ACOMAF but that was a year ago and I was too busy placing my attention on Rhys to pay any attention. So at this point I’m 469 pages into the last book of this trilogy and I don’t even know what we are fighting for? I’m emotionally invested in a war I know nothing about. Is this what politics are like?Anyways, the squad and their newly found high lord allies go to take down Hybitch.So then Feyre has this brilliant idea to go find out good friend the Suriel. I forgot the Suriel even existed tbh. He’s so creepy that I am sure my brain purposely block him out from my ACOTAR memories. So we go find Mr. Suriel and he is near the Weaver’s cottage.I also blocked the weaver out from my memories so, if you are like me, this is when you bust open your ACOTAR coloring book, flip to the picture of the Weaver, and then pretend to remember.So the Suriel is kinda helpful but unhelpful as always. But Feyre still cares about him becasue why would’t you care about the creepy monster that doesn’t even have a proper name and you\'ve only met like three times? So Suriel, that unhelpful yoda, is in the middle of giving Feyre vague advice when THAT BITCH IANTHE SHOWS UP AND JUST SHOOTS HIM WITH AN ARROW FOR NO GOOD REASON. Obviously having a crushed hand hasn’t affected her aim any.Someone should just kill that bitch already. Which is exactly what Feyre does. And she isn’t even easy on her. She takes Ianthe into the Weaver’s cottage and the weaver like eats her. Gross. I would have atleast chosen a less graphic demise. And something that kills her a lot longer.How fortunate are we that we caught the impossible-to-catch Suriel for the third time right near the cottage of a monster thing that likes to eat bitches? We are soooo fortunate.“Feyre Archeron,” the Suriel said again, gazing at the leafy canopy, the sky peeking through it. A painful inhale. “A request.”I leaned close. “Anything.”Another rattling breath. “Leave this world...a better place than how you found it.”So after murdering Ianthe, Feyre goes back to the dying Suriel and I haveThe Hunger Gamesflashbacks to Rue’s death scene. I was kind of expecting Feyre to gather flowers to place around the Suriel. And obviously, even though we are in a world surrounded by magic, there is no way to save the Suriel. He dies. I’m devastated. You are devastated. I still vaguely remember the Suriel from the past two books.And if I’m honest, this all could have been avoided if Feyre wasn’t so dramatic and just asked the Suriel to coffee or something.Oh also, I just happened to have stumbled upon this picture of Feyre that was taken one time after someone was shocked she caught the SurielMore stuff I don’t care about happens blah blah blah and then Feyre’s sister, Elain, is somehow kidnapped by the cauldron.Also making a cauldron the most powerful object in all the universe is the stupidest thing I’ve ever read.How did the Cauldron kidnap Elain? I don’t know it is never really explained how that inanimate object does anything. Remember, I still don’t know why the crap we are at war here. Anyways, Feyre gets really upset so she goes undercover as Ianthe and infiltrates the Hyburn army and saves Elain. Feyre goes through maybe one obstacle along the way and then returns to her mate Rhys.Also, if you are a person who participates in drinking games, then here’s a fun one for you while you read the book. Every time the word “mate” is said you drink. And get drunk during the first chapter. You\'ll be in the hospital by the third chapter. So actually don’t play that drinking game.And was I the only person who felt this entire thing was so unneeded? This is a 700 page book and we are nearing the end and now we are going on missions that run a little too smoothly? Like I know Azriel gets hurt but he’ll heal perfectly fine because we live in a world of healing magic that works on bat wings but not bitch’s hands.More fighting. There is a lot of fighting that happens. It’s like they are at war or something.Oh remember Feyre’s father? Yeah, I don’t either. But he comes back. I didn’t know he was gone but he came back with ships named after his daughters and Odette fromSwan Lakebut instead of a Swan, she’s a firebird which might just be a stupid name for a phoenix, oh and he name isn’t Odette. Anyways, her father finds this queen they just happened to be looking for even though there’s no way he could have possibly known that because he has been missing for 37297843 years. So obviously, because of this all his past sins are forgiven instantly. Then her father eventually dies because ofTrumpHybitch and we are suppose to be sad about it but I’m still standing here likeThen, on page 666, because Sarah is in fact the devil, the unthinkable happens. MY BABY RHYS WHO IS SUPPOSE TO BE PROTECTED AT ALL TIMES DIES. YES DIES. AND AT THIS POINT I’M CRYING IN THE CORNER AND WANTING TO THROW THE BOOOK INTO A VOLCANOAnd I’m just like, “If he ficking stays dead then at least all 700 pages of this book will make great kindling to warm my now cold heart”But then I remember ACOTAR and how Feyre here died and then was brought back to life so I start looking at the other high lords who happen to be near us at this moment and I’m just “Hey do a girl a favor here AND BRING BACK MY BOYFRIEND.”But then I also remember there’s a certain asshole who is also a high lord who has to help and I Start FREAKING out but then he comes through and he’s just like “Be happy, Feyre,” and SAVES RHY’S LIFEYou still an asshole Tam, but maybe just a little bit less.ANd I’m just crying in the corner even harder than before.Then somehow they defeat the King of Hybitch and Feyre and Rhys live happily ever after. Both are alive. The #NightSquad is still alive. Beause that is super realistic.Looks like the only person who is dead here is me. Oh well.CONCLUSIONSo while ACOMAF is still the best, this is still a great novel and I loved it? Being with all my children again is all I have ever asked for in life and I \'m just glad that they all ended up happy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.8/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”Let me talk to you about this book. This bookKILLED ME. This bookDESTROYED ME. This bookANNIHILATED ME. This bookOBLITERATED ME. This bookELIMINATED ME. This bookWIPED ME OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH. This bookEXTERMINATED ME. This bookERADICATED ME. I will never recover. How can I function after this fucking book? I was supposed to read it slowly becauseA Court of Frost and Starlightwill arrive here after a week and I have had serious issues waiting for those books in the past, but I couldn\'t stop. The last 300 pages were marvelous, they gripped me by the balls and took me with them on this amazing journey. I was reading till6amyesterday. No regrets. The feels are always heightened this ungodly time of day. And I\'m so happy I read this book at that time. But let\'s start from the very beginning.Looming war threatens all Feyre holds dear in the third volume of the #1 New York Times bestselling A Court of Thorns and Roses series.Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin\'s manoeuvrings and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But to do so she must play a deadly game of deceit – and one slip may spell doom not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.As war bears down upon them all, Feyre must decide who to trust amongst the dazzling and lethal High Lords – and hunt for allies in unexpected places.This book started off strong enough. I was extremely excited about Feyre infiltrating Tamlin\'s Court and taking him down. She would be such a badass. I expected this part of the book to be bigger, to be honest. About 250 pages, to be exact. I really enjoyed the scheming, the planning, the cleverness of Feyre, how she turned everyone against one another so brilliantly. I hated Tamlin and Ianthe more in this part of the book, obviously. They were both manipulative, controlling and toxic. They truly deserved each other. Lucien gained some respect from me in this part of the book. I was really disappointed in him inA Court of Mist and Fury.Afterwards, the pace of the book gets a bit slower than I would have wanted. I expected it to happen, because the ""format"" of these books is always the same, for me at least. A very powerful beginning, then the pace lags a little bit and in the end the trueBAM! But it was different for me in this book. I didn\'t feel the same excitement its predecessor gave me (till page 400). And I understand why. The previous book opened up a whole entire different world to me. From the Spring Court and everything we thought we knew was right, everything changed. And we start off getting to know everything in the Night Court, and it was all exhilarating. As much and even more as it was getting to know the entire world of everything in the first book. Getting to know Rhysand and his true incentives, the inner circle, the world, seeing the romance bloom between Rhysand and Feyre. In this book, everything is settled. We know everyone, the world, the romance is stable. There aren\'t as many new things happening, except when we get to page 400. Till this page, I would have given this book 4 stars, which is low for this series for me, because I LIVE FOR IT.I\'m going to talk a bit about the first 400 pages, before my favorite part of the book starts. After Feyre arrived in the Night Court with Lucien, everything took a certain pace. We got to feel Velaris again, the inner circle, Rhysand, the conflict, the problems. A gargantuan War is coming, and they had to deal with it. Gather allies, forge a plan, make actions, bargains. This entire chunk of the book was about the war and how they would end it. And I truly enjoyed that but it didn\'t keep me on my toes, you know? Till page 400.PAGE 400. THAT\'S WHERE THE REAL SHIT STARTS. And then we got to page 400. When the meeting starts. This is the part I couldn\'t leave the book down. The part where if anyone commanded me to leave the book down, I would have killed them. Like fucking Feyre would. This meeting was so enthralling. The tension was keeping me enraptured the entire time. I\'m content that we got to know the other High Lords of Prythian, we got a better understand of the world and its people. They were all truly incredible characters (except Beron), especially Helion. I loved his humor, his swag and that he\'s bisexual. I noticed something very important in this book. There was more representation. Not enough but more. We got to see black characters, bisexual characters, gay characters, lesbian characters (MOR I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, I\'M SO PROUD OF YOU GIRL). This series isn\'t known for its diversity, but it was nice to see some more examples popping up. It was refreshing.But anyway, let\'s continue with the meeting. I was so proud of all my Night Court babies, how they handled it. Each question a challenge that was met brilliantly.IF I COULD I WOULD STAND UP AND APPLAUD AZRIEL FOR ATTACKING ERIS. FUCKING ERIS.And also my Queen Feyre, who showed her true powers without fear of the High Lords. Of so many High Lords, who could easily kill her. And then Tamlin enters the Dawn Court room. I thought there was a limit to how much I hated him, but he surpassed that. His crude, distasteful and inappropriate comments were so unnecessary. Dude, we know how fucking butthurt you are that your girlfriend left you for a better man than you, but we\'re here to discuss how to prevent the War, your comments are fucking irrelevant. Be a better man for once and show some restraint. Now wonder even Lucien left you. Lucien. Oh man. Helion is Lucien\'s father. I was so fucking astonished. This book bestowed many plot twists for us, and this was one that gripped me tightly. I don\'t even know the reason, I just really like Lucien all of a sudden. More than I liked him in the first book. And I genuinely appreciated how he trusted Feyre, and how he acclimated himself to the Night Court. How he saw good in Rhysand and his people, after all the propaganda of the latest hundreds of years. How he wanted to be useful and help do something significant for the War.I WANT TO DISCUSS HOW FEYRE IS SUCH A SHIPPER, IT HURTS. Feyre is like us. She ships her friends with each other and tries to make the ship happen. I\'m so proud of her. I\'m so proud that she actively participates in her friend\'s happiness. She ships everything I ship, and I couldn\'t not notice it, it\'s so obvious. I want her to succeed. I want her to find the best fucking girlfriend for Mor, cause my girl deserves happiness. They all deserve it, but her more, in the relationship factor. I\'m very sorrowful that in this world, a lesbian woman can\'t thrive. It mirrors our own world, to be exact. Some people have the resources and the family behind to support them, and some people just, don\'t. Mor has been so unlucky in the romance department, with her cruel family stopping everything that she does. I want her to come out, and I want Feyre to be beside her and support her.I WANT TO TALK ABOUT NESTA AND CASSIAN. NESTA AND CASSIAN. The ship I was rooting for since the previous book. The ship that is killing my heart slowly and painfully.THEY HAVE TO BE MATES. PLEASE TELL ME THEY\'RE MATES. And even if they\'re not, their dynamic is so strong. Their scenes so utterly powerful, even them staring at each other had me dying in my seat. I want them to thrive. They are my favorite couple, after Rhysand and Feyre, and I want them to prosper. There was such a gradual progress with them. Sarah handled this couple\'s dynamic amazingly. How we started seeing, little by little, how Nesta started caring more about Cassian. How gentle he was with her, with her feelings. He didn\'t push her, he didn\'t drive her to the edge. I want more of them, I want them to take over the world. Nesta is such a favorite character of mine. Strong, unyielding, snarky, flawed, raw, true. She is perfectly flawed, the way I like my characters to be. This book series doesn\'t favor flawed characters. Most of them are impeccable, outside and inside. But Nesta isn\'t. She still shows her humanity and I love her for it.We talked about Nesta... now we have to talk about Elain. Useless, needless Elain. I didn\'t like her in this book. I loathed her moping around, her extremely extravagant sensitivity, her outmost obsolescence. I couldn\'t stand everyone defending and protecting her, all the fucking time. Oh poor little Elain, how bad must it be for you to be immortal, young and beautiful forever, aw I feel so sorry for you. She didsomethingin the end by stabbing The Hybern King, but not something miraculous. Nesta integrated the action. I just didn\'t enjoy her character in this book, she was utterly annoying to me.This War man... this War. It was the most tit gripping thing I have read in a very long time. The adrenaline was high up in heaven. It was jaw dropping, breathtaking, awe-inspiring. When the hope was lost, there would be hope, and when there was hope, it would be taken harshly out of our grip. There was so much shit happening, so many characters appearing, to help, to condemn. Strategies being thrown our the window, plans succeeding, failing, bargains breaking. There was just.. so much happening. I couldn\'t keep track of everything. The action was astounding, the plot twists out of this world, the thrill spectacular. I devoured these chapters in a heartbeat. I wasn\'t even looking at the pages or chapters, or even time, I was just reading. This book was a true and amazing ending to an incredible series. I\'m so happy I picked these books up. This series made me love fantasy again. I have stopped being a fan of fantasy for many many years, and these books reintroduced me to its virtues.I WANT TO READ MORE FANTASY BECAUSE OF THESE BOOKS YEAH.RHYS\'S DEATH GUYS. It happened in page666, how convenient. I didn\'t feel a heartbeat for a minute. I know he would survive because he\'s in the next book, but you know how it is. I was utterly heartbroken by Feyre\'s reaction. She made me feel what she was feeling. I cried. Literally. And hear me out a bit. This is a huge deal for me. I never cry with books. The only books I have ever cried about are theHarry Potterseries and theOutlanderseries. Which are my all time favorite books of all the fucking universe. When I started crying, I was so surprised at myself. I was so happy I did. Because Rhys has become one of my all time favorite characters, and seeing his demise broke me. Like Feyre\'s heart was broken. And then Tamlin gives his last speck of light and saves him. Let\'s talk about him and his redemption arc.You have seen my feelings about him in the fist part of this review. In the end, they shifted, just a bit. I truly appreciated how he helped Feyre, how he saved her. And how he saved Rhysand\'s life. I don\'t like him, but I value how he got over his grudge, and actually helped everyone, for the good of Prythian. I forgive you, Tamlin, you\'re still a piece of shit of a character with many unsolved issues, but as Feyre said“I hope you find happiness, too.\'""And I did. Not just for what he\'d done for Rhys, but...Even for an immortal, there was not enough *time* in life to waste it on hatred. On feeling it and putting it into the world.So I wished him well -- I truly did, and hoped that one day...One day, perhaps he would face those insidious fears, that destructive rage rotting away inside him.”You get a pass, bitch. I\'m curious of what will happen to his relationship with Lucien. It will be interesting.I have written 12000 words for this review. And 8000 are left. I will surpass Goodread\'s character limit. Lmao. I had so much to say about this book, the ending of a marvelous series. I couldn\'t help myself and I\'m very sorry for this chaos of a review. My feels are still raw and unedited. And if you\'re reading this right now, you\'re a true hero for going through all of this shittone. And I love you for it.To sum it all up, this book was a truly magnificent journey and an incredible ending to a wonderful series. I\'m literally speechless, and I will think about this book a lot. For a very long time. Nothing else more I can say, this review explains it all. I will crawl now to my bed and die peacefully of the feels. And till the next one... K BYE!7500 characters left out of 20000.LMFAO.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 ✧･ﾟ: *""I would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years.""This was the easiest 5 stars of my life, and for sure my favourite book in the series. I wish I could attach the video of me hysterically crying. I felt so much for this story, world and characters. So many things like tugged my heart strings, whilst being whimsical at the same time. I laughed and cried - this was just sooooo good. Getting into fantasy is really hard sometimes but this made it so easy. ⋆˙⟡♡╰┈➤PlotI think this book is a lot more plot focused than ACOMAF. They\'re dealing with strained political bonds with a devastating war on the horizon. It was so cool to see the other courts and all their personalities, how they all had their own stories that tie in with our main characters. As a certified romance hater, this was much more my style. There is stilla lotof romance to swoon for, between multiple characters and it was just *chef\'s kiss*.I will not stop talking about found family - these moments were responsible for me crying my eyes out.╰┈➤CharactersPersonally,Feyrewas a lot more likeable in this book. Less whining, more protective sister, protective family member. She\'s still not perfect and buts her nose into situations which I feel like she shouldn\'t, but it didn\'t make me dislike her, it\'s just a flaw. She has some very epic and real adventurous moments in this, and her anointment asHigh Lady of the Night Courtonly made me like her more.Rhysand, what a sweetheart. I love him to bits, he\'s soft on the inside but a bit of a powerful arrogant cheeky guy on the outside. He\'s sooooo sweet to Feyre and as someone who loveswords of affirmationI found him so loveable. He loves his family so deeply and that is represented further in this book. I loveCassianmore though. He\'s like a man man, also my style, but has a very soft spot for a girl. So adorable.BothNestaandElainmade me fall in love with them. They\'re so different, and they developed differently during this story, but the outcome was still the same. Nesta was starting to get on my nerves at one point because she\'s a bitice coldbut it grows on you, as it grows on a particular Illyrian warrior. I love the fact that they both have a special power that contributes to their overall adventure/mission. I\'m so excited to see them more in the next book. 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒╰┈➤World/SettingListen - this world was beautifully painted. The characters in this were painted so vividly, I could imagine each of them and they were all beautiful. As we see a lot more of the different courts, we see how different they are, both in attitude and visual representation, which was so well done. I could see Autumn court, Summer court, Winter court, Day & Dawn, and it\'s just so cool. I can\'t decide which one I would like to live in more, but I\'m leaning towards Winter.╰┈➤PacingSomething was always happening, there was always something to be interested in, laugh at, or cry at. There were some really tense moments at the ends of chapters that kept me hooked and this is a looooong book (703 pages).

Maas, and it\'s wild. The book starts with Feyre spying on the Spring Court for Rhys, pretending to be Tamlin\'s faithful wife again so she can undermine his Court from the inside.I absolutely adored the first part of the book. I love how clever Feyre was, setting up the destruction of the Spring Court while no one knew what she was planning. The way she tricked Tamlin was gold.After she returns to the Night Court, war breaks out between Hybern and Prythian. She goes on a quest to find the Cauldron, an ancient source of magic that might just stop the war. But not all of the Courts are willing to help her, and she will have to call on other magical creatures and forces to aid her in her search.I didn\'t like this part of the book as much. It felt very aimless to me, and drawn out for so long that the plot points lost all meaning. I wasn\'t bored, exactly, but the plot just feltwrongto me, as if something were missing. It was pretty straightforward in the beginning—find the Cauldron, destroy Hybern—but then a bunch of subplots were introduced. Feyre had to make deals with spirits and gods, she had to avoid Hybern—it was just... a lot, and yet too little at the same time. What do I mean by ""too little?"" Well...The pacing was dreadful. That doesn\'t mean I was bored.The plot built up far too quickly. Unlike inThrone of Glass,where the plot built gradually and climaxed in KoA, the plot here came out of nowhere. The villain, the King of Hybern, was so one-dimensional and uninteresting. His motives didn\'t make sense, the little history that was thrown in was so random and didn\'t help make him a better character at all, and his death was so unsatisfying. The character who killed him... well, I\'m not going to spoil it, but I don\'t think they were the right character to do the job. See the spoilery section for more on that.This series would have been better as just a regular romance, without all this...plot.I only really cared about the Inner Circle anyway. If it were just a faerie romance with great side characters and a found family, I would. Not. Care. That\'s all I want. Adding a whole epic plotline to the story just drags it down. I much preferred the more introspective ACOMAF.I really, really loved Feyre in ACOMAF, and now? Not so much. She has too many powers. She can do everything the High Lords can and more. I love how she\'s the first High Lady, but honestly, she has every power and it gets annoying when she can do basically anything.However, there are still times when I like Feyre more than Aelin. She\'s more mild and less overbearing, and I like that in a protagonist. She\'s persistent when she needs to be, and determined to learn. She understands the meaning of responsibility.Rhys before the mating bond is superior to Rhys after the mating bond. For one, he was less protective in the beginning of ACOMAF versus ACOWAR. I\'m tired of overprotective, aggressive male characters. I miss the Rhysand of ACOMAF, the one with a sharp sense of humor and patient respect for Feyre. He still has some of the traits he exhibited earlier, but they\'re dimmed in the face of his overpoweringmaleness that can sometimes turn into toxic masculinity. Thank you, next.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS AHEAD, PROCEED WITH CAUTION🚨🚨🚨Elain killed the King of Hybern and I am angry.She\'s incapable of doing anything useful and everyone, including the other characters, consistently forgets she exists. How am I supposed to believe she sneaked up behind the big baddie and stabbed him? How is she the hero here? Okay, maybe this is her big moment, when she overcomes her fear and does something awesome, but... where\'s the buildup?I have a theory that NoBrain Elain is actually whip-smart and pretends to be meek and helpless just to manipulate everyone around her. And I have evidence.1. One of Elain\'s only lines of dialogue is, ""I hope they all burn in hell."" And everyone is shocked because she likes gardens and flowers and she hardly ever talks so they all think she\'s weak. But what if this is just Elain\'s true side showing through?2. She holds all of the characters in the palm of her hand. Nesta is obsessed with protecting her. Azriel is in love with her. Feyre will do anything to save her when she gets captured, and so Rhys likes her too just because Feyre does. They risked all of their lives just to sneak into Hybern\'s camp and save her, despite the fact that she has done nothing useful this entire book. What if she\'s manipulating them all, using them for her own gain?That\'s my wild theory. Have fun with it.At the end of the book, Amren sacrifices herself to destroy Hybern. This had the potential to be a really powerful, touching moment. But no. She got brought back from the dead because no one EVER dies in fantasy books. And this makes me mad. Her sacrifice lost all of its pain because there were literally no consequences.🚨🚨🚨SPOILERS HAVE ENDED🚨🚨🚨NoBrain ElainWritten by SofiaNoBrain Elain puts me in painHer stupid shenanigans make me mad againShe\'s a pointless character who does nothingBut add to my unending sufferingShe never talks, but everyone loves herMaybe it\'s trauma, but I still sufferShe gets into trouble and everyone criesI just smile and hope she diesShe belongs with Tamlin, that much is trueIf she ends with Azriel, I will sueNesta may be angering, but at least she\'s not thisI would banish Elain from this earth with my last wishElain, ElainNoBrain ElainNobody cares about your painThis may sound harsh, but rest assuredThe whole book community thinks you\'re absurd3.5 starsACOTAR reviewACOMAF reviewcredit'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'You know you\'re a dedicated fan when you mark an untitled book set to release in 2017 as a ""want to read"".

Maaswiped that sneer off my face and proved me wrong. Again.A Court of Wings and Ruinis a work of art that will make you run out of proper adjectives to describe all the pandemonium, magic and apocalypse it entails. The kind that will pull at your heartstrings right from the get-go and hold you with its sharp claws, imploring you to devour it.Intense action, delicious romance, backstabbing, ferociously deadly creatures, raw brutality, lies and disguise are all ornately woven into a tale that will cocoon you into the Fae world and soothe you, leaving you anchored by nothing but a tempest in your lungs.There was darkness and light, storm and calm, despair but also hope. You will see battles mired with savagery and viciousness, harsh and regrettable decisions and nerve-wracking adventures in a world where humans are perceived as weak and easily destroyable.Sarah J. Maas's world building is so exquisite that I felt detached from my own body, incapable of focusing on anything else happening around me, only flipping the pages with an acute yearning of what's about to happen. She delivers plenty of magic and mayhem, with a knack for perfect pacing of the story and character reflection.CharactersThe Inner Circle, my favourite squad ❤I love their devotion to each other. Their ability to be kind in spite of harsh circumstances, their ability to love despite enduring a millenia of cruelty. They're all so full of light, it makes we want to smile and simultaneously tear up at their unconditional loyalty. I was so attached to them, like I was bound to them by an invisible, irrevocable tether. When they struggled, I struggled. When they were hurt, I was hurt. I could feel their rage, loyalty and honour coursing through my veins, like a shrieking void.High LordsI don't think I would have enjoyed this book at all if not for them. I'm glad thatSarah J. Maasshowed them in a new light, something readers haven't seen in the previous books.As amusing as their banter was, I also feel deeply moved by their actions, their unwavering faith in one another during the battle despite their iffy past.Be itHelion,the Spell Cleaver;Thesan,the healer;Tarquin,the sympathetic and thoughtful leader;Kallias,the snow/ice manipulator andBeron,..... Never mind, I didn't really like him; I loved them with every echoing heartbeat. (Beron being the exception)\u200eOh andTamlin. I apologise if I've been harsh to him after readingA Court of Mist and Fury, but I have a new found respect for him. Despite his impropriety initially, the fact that he finally rises to be a better man by not dwelling on petty vengeance and retribution hit me in the gut and made my eyes burn with warm tears.WhereA Court of Mist and Furywas romance heavy (not that I'm complaining),A Court of Wings and Ruinwas action-packed and was cluttered with twists and magical intrigue and SJM definitely didn't let the romance aspect of the book obliterate the subplot, deftly exploring all the details.I feel weighed down by the intensity of this composition and I vow never to let it slip even from the deepest clutches of my mind ❤""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.75!""Night Triumphant- and the Stars Eternal.”I might be in the minority here but I liked ACOWAR more than ACOMAF but this has only happened during this reread before this reread the four times that I read this series I always preferred ACOMAF maybe because I loved the romance but reading this now really made me appreciate the plot and the politics in this book. This book was exactly 700 pages long and 700 pages have never felt this short because I actually flew through them and despite rereading this series every year there were still moments where I forgot certain things happen and the plot twists surprised me as well, the way it was written made it very easy to read a 700 paged book.“I see all of you, Rhys. And there is not one part that I do not love with everything I am.”FeyreI feel like Feyre is very underrated, her cunningness is overshadowed a lot by the fandom because of how compassionate she is because in this because people really rave about how cunning she was and how she made a fool out of the spring court and hey, believe me I loved that scene to probably me best part in this book but then I looked back and saw that Feyre has always been this clever and she made it till this book because of how smart she was and I just feel like its very underappreciated. I love her.“You do not fear... You do not falter. You do not yield.”RhysandI really like Rhys\'s character bur he is probably my least favorite bat boy lol. I liked him, he made rash decisions some I understood, some I did not but in the end it all worked out well. I love how cocky he was and how he presented himself with this calm composure and IDGAF attitude and I also like how he was actually nice and not a total bitch, how he helped everyone and would do anything for the people he loved. The romance between Feyre and Rhys was good as well and I liked how well it was managed in the span of three books.“We\'re all a broken, in our own ways - In places no one might see.”The Inner CircleAmren as always was the character I loved and my heart was beating so fast during those final pages because if ykyk, Cassian, him and Nesta in this book ATE and I loved him. Mor, I was justice for her, I need answers, I love her but I also want to know more about her because we only know bits and pieces about her past and nothing more and finally Azriel, I love that man so much, everything that he said and did was beautiful.“Only you can decide what breaks you, Cursebreaker. Only you.”I think the plot, the entire build up and how it all paid off was really well done and the action sequences were also detailed and really well written, The court intrigue was also something I appreciated. Especially that highlords meeting (prolly my favorite scene) and the bargains that were made, the satisfying endings that we got, the reunions and all of the massive forces aligning together with twists that you won\'t see coming and it was just really good as for the world building I am stunned how it still grew and morphed into something more beautiful.Overall, a really solid conclusion to this series and while tog remains superior, this series will have a special place in my heart!!____Listening to the graphic audio just so I can hear the loml Az say""Be careful of how you speak of my high lady""🤭Reread #4'}]"

Alice Oseman continues to deliver queer joy and charming storytelling with an adorable balance of cute romance and earnest investigations of heavy, complex emotions. It feels like it has been forever but it’s so lovely to be back with this crew.Heartstopperhas always plunged into difficult yet relatable subjects and this fifth volume is no different. Oseman has always done an excellent job at crafting her characters to feel like authentic teenagers and here we get to witness them growing up a bit more and heading into the next stage of life: college. We also get to experience Nick setting out in the world on his own while Charlie is back at home and even after 5 marvelous volumes I’m always thrilled to find the characters reading as increasingly nuanced yet still familiar. Going away to college issues were addressed in Oseman’s much earlier novellaNick and Charlie, and while this touches on some similar themes this is a completely different story.Though college isn’t the only hurdle here, as anxieties about sex dominate a lot of Charlie’s narrative. As always, Oseman does a great job at representing these issues in an age-authentic way and the character’s emotions practically jump right off the page. There’s some other interesting dynamics to this story too, from discussions on asexuality and also a peek into Charlie’s mom’s childhood. While some of the side characters are a bit more in the background, I’ve always found the series does a good job of making them all rather dynamic and interesting instead of all just extensions of the main characters.All in all, this is another heartwarming edition to an already endearing series. I can’t wait for the next volume, though *gasp* I hear it is to be the final episode in the Heartstopper saga.5/5'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""wAIT, WHY IT SAYS 2023 AND FINAL INSTALMENT?

Deadly consequences… Bestselling sensation Juniper Song is not who she says she is, she didn’t write the book she claims she wrote, and she is most certainly not Asian American—in this chilling and hilariously cutting novel from R.F. Kuang, the #1 New York Times bestselling author ofBabel.Authors June Hayward and Athena Liu were supposed to be twin rising stars. But Athena’s a literary darling. June Hayward is literally nobody. Who wants stories about basic white girls, June thinks.So when June witnesses Athena’s death in a freak accident, she acts on impulse: she steals Athena’s just-finished masterpiece, an experimental novel about the unsung contributions of Chinese laborers during World War I.So what if June edits Athena’s novel and sends it to her agent as her own work? So what if she lets her new publisher rebrand her as Juniper Song—complete with an ambiguously ethnic author photo? Doesn’t this piece of history deserve to be told, whoever the teller? That’s what June claims, and the New York Times bestseller list seems to agree.But June can’t get away from Athena’s shadow, and emerging evidence threatens to bring June’s (stolen) success down around her. As June races to protect her secret, she discovers exactly how far she will go to keep what she thinks she deserves.With its totally immersive first-person voice, Yellowface grapples with questions of diversity, racism, and cultural appropriation, as well as the terrifying alienation of social media. R.F. Kuang’s novel is timely, razor-sharp, and eminently readable.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': '2.5/5i feel weird writing this review. for one, Yellowface isn’t out until next year. two, the book is very meta about twitter and book reviews—ratings on goodreads even make up several important plot points. i feel like me and the book are engaging in some inside joke.i’ve decided not to include any quotes from the book and talk in general terms with minor details to avoid spoilers (not anything that’s not in the premise, anyway), but i’m still talking about how i felt about different parts of the book, including the middle and end, even though I won’t be talking about what happens in them. so if you want to go in blind, beware. i know this runs the risk of me describing something one way, but then you going and reading it and interpreting a different way, but until it actually comes out and i can drop the ‘extended’ (and hopefully more sophisticated) review, this will have to do.yellowface is meant to be drama and dark satire. it’s a bit hilariously grim and grimly hilarious to anyone who’s ever needed to close booktwt and touch grass, but also interesting to anyone moderately familiar with books, writing or publishing. the prose isn’t babel, where i was stopping every page to savour the writing style, but it is fast-paced and fairly easy to get through. and i’m kind of torn about yellowface, but the worst part is that i can’t figure out whether it’s in a “this didn\'t work for me, personally” way, or a more objective “this is a Critique” way.my problem with yellowface comes down to the fact that i cannot separate the narrative voice from rfk’s voice at all. a lot of the experiences of a certain character lines up very much with what i know is rfk’s own, and that is on purpose and not necessarily bad—she’s an author who’s always been very open about putting a lot of herself into her books and it’s one of the things that can add to their emotional depth. a lot of readers will likely proclaim the fact you can’t unsee the hand of the author in the writing is The Point. however, when the characters start to receive criticisms that are very similar to criticisms rfk has faced, but represented somewhat flatly, i cock my head a bit. see: problematic representation of Taiwanese indigenous people (a criticism in isolation that depnding on the book may be valid, but in yellowface is shown to be made by people who are just jealous of the author and don’t actually know what they’re talking about), privately-educated, rich western diaspora writing about traumatic histories of working classes from the homelands they’ve only visited a few times (a criticism in isolation that depending on the author may be valid, but in yellowface is made from the perspective of the racist white woman using it to justify her horrible actions), etc.this may not bother other readers, but i can’t help but side-eye it. she gets around it by having these criticisms be made by mouthpieces—that’s another thing about yellowface, by the way.so many mouthpieces.i don’t think this is a book where readers will get very attached to the characters, not just because the mc is an unreliable narrator, but because yellowface is more of a book where characters are tools that represent different things and perspectives and are meant to be grimly watched, observed and laughed at from above. which is mostly fun, until you start to distinguish between rfk’s mouthpieces a bit: which ones she represents more flatly and more caricatured, and the one she gives more nuanced paragraphs to, from under which i think I can make out the haze of her opinions. and i’m not fond of them all the time.as always, it’s certainly interesting, but the middle of the book is basically all twitter discourse. it had me wondering if i could just scroll through my timeline and get the same experience instead. it’s veryyy meta—sometimes fun, sometimes obnoxious. maybe it’s too ‘high concept’ for me, sorry, or maybe it\'s heavy-handed. and it makes my job writing this difficult, because how much can i attribute to the unreliable narrator, satirical style or rfk herself? where does one end and the other begin, if they do so at all?(which was a big thing that irked me with tpw. people would make criticisms of rfk\'s narrative choices and plot points and the response would be ‘well, rin is an unreliable narrator!’ yes, but there is such thing asframingandcontextwhich are important things to consider when trying to figure out what an author actually is saying, intentionally or not. but anyways.)speaking of slightly more well-written unreliable narrators, juniper song is… a character. more of an awful ball of jealous, racist, liberal misery who you get to follow the entertaining downward spiral of throughout the book than a person. at least, when she\'s not hindered by rfk\'s blunt writing style striking her on the head. the commentary and discussion yellowface wants to have about publishing and racism is genuinely interesting and important, but I enjoyed yellowface most when it doing less back-and-forth with its own themes and more about the fucked up relationship between athena liu and juniper song/june hayward/athena liu. ie,when it was more about actual people than rfk\'s comemntary.despite athena dying at the very start of the story, she haunts the narrative, sometimes through flashbacks, sometimes through other people’s experiences, sometimes literally. and the narrativeisjuniper. i love a good fucked up friendship/rivalry/impersonation?/whatever the fuck this is. there\'s a flashback where we find out about a fucked up thing athena did regarding a traumatic event juniper went through--something which in no way justifies the scale of what juniper does throughout the book, but muddies the waters and makes everyone involved seem like more flawed, three-dimensional people. keyword, people! and whenever that relationship had the spotlight, i couldn’t put yellowface down. it\'s insane the narrative spent more time on its self-indulgent satire than it does on its genuinely compelling emotional core.which is why i was really loving the third act, in which a lot of my criticisms seemed to fall away and the mess of the premise was really coming to a head. i was reading it late at night and, even though it’s not a horror, i got actually creeped out by several parts. to be honest, if yellowface had stuck the landing, it could have been four stars.and that’s my final problem with yellowface. it has a decent plot, interesting cast of characters, interesting themes and discussions, but my only feeling on the ending was,‘…that’s it?’i know i said i wouldn’t do quotes, but im making an exception for the bit where our narrator says,‘I’ve written myself into a corner. The first two thirds of the book were a breeze to compose, but what do i do with the ending? Where do I leave my protagonist, now that there’s no clear resolution?’Which is very meta, because based off the ending, i feel that’s the position rfk was in at that exact point. i can somewhat tell she struggled with where to take the ending and i have more thoughts on why i felt underwhelmed by it, but i guess that’ll be for 2023, for when it\'s no doubt on all the \'Very Important Books of the Year\' lists. for now, i can see myself rereading babel and parts of tpw, but i don’t see myself rereading yellowface.it\'s now 2023. in short, the ending is less a bang, and more of a whimper. rfk rules out a geoff-style ending for june, someone who disappears quietly from public memory after the scandal and becomes old news. she\'s too attached to athena\'s image. this is the right choice--june is too much of a villain-protagonist to get an unearned, \'soft\' ending at the end of this. but then the \'crash-and-burn\' ending needed to be a lot more to be satisfying for me. we get hallucinations, suicidal ideation, her isolating herself from her support network, all of this building and building and building--and then it goes...nowhere.oh, we get a fascinating final confrontation with candace, one of athena\'s fellow asian-american authors, who gets to deliver the most cutting, messy and brutal line of the book:""Who gives a fuck about Athena? Fuck Athena. We all hated that bitch. This is for me.""but what happens after?we get a prediction from june, which is basically that the cycle of controvery and scandal that this whole book has shown us for however many hundreds of pages will just keep going, and going, and going, and maybe june will win (at least in her eyes). it\'s just such a nothing ending. sure, it\'s #commentary and a criticism of the publishing and media industry, but that does not make it satisfying. it\'s not an emotional resolution, and it\'s not even a more sophisticated commentary on the cyclical nature of scandal and how white people don’t face consequences than what the story has shown us already. we\'veseenthe cycle and her getting away with it. the whole book so far has been the cycle and her getting away with it. i think it\'s a good example of what i\'ve been saying, to be honest, about how yellowface is more about The Point than any story it\'s trying to tell. The ending is all about The Point, but is not an emotional resolution to anything developed or a conclusion to any charater arcs. just ""and this will continue, because doesn\'t it always continue? isn\'t this ending so clever?"" the worst part is that itteasesyou with the prospect of something more compelling: june plays with the idea of \'accidentally\' killing candace and knowing she would get away with it because she\'s a white woman, a horrific mirror to the start of the book and a sign of june\'s complete downward spiral, because at least Athena\'s death was an actual accident (and would be a frankly brutal commitment to the “they always get away with it” message). in a different moment, it makes you wonder if june may even be the one who might die an accidental death and now candace is the one to continue this twisted cycle, a horribly circular but somewhat karmic ending. instead, the cycle continues... in the most uninspired way possible. the third act of yellowface feels like it\'s hurtling towards a great ending and then face-plants over the finish line at the last minute. despite being a protagonist who is more well-suited for a crash-and-burn ending than any other i\'ve read, juniper song doesn\'t burn. she barely sizzles. and to me, that\'s disappointing.trigger warnings for this book: racism, c slur, suicidal ideation, sexual assaultedit 24/05/2023:unsurprisingly, some people on twitter cannot fucking read, so to clarify some things: 1)i am not white. i am asian,2) I DO NOT CARE THAT JUNE WAS IRREDEEMABLE. I DID NOT WANT A REDEMPTION FOR A RACIST. my main problem was that i found the way yellowface handled its themes came at the cost of other aspects of the story when it should have been making them better. 3) ""[insert criticism here] is literally the whole point of the story omgggg how could you miss the point so bad did you even pass english lit in school etc etc."" personally, i do not enjoy 300 pages of on-the-nose commentary through uncompelling mouthpieces. i especially find it questionable when some of these mouthpieces flatly reflect criticisms the authors has actually received in regards to her previous work. if you do, more power to you! if what i disliked about the book is what you enjoyed about it, well, that\'s just how having an opinion works. i don\'t know what to tell you. i can definitely understand how someone who isn\'t as aware of some of the meta-commentary would have more enjoyment. but i find the response that i ""missed the point"" (to be honest, the writing constantly tries its best to be Desperately Sure You Are Not Missing The Point) that this book is about racism by some white readers when i\'m intimately familiar with racism, both as it pertains to real life and in media, kind of... well. racist.in a way, i guess this book is perfect for booktwitter. a lot of recognisable discourse where the Message and Themes are written out for you in big bold letters, constantly, all the time, throughout the story, just in case you missed it—that way, even your average reading-comprehension-starved twitter user can pick up on it—padded with enough relatable material about being chronically online and plenty of fictional ragebait to distract from a narrative that can’t get its teeth into its own premise and a third act that can’t deliver. target audience acquired.in line with the theme of the book, i’m going to completely steal another reviewer’s words that i can’t stop thinking about.\'the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope.\'go read it. and i’d like to add to that: a lot of her most avid readers don’t have the appetite for anything beyond that, either. and take it incredibly personally when at the end of the meal, you’re still hungry.and to be clear, this isn\'t a blanket response to everyone who disagrees with me (i\'ve had interesting conversations with people who do)--just to some people who are determined to take the most uncharitable opinion possible of a frankly lukewarm review.a book can be about an important subject matter and i can still feel it fell short of what it was trying to do. that is not me putting personal attack on the author, the author\'s identity, the subject matter itself, or any readers who enjoyed the book or their identities. i didn\'t even hate the book. i liked parts of it quite a bit. i just wanted more.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘Don’t ghosts just want to be remembered?’A book about fucking around and finding out.The question of who should or shouldn’t tell a story has been a hotly debated subject, a discourse that must also recognize the playing field is guided by rules of capitalism in a for-profit publishing industry and a social climate that prods “culture wars” to increase clicks. Still in recent memory are the debates overAmerican Dirt, which sparkedmonths of controversyover white authors using another’s cultural narrative as what many considered “trauma porn,” but also over the publisher’s decision to throw incredible amounts of marketing money at this book when immigration stories by authors living within the culture were being passed over for that novel. R.F. Kuang’sYellowfacesinks its teeth into the world of publishing and the discourses on authenticity through the eyes of June Hayward, a white woman who has taken the draft of a Chinese-American woman’s novel and published it as her own. She will forever be haunted by this choice, like a Lady Macbeth of letters haunted by bloodstains in her attempt to usurp the kingdom. It is a perfect follow-up toBabeland the conversations on how language can be a form of colonialism, though this one has no magical elements like the former. Instead,Yellowfacereads like a scandal unfolding before your eyes and transfixes the reader with all the sick satisfactions that keep us scrolling through social media debates and keep hot takes. Kuang makes us sit with our discomfort, through an excellent choice of an unreliable narrator, and forces us to confront our own opinions on the matter. With a sharp critique on the commodification and consumption of art in publishing and reviewing (even Goodreaders are not spared here), a look at online debates, the self-aggrandizing aspects of social media, and the way artists are pitted against each other as if writing was a competitive sport, Kuang’sYellowfaceasks big questions on authenticity and identity in a society that has reduced the concepts into marketing metrics.I’ll be honest, I read this book in a single sitting. I could not look away, and Kuang’s writing sweeps you up in it’s conversational cadance. While I’ve enjoyed Kuang’s writing previously,Yellowfacefeels very polished and matured, the novel reading with the ease and eagerness of a tell-all memoir, which is the framing of the story. As a fictional memoir, it drops a lot of pop culture references to key into a specific time. Kuang’s choice of perspective through June—who rebrands at the request of her publisher as Juniper Song, Song being her middle-name but also nudges readers to think she may have Chinese heritage—is brilliant as it allows us to feel the floor-dropping-out discomfort of becoming the focus of internet rage as well as navigate a vigorous criticism of the publishing industry. Kuang is able to cover issues without moralizing, making the reader sift through alternating opinions that are likely to expose their own assumptions and discomforts, and we must always remember the telling is often guiding us away from judging her and towards everyone else. With a big confession at the center, June can manipulate the reader on smaller issues and in a way it becomes a rather metafictional approach to the way storytelling is just that: fictionalizing stories.Kuang does well by creating a character that isn’t entirely unsympathetic—we need to want to keep reading her take on the events—and hate reading is a shallow effect that evaporates quickly. Not unlike the social media scandals that hit viciously and are forgotten days later. Not that June is innocent, and being disgusted with her is half the fun, but Kuang will force us to consider what exactly it is that disgusts us and what that means in a larger context about art and the commodification of it. We’ve seen these sorts of scandals, such as a personal favorite bizarre tale of Natalie Beach who wrote about beingthe ghostwriter for Caroline Calloway, or last year’sWho Is the Bad Art Friend?article concerning Sonya Larson and Dawn Dorland where everyone seemed to be too thrilled by the mess to not pick a side. Though the story that seems closest toYellowfaceis the one surroundingKristen Roupenian’s short storyCat Person(you canread it here) which was defended then later attacked whenan article revealing the details was taken from a strangers real life, told to the author by the man who was fictionalized in the story as the sex pest and later committed suicide in real life. Twitter was full of well-known authors debating if personal details and stories of others are always fair game, even though the hometown and place of employment of the girl was not changed for the published version (my college roommate later rented the house Roupenian had previously lived in and describes in story). Literary twitter was confronted with a situation about what level of authenticity is appropriate and can someone tell someone else’s story.The way social media fuels a fire is at the heart of this story, with twitter challenging authenticity and morals at all times. Which becomes a tragic interplay at the way authors are demanded to be vulnerable, to seek authenticity and expose their pain for book sales, yet social media loves to exploit personal details and use vulnerabilities as an opening for an attack.‘dozen, maybe hundreds, maybethousandsof strangers are out there, mining your personal information, worming their ways into your life, looking for ways to mock, humiliate, or worse, endanger you. You come to regret everything you’ve ever shared about yourself…because the trollswillfind them.’We’ve all most likely criticized a stranger on social media, sometimes the pile-ups are too fun and humorous to not get a joke in, but Kuang tries to remind us that the targets are real people with real feelings. Sure, June deserves to be exposed and feel bad for what she’s done, but Kuang puts us in her shoes and lets you feel what being a target is like. Because it can come for anyone, even Athena was once the target of harassment, death threats and hacking where she didn’t feel safe all for being called a ‘race traitor’ for dating a white man. ‘In destroying her,’ June narrates the voice of social media, ‘we create an audience we create moral authority for ourselves.’ Such is the nature of social media in the state of a scandal, and all for what? ‘Allegations get flung left and right, everyone’s reputations are torn down, and when the dust clears, everything remains exactly as it was.’ Nothing changes, but, as we see in the novel, much of this is because someone profits from it. A scandal often turns into book sales (for all the complaintsAmerican Dirtwas canceled it still remained a bestseller for months) and if you keep selling books you keep getting published.‘The living are burdened with bodies. They make shadows, footprints.’But lets move to the scandal at hand. Here we have June, who has a tepid friendship with rising literary star Athena Liu. She feels jealous as well as annoyance with Athena, fantasizing how she’d like to ‘neatly peel her skin off her body like an orange and zip it up over myself,’ something she is soon metaphorically doing when she edits the now deceased Athena’s manuscript: a WW1 novel about Chinese laborers. It starts off innocently enough (or so June claims) being an exercise in editing that she gets so caught up in loving writing again that she passes it off as herself. It is titledThe Last Front, is praised for a mosaic storytelling style reminiscent of the filmDunkirkand becomes an instant bestseller. She will spend the novel fiercely defending she has the right to tell this story—sometimes being rewarded such as when speaking at a Chinese American Social Club she is thanked by a man who’s Chinese father fought in the war for making sure their stories are told—yet at the end of the day, this never was her story. And while she can be a great writer, we see she is never able to come up with her own ideas and the ones she have is derivative of other stories. It is a subtle and clever nod to a gap between being a good writer and being a good author or creator (an offer to write for existing IP disgusts her, perhaps because she is confronted by what she doesn’t want to admit is her strength).‘It all boils down to self-interest…If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it\'s rigged in your favor.’While the marketing grab here is definitely the idea of colonizing another’s work and culture and passing it off as your own (there are many moments for readers to fist bump the novel and say “HAHA take that shit, “Junie””) Kuang makes this a symptom of a larger issue. In her acknowledgements, Kuang states that the novel is a ‘horror story about loneliness in a fiercely competitive industry.’ If your ears perked up at horror story, therearesome horror elements late in the novel (though perhaps not enough and it could have been threaded in longer, if I have one complaint it is that the novels episodic feel never quite let individual elements breathe enough and makes the last portion feel a bit like going one step more than needed instead of flowing from the book which would have sidestepped that feeling? Maybe thats just me though). But loneliness does permeate this tale, and we see how authors can feel crushed under the way for-profit publishing makes it a competition who awards winners and losers. One author will get a huge deal and seemingly inexhaustible marketing, while another gets one small print run and no publisher support. Kuang looks at publishing as a rigged enterprise, with a small team of (mostly white) executives deciding what gets sold and more or less deciding what will be a bestseller and informing readers to follow suit. Its not a secret that publishers buy space in chain bookstores or that the Big 5 US publishers are80% of all publishing revenue. It is a market based on profit, and will be manipulated to ensure profits keep coming.‘This industry is built on silencing us, stomping us into the ground, and hurling money at white people to produce racist stereotypes of us.’To June, however, she sees diversity as a problem, thinking she is passed over for authors like Athena because it looks good. Which, if we look at the publishing market, shows that about75% of published authors in the US are whiteand a 2020 study showed95% of all books published were by white authorsthe previous year.Now everyone probably remembers 2020 was the year many corporations made pledges to be better at diversity, the publishing industry under extra scrutiny as Black authors and anti-racism books were topping the best sellers and showing there was indeed a market for such books, but lets look at the industry itself. Since then,a recent survey shows only a 1% changein the industry, with it being 83% white and that most non-white hires since 2020 are for marketing positions. Which is using “diversity” as a sales technique again.So what June see’s as a fast-track to success is actually a steep uphill climb. ‘""Do you know how much shit Athena got from this industry?’ a character remarks late in the novel, ‘They marked her as their token, exotic Asian girl. Every time she tried to branch out to new projects, they kept insisting that Asian was her brand, was what her audience expected.’ To be a brand is what publishing reduces identity into is the argument seen in the novel. And, if one is reduced to being a brand of themselves, they are now in market competition. I think of author Brandon Taylor saying identity becomes a marketing pitch, and howReal Lifewas reviewed as about identity when he says it was about lonely that happened to have explorations of identity in the book. I\'m reminded of thereasons authors pushed against #OwnVoiceslabels asBecky Albertallifelt forced to come out to ""justify"" her book and others felt boxed in by it.‘Do you know what it\'s like to pitch a book and be told they already have an Asian writer? That they can\'t put out two minority stories in the same season? That Athena Liu already exists, so you\'re redundant?’Kuang examines how the idea of being a brand exists in the outskirts of publishing as well. We have the twitter fights where people exist as a self-brand of being antagonists, we have goodreads reviewers where their brand is taking down popular authors (some lines that may sting are remarks from other authors to not read goodreads and harsh takes are more about feeding ego than worthwhile criticism), and journalists who make a brand at hot takes. However, we have to remember that June is directing us to look at howeveryone elseis the problem instead of her. So while through her telling many of the critiques are cast as villains, the fictional journalist Adele Sparks-Sato (a nod toAndrea Long ChuasVartika pointed out) is not wrong when writing that June’s version of Athena’s novel ‘joins novels likeThe HelpandThe Good Earthin a long line of what I dub historical exploitation novels: inauthentic stories that use troubled pasts as an entertaining set piece for white entertainment.’‘The appropriation of history, the historicization of the past, the narrativization of society, all of which give the novel its force, include the accumulation and differentiation of social space, space to be used for social purposes.’-Edward Said,Culture and ImperialismThere is a good deal of nuance in this book about how the commodification of art is an issue, but also a reminder that we can’t scapegoat our own actions on that entirely. There are some great little jabs in this—Junie Song ordering a Miss Saigon drink only to find it “too sweet” for her tastes—and it does emphasize the problems of representing a different culture from a western lens. AsEdward Saidwrote ‘the power to narrate, or to block other narratives from forming and emerging is very important to culture and imperialism,’ and argued that literature can be a form of colonialism by establishing a perception of a different culture or geography, and in the editing process ofThe Last Frontwe watch June make concessions on the text in order to appeal more to a white reader as requested by her publisher. Yes, she did actually do a great deal of research, and her opinion is the criticisms of cultural issues in the book are ‘exclusive cultural snobbishness and authenticity testing’ that ‘are only a form of gatekeeping,’ though later criticisms of her book are that her misunderstanding of how names or families work, or how her positions on certain issues imply a stance on current Chinese politics that are so beyond her understanding can be harmful. Some readers find it to read as a white-savioir narrative, something we know was manufactured by changing certain characters to be white characters to better fit the market needs. Which also returns us to the idea that art under capitalism will always be in service to profits.Yellowfaceby R.F. Kuang is a delightful novel with the fierceness of an unfolding scandal that makes us confront many key issues hotly debated in the literary world right now. I enjoyed the nuance here in how it exposes problems from many angles, but does not allow that to be an excuse for bad behavior. Understanding is not the same as condoning here, and it is a page-turning trip watching June dip and dodge as her usurped empire continuously threatens to crash down around her. Kuang writes with confidence and precision andYellowfacemakes for an excellent look at the literary world and the commodification of art.4.5/5‘Isn’t that what ghosts do? Howl, moan, make themselves into spectacles? That’s the whole point of a ghost, is it not? Anything to remind you that they’re still there. Anything to keep you from forgetting.’Update: I got to hear R.F. Kuang speak about the book yesterday! She was DELIGHTFUL, discussed why she dislikes how publishing turns identity into marketing metrics, the booksBeautiful World, Where Are You, Ferrante\'s Neapolitan novels and told everyone to readMurderbot. So well spoken, intelligent, and a real wonderful author.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'lmao.the frustration, as always, is that rf kuang is an intelligent and steady-handed writer. she is ahead of many of her peers in craft as much as sales: she writes a page-turner, she crafts a strong perspective, she is horror-writer good at making the reader feel gut-churning revulsion (whether or not she earns the strong emotion she likes to pull out is another question), and in this book she\'s capable of being funny. like here\'s a perfect paragraph, in which our pernicious white heroine works with her editor to chop and change the manuscript she stole:The hardest part is keeping track of all the characters. We change almost a dozen names to reduce confusion. Two different characters have the last name Zhang, and four have the last name Li. Athena differentiates them by giving them different first names, which she only occasionally uses, and other names that I assume are nicknames (A Geng, A Zhu; unless A is a last name and I’m missing something), or Da Liu and Xiao Liu, which throws me for a loop because I thought Liu was a last name, so what are Da and Xiao doing there? Why are so many of the female characters named Xiao as well? And if they’re family names, does that mean everyone is related? Is this a novel aboutincest? But the easy fix is to give them all distinct monikers, and I spend hours scrolling through pages on Chinese history and baby name sites to find names that will be culturally appropriate.like it\'s absolutely executing all of its tricks as it should: the blinkers of a close first person perspective, the legible different reality underneath. it\'s not subtle but when done in satire it\'s not AS hamhanded as kuang\'s dramatic instincts, per other books. readers who know chinese will scream, readers who don\'t will still feel their brain itch. the authorial hand is capable.the author is capable... of more than she writes. the problem with kuang is that, despite a reputation for in-depth research, she refuses to interrogate beyond her scope. in previous books that meant that the sense of history was strong and the rest of the work of writing fiction—character work, plot, tone, anything reliant on the imagination—was comparatively weak. here there\'s no research to hold it up, just kuang\'s own posting habits and career success. the step down from jstor to twitter is a violent stumble.kuang is an accomplished academic but a deeply incurious writer. that is on sharp display here, in a book that is meant to depict success and failure in the literary-commercial circuit—something that kuang knows little about. kuang is a genre writer who achieved crossover commercial success after blowing up on tiktok. her debut was promising and lauded but not uniquely vaunted; she received genre award noms (not wins) but her books blew up on tiktok after the fact and she launched an incredibly successful book this yearin the genre space, off the back of her tiktok fame. everything she knows about succeeding she knows about inside her particular bubble, and also, because she has been succeeding since she was an undergrad baby, has been told—and genuinely believes—that she has hit the summit of success. this leaves her totally inequipped to write about what literary success looks like when engineered by the house. r.f. kuang has no belief that there is a form of publishing greatness beyond that which has been bestowed upon r.f. kuang, and a wilful desire not to google further.the \'publishing details\' on display are... well, they all exist IN publishing, curate a FORM of commercial success, and are familiar to kuang, but they don\'t match the book as described here (a lit-commercial wwii doorstopper, written by a chinese-american author and butchered into commercial sentimentality by a white author and editor, think the bulletproof success of american dirt even in the thick of its cancellation). mainstream literary successes don\'t come up through pitchwars. mainstream commercial novels don\'t come up in most book box deals because there is a form of literary success that is not reliant on superfans buying multiple copies apiece. there\'s a part where our heroine lists the major american literary awards her major literary-commercial war novel is up for and starts with: the goodreads choice awards. posting FROM this bad website: please be serious. it\'s fitting that the cover looks more like a designed arc than like a book.there\'s a note in the babel prologue that i think about all the time with kuang\'s work, where she says that she was so dazzled by the sight of an oyster tower at a particular oxford party that she put it in the book even though oysters in victorian england were trash food for peasants—she didn\'t want to capture the dazzle or the waste so much as she wanted to write down her experience beat for beat, and could not conceive of an emotional reality that she did not personally live. this is an oyster tower book. this is embarrassing and technically inaccurate mimesis all the way down, solely interested in kuang\'s own interests. wow your heroines live in dc? and you lived in dc? they met at yale? you go to yale? omigod rebecca that\'s so crazy. there was a shorthand term back in the sporking days (i know, i hate my withered hag fingers for typing this too) on LIVEJOURNAL (HAG FINGERS) called \'pepper jack cheese\' that was like ""hermione ate a sandwich with pepper jack cheese (a/n: that\'s my favorite cheese!)"", the phenomenon where the author would gigglingly and obviously insert a few of their real-life favorite things into the story. kuang\'s pepper jack cheese is whistlepig whiskey, name-dropped bafflingly twice as a signifier for the nicest possible whiskey, and also every single detail.it is like. skin-crawlingly secondhand embarrassing to watch an author write their own life beat for beat and also be like \'everyone hated her because she was TOO pretty and TOO smart\'. every critique that has ever been leveled against kuang goes into the mouth of her proxy\'s haters, including the pernicious and grasping white heroine. the belief that her haters are racist comes in a distant second to the belief that her haters are jealous—of her success, of her telegenic prettiness, of her comfortable life. maybe baby but look at the material: there\'s room for improvement. it is disappointing to watch someone technically skilled grind their intellectual curiosity down to a nub via posting and self-obsession, and it\'s humiliating to watch an oxbridge-ivy phd student say \'talk to the hand! and DON\'T tell me to log off\' for three hundo pages. is this the best she can do? does SHE think this is the best she can do? i\'m worried that she does.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Whew child. Some of these reviews are doing exactly what Kuang was pointing out throughYellowface. It’s interesting to watch it happen in real time. While I don’t have extensive knowledge of her work, I think what Kuang is doing in this book is actually quite brilliant.At the most basic of levels,Yellowfaceis a mash of various genres that follows the passive aggressive “friendship” of Athena and June, two authors in the publishing industry with very different levels of success. Athena has received her big break while June has remained a struggling author. In an absurd (truly absurd if I’m being quite honest haha) turn of events, Athena chokes while engaging in a pancake eating contest with June. After her death, June makes the decision to steal one of her manuscripts and pass it off as her own. What follows next is chaotic descent into the world of publishing and the book community.What Worked:SO MUCH OF THIS BOOOK WORKED! I’ve seen the countless criticisms of Kuang inserting herself too much into this book as well as the criticisms that indicate that there isn’t much to be gained from reading this book. I wholeheartedly disagree. Oh, my friends, there is much to be gained. Neither of the characters is likeable and that is INTENTIONAL. This isn’t a way to illustrate that everyone in publishing is selfish, but a means to question how much the reader falls into the trap of engaging with the model minority myth. The expectation that Athena is supposed to be likeable is deeply woven in the sociological phenomena that stereotypes many Asian communities as successful, smart, likeable, diligent, docile, etc and the idea that Athena doesn’t fit into that role has made some readers feel uncomfortable whether it is consciously or subconsciously.Kuang’s evaluation of the publishing industry is layered and forces both publishing and the bookish community to do some reevaluation. What she singlehandedly captures in this book has been the biggest criticism that many of us have been vocal about since 2020. Publishing used the death of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement to claim to want more diversity and has in some ways published more diverse books; however, have we really paid attention to what those stories have centered? Trauma versus joy. So many of these stories have been centered on generational trauma, books that are used to educate and make the White masses feel better about not knowing much about diverse experiences prior to 2020. Marginalized voices in publishing are “permitted” to be a part of the community as long we play the roles that we are supposed to play. Once we begin to infiltrate the industry too much, those same people with “BLM” in their twitter bios, the same people who claim to be liberal do the same damn mental gymnastics June did to excuse her behavior. The system was designed for June to do what she did and the moment that marginalized communities “steal” the shine, it’s okay to push back because as June believes she’s the true minority and oppressed person in all of this. Don’t believe me, you should check out the TikTok made by an author who claims that white writers now get turned down because all agents want are BIPOC writers. Or better yet, just listen to foolishness that was uttered from James Patterson who had the audacity to state the White men are the truly oppressed writers in the industry.And let’s take this a step further and look at how Kuang illustrated the danger that publishing has ultimately created with it’s use of terms like #ownvoices. Athena wasn’t ever allowed to write outside of trauma. She’s pigeonholed into only writing one thing. And honestly, I’m sure that happens more than we would like to believe. Authors who want to explore something outside of their “assigned” roles either get turned down or the marketing is trash. It delves deeper into the question of who is allowed to tell what story? Was Athena any better of a fit to tell the story of Chinese laborers of WWI than June? Is research enough to tell something outside of one’s lived experience? These are things to think about and something that we are confronted with every day in this community. Think about books likeAmerican DirtandMemoirs of a Geisha.This book is both absurd and unhinged because so is publishing and the book community. And I’ve been involved in all of it for so many years. Kuang told ya’ll to kiss her ass with this book. She is behaving in the complete opposite manner that is “expected” of her as young, thin, conventionally beautiful Asian woman. And the fact that she owns that shit makes so many people feel uncomfortable. And quite frankly I applaud her for that. BIPOC writers and creators are tired of the expectation that we are supposed to behave, create, write, and provide educational pieces in way that makes others feel comfortable. We’re supposed to applaud White people for the amazing work they’ve done in “allowing” us to enter the spaces and “give” us the opportunity to tell “our stories.” It’s laughable at this point and while ya’ll give Kuang these 1 and 2 star reviews, she’s going to be laughing her pretty, thin, and educated ass all the way to the damn bank.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'If publishing is rigged, you might as well make sure it’s rigged in your favor.4.5 stars. Holy shit, I had an absolute blast reading this! I inhaled it in a day. Forgive me if I make no sense because I stayed up late to finish it!To be honest, I wasn\'t going to readYellowface. I found Kuang\'sBabelto be so painfully boring and didactic, like reading a textbook, that I thought we were parting ways for good. But then it seemed like everyone I know read this and liked it, so curiosity got the better of me.And, wow, is this really the same author? What a ride. The suspense! The vitriol! The fucking audacity!I want to take a moment to acknowledge something I found quite ironic-- Kuang\'s other books are fantasy books about magic and colonialism and boarding schools while this one has the very lukewarm premise of being about authors and the publishing process... but, my god, when it comes to pageturners evenThe Poppy Warhad nothing on this.A satire, is it? Well, maybe, but I\'ve never read such a gripping and suspenseful satire. Kuang rips the publishing industry to shreds with this book, and she does it from the perspective of a white author who steals the first draft manuscript of a dead Chinese author.I sat open-mouthed pretty much the entire time wondering if she was going to get away with it or get caught. Kuang uses a lot of social media to tell this story and it is highly effective at keeping the pacing up. We all know social media is a shitstorm of people vying for attention, performing for validation and, occasionally, making genuinely important points, and we see it all play out here to the extreme.I thoughtBabellacked nuance, butYellowfaceis the complete opposite. Both June and Athena are complex characters. Athena is not allowed to simply be the perfect victim and, in fact, what emerges over the course of the novel is someone who is quite unlikable herself. June has done something objectively bad, but the author resists the temptation to paint her as one-dimensional. Her desperation and self-delusion, her anxiety and her jealousy, feel real.At first glance, June appears to be the villain, but I think it becomes clear as the story progresses that this is much bigger than June. Kuang calls out the publishing industry and the messed up way books are primarily marketed through a social media performance. The young authors choking on their jealousy as they are pitted against one another. The agents and editors urging authors to publish “anything” while they have “social capital” regardless of whether it’s good or not.And, of course, the way many in the publishing industry view ""diversity"" as a marketing buzzword to sell more books, rather than having the genuinely noble goal of diversifying literature. As Brett, June\'s agent, admits at one point:""But at the end of the day all that really matters is cash flow.""This is a chaotic, highly-frustrating, impossible-to-put-down book. I rollercoasted from emotion to emotion reading it and I\'m sure I will still be talking about it long after I\'m done writing this review.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This is a compelling, cynical, and thought-provoking satire that delves into themes of plagiarism, racism, and internet trolling. It offers a realistic portrayal of the publishing industry within the framework of a heart-pounding thriller. The story revolves around an anti-heroine driven by power and insecurity, who assumes the identity of her deceased friend to publish a masterpiece. Loneliness and the desperate desire for recognition serve as driving forces, pushing the protagonist to extreme measures.Remarkably, I found myself attached to a book despite disliking the main character. At times, I wished I could physically enter the story and confront June Hayward/ Juniper Song, who committed the ultimate crime: stealing her late friend Athena Liu\'s unpublished book. The reasons behind this act of creative theft are complex and include jealousy, thirst for power, honoring her friend\'s work in the best way possible, and seeking personal gain. It is a tale that explores unfairness, harbored resentment, and a thirst for karmic justice.One of the standout aspects of the book is the author\'s astute commentary on the perils faced by writers, such as internet trolls who use their freedom of speech rights to berate and belittle their creations. The story skillfully examines the commodification of writers, where their looks, personality, color of their skin and online presence become as important as their writing itself.This book truly blew my mind. I was unable to put it down, yet also needed to take breaks due to the chaotic and anxiety-inducing experience of living within Juniper\'s mind. The character evokes strong emotions, including frustration towards her misogyny, blind ambition, and obnoxious justifications for her actions.It is worth noting that Juniper is not the sole antagonist in the narrative. The judgmental and self-righteous individuals surrounding her also exhibit misogynistic tendencies and relish in criticizing and witnessing the downfall of others, all while raising their champagne glasses in celebration. Even Athena, portrayed as socially awkward and naive, adds depth to the story as a potential soul-sucking character for a gripping plotline.In this book, nobody is a saint, as being good-hearted does not guarantee financial security, career success, fame, or power. The author skillfully portrays flawed and complex characters who challenge the reader\'s perceptions.Overall, this realistic and thrilling read left me feeling anxious and evoked a multitude of emotions including fear, hate, and sadness. It successfully accomplished its mission of shaking the reader to their core and provoking deep thoughts that linger for days. The essence of a masterpiece lies in its ability to challenge readers and evoke a range of feelings, and this book achieves just that.I wholeheartedly consider this one of the best books of the year, and I urge you not to overlook it or let it languish in your ""to be read"" list.

You write 'em, I read 'em. And the ones I like best tend to be a little bit tongue-in-cheek and satirical, inviting you to see the world through the plagiarist's eyes. After all, they're not really bad people, are they? They see a story that needs telling, and they're the ones to tell it. So what if the story isn't theirs to tell in the first place?And soYellowfaceenters that arena with its own take on this eyebrow-raising topic. And right off the bat, I'm intrigued. June is an interesting plagiarist-protagonist. She starts off as a writer struggling for relevance, and that struggle is something we can all relate to. It's not as if she decides to become a plagiarist overnight. No, it's a slippery slope of small decisions, each one understandable on its own, that ultimately lands her in such an ignoble profession.Once I started, I couldn't put it down. June's voice is as compelling as it is grotesque, and it's hard to look away from such self-inflicted catastrophe. You know this isn't going to turn out well, and yet she just keeps going. The best satires always elicit a lot of wincing, and that definitely happened here.I don't mind telling you guys that this story made me uncomfortable. And I'm sure that is R.F. Kuang's intention. June isn't some crazy thief, at least not initially. Rather, she's drawn as this morally ambiguous, somewhat sympathetic character. In fact, from certain angles, she looks almost downright reasonable, making the best of what she's got. And this sly characterization leaves the reader both fascinated and uneasy, for we feel drawn towards June even though she is the villain of this tale. And that cognitive dissonance stays with us throughout.The first half of the book was particularly strong for me because of that perfect balance between hero and antihero. There's a lot of subtlety that allows June to be both appealing and repulsive. However, once we get to June's book release and her subsequent guilt and justification, it does start to take on more and more of a crazed tinge, and as a result, lost a lot of the subtlety that made the first half so compelling for me.There is a lot packed into this little story: racial commentary, inside look at being a writer and the publishing industry, internet trolling, cultural appropriation. And it's all done seamlessly. I have to applaud the author for both not being afraid to wade into these interesting topics, as well as saying something of substance about each of them.What a fascinating story this turned out to be. Subversive and uncomfortable, it really drew me in and kept me glued to the pages.

This is a book worthy of discussion. It has both blatant and nuanced themes of racism and xenophobia that might go over some reader\'s heads or might seem too in-your-face for others. A group discussion can help reader\'s recognize the realism of R.F. Kuang\'s literary approach and see that even if you don\'t relate to the content, you still have to understand that it\'s other people\'s reality.Will you enjoy a single character? Categorically NO. But you will walk away with a greater understanding of the many failings of the publishing industry and how you might be unconsciously taking part in some of those failings.It\'s eye opening. It\'s ballsy. It\'s crass. It\'s wild and brilliant.I will say that the half star reduction is solely because of Candice. While her insistence upon sensitivity reader\'s was a good call in my opinion, her manner of calling things out and getting things done were over-dramatized to the nth degree. While I think R.F. Kuang is brilliant for having the opposing side of June also be contrarian, Candice didn\'t fill the spot I wanted her to in opposition to June. I know it wasn\'t a character to necessarily root for instead of June. But I saw June\'s motives and her horrible mental manipulation that she attempted to gaslight ourselves into believing were just. But Candice just felt cartoonishly villainous.

Cause I\'m gonna write it so well, you\'ll be begging to publish it.""I thought that RF Kuang was going to write about her experience with publishing through the eyes of the main character. But that\'s the direct opposite approach she takes. Her self-insert is actually with Athena, the main character\'s college friend turned renowned author.The main character is a depiction of mild mannered racist individuals who shroud themselves in acceptance as long as it doesn\'t affect them and balk at the idea of racism until directly faced with equality and the loss of superiority it gives them.This is an excellent look at how real and deep rooted racism is. It\'s everywhere and in everyone. It just isn\'t always shouting it\'s ideals. It\'s sitting still while someone else does something harmful. It\'s deluding yourself when you get the job over someone of color when you know you\'re under qualified. It\'s in so many small and micro ways. And it\'s absolutely vile to watch/read. But very eye opening in a way that I think is necessary for the publishing industry as it stands.I so appreciate RF Kuang for writing this and continuing to be an absolute genius.

It was so in-depth into the industry it made my heart sing and despare at the same time (as a publishing post-graduate first and then as a compulsive reader part of the online community). It managed to highlight a slew of things that make publishing not such a great place to be at in very few pages and I'm amazed. To me this book kind of felt like a very long article but with twists and turns. Now I know why they released arcs so early (looking at you, HarperCollins 👀). Book twitter will have a field day with this one...What a choice to have the main narrative voice be the plagiarizer (and in first person at that).Both Athena and June are awful people, and I love that neither of them is a saint, but reading the entire thing from June's pov? Insane. She's a frustrating character, not gonna lie, but she's also deliciously realistic as a two-faced, self-absorbed and dishonest manipulator that always has an excuse ready. She goes out of her way to say to the reader that she wants to do something for poc every chance she gets, but the reality is that she's a bitch trying to profit from it all in an industry that lets her do it. Sometimes it's subtle, sometimes it's not too difficult to miss her slipping into a plain wrong mentality and lol, basic whiteness.You think you're safe as the external reader? Not a chance.I'm not proud to say I fell straight into R.F. Kuang's trap, because was I seriously rooting for such a cheater the entire time? This book brainwashed me into supporting someone who stole a whole manuscript immediately after witnessing the author's death and reaching stardom by publishing it as her own. I got to the point where I was scared she was going to get caught and hoped she would get out of it unscathed.My brain ignored all the red flags and procedeed to scam me until the very end.I mean, of course I ended up wishing she would kill someone to shut them up. Of course I got second-hand anxiety from her messing up with her publishing team and at her events. Of course I cared about her mental health. Am I okay or what? Is it time for me to get theraphy too?On the other hand, Athena is harder to grasp.You really need to have the whole picture with her, which you only get by reading the book till the end.I loved the way RFK slowly built her character. You only read about her from June's perpective when she's already dead and still she comes through as the main character, not less because June is literally obsessed with her. Well-written toxic friendships are my bread and butter and the one in here was one of my favorites. The way it was dealt with: nothing less of spectacular. I found June's morality to be the most interesting aspect of this book, but the relationship between her and Athena comes in second for sure.Much care went into the secondary characters too.Even when they only fully appeared once or twice, they always had a well-rounded story behind them.I can apply that specifically to the publishing team and Geoff. From that last one it's again apparent and so on-the-nose how me and RFK's morally grey characters just work together. What can I say? I'm fascinated with them. Geoff reminded me of so many white male authors on twitter but he just had a pull. I loved that he was so pathetic, that I never knew what he was going to do and then, when I least expected it and as naturally as possible, he showed a completely different side to himself.There are a couple of things I didn't completely enjoy, mainly the pop culture references (way too many, half of them were necessary, the others not so much), and the ending.Overall the ending itself wasn't bad, I loved how it wrapped up, but that final showdown bordered on cartoonish and because of that it was hard to take it seriously. I also feel like the final chapter is missing, although I understand what this novel is actually supposed to be (have I said meta already?).In conclusion, an amazing foray into general fiction by R.F. Kuang. I swear this woman can do no wrong.

They state, ""Criticizing the opinions of others is permitted, but attacking individuals for their opinions is not.""Personally, I have never had a problem with an author, publisher, or GoodReads so you can write negative reviews (just make sure not to violate the Community Guidelines).This book does bring up some interesting points around who gets to tell certain stories and plagiarism.I found this issue of plagiarism particularly ironic because Yellowface didn\'t strike me as very original, essentially a mashup ofThe Plot by Jean Hanoff KorelitzandThe Wonderful Wizard of Oz by L Frank Baum. Furthermore, RF Kuang had a scene inThe Poppy War (published 2018)where the main character was training by carrying a pig up a mountain.Well, there is a story inHoles (published 1998)by Louis Sachar where someone carries a pig up a mountain.However, people create retellings all the time. There are lots of familiar and time-tested tropes and plots. At what point is it plagiarism?

If Rebbeca Kuang saw this quote, she must have mixed it up because she wrote this book as though it\'s meant for children who want to graduate to adult fiction.Yellowface is an unsubtle, hammer-to-the-forehead quasi-treatise about the dangers of White Women. Those villainised hacks who never see how what they\'re doing is wrong. They\'re Karens, but they voted for Biden. No really, June Hayward says she is a Democrat, and liberal, and voted for Biden multiple times within the book. Hayward a mediocre author who is friends (and we\'re not really convinced why) with a Chinese American literary star Athena Liu who dies suddenly after a pancake goes down the wrong hole, and Hayward is too inept to perform the Heimlich manoeuvre.After this, Hayward steals Liu\'s manuscript about Chinese laborers forcefully conscripted by the French during World War 1. The caucasity is unsurprising, trite, and racist covering all the beats we experienced every time we covered Discourse about films like The Blindside, Hidden Figures Greenbook, and books like The Help, or American Dirt.This book is not funny, it\'s not particularly well-written, with a literal typo in the first few pagesThe editor who did got fired,. The narrative is repetitive and disjointed, like puzzle pieces forced together from different boxes. There were scenes where June\'s narration is simply exhausting.I have to remind Athena this every single time. She has a goldfish’s memory when it comes to my problems—it takes two or three repetitions for anything to stick.First of all, Rebecca, goldfish don\'t have short memories. Some can keep them for years. Secondly, you already said this multiple times. We aren\'t ""goldfish"", we aren\'t sieves. We don\'t need incessant spoonfeeding about something you already said. In the opening stints, June mentions how her debut was left to languish by her editor at the pathetic imprint that was the only one that gave her a chance. It didn\'t need to be repeated. It also speaks to a certain lack of, perhaps, awareness by Rebecca about how publishing classifies books. When they acquire a manuscript, the books are then delineated, and different budgets are assigned to the books based on what they think will be most profitable. In the current environment, poorly written horny romantasy, AI and climate change scare stories, American POC history and struggle porn, badly written romance, and whatever book Booktok bestows its benevolent virality are the ones most likely to get publishing buzz.Majority of the authors are very white, very North American, or very British. June\'s lack of awareness of how publishing works spoke more to Rebecca\'s ignorance or laziness. And ultimately, her scapegoating of publishing ""wanting diverse stories"" rings hollow. Maybe this story would have been better if June had whitewashed a literary navel-gazing story about vulnerability and identity.Beyond the amateurish prose that suffered from sudden bursts of Thesaurus-itis, for example, on Pg. 6 Rebecca writes,It’s so fucking arbitrary. Or perhaps not arbitrary, but it hinges on factors that have nothing to do with the strength of one’s prose.then on Pg. 102Can\'t we all get behind decrying antimiscegenation?June also says Athena\'s prose is repetitive while her monologues feel like a scratched CD. One could argue that Rebecca is trying to show how June is unaware of her lack of talent but you can\'t help but wonder if she is just a serviceable writer. The book takes pains to be accessible for mass audiences. Rebecca also wants to explain every little detail such as ARCs and sensitivity readers-jargon everyone who is involved in The Community would know. June even goes on a diatribe when discussing a potential movie deal and says,Accessibility matters.and when undressing the stolen manuscript that\'s ""difficult"" to read, she says,It’s distracting from the central narrative. Reading should be an enjoyable experience, not a chore.Is this satire or Rebecca explaining why the prose is so bland and repetitive.My suspension of disbelief was unwilling and abused by how ridiculous some of the events in publishing happen. When June mentions the Goodreads Choice Awards more times than more prestigious ones, I couldn\'t help but wonder if Rebecca doesn\'t understand literary Oscars season or if she was trying to pander to Goodreads Choice Awards voters (this book will definitely be listed under Best Fiction). The GCAs are a popularity contest. Rarely do people read all the books listed, they only vote for what they loved. Additionally, no discerning reader who wants a book about Chinese labourers in WW1 would give a fuck about GCAs.Or is this a 4D chess Trojan horse where readers are actually being unwittingly tested as a focus group? Some people will prefer a female friendship story where race dynamics are explored (The Hate U Give), or perhaps they will want a thriller involving authors and books (Too Close To Home by Linwood Barclay), a meta narrative about who gets to tell a story (Bad Art Friend), a serial plagiariser (look up Jumi Bello), or Asian American nonfiction (Minor Feelings) and Rebecca can pick her next project. Maybe Rebecca is staging herself as the host of the round table to discuss whether authors should interact with reviews. But as we saw with Lauren Hough, the answer is still no.There was also a glaring pattern where June kept pointing out Athena\'s flaws. How she was once the actual bad art friend, how Twitter Hot Take enthusiasts called her a race traitor. But we never get to delve into that because June believesno one is that deep into Chinese history or politics. Great job, Rebecca. You have shut down your critics for the lack of nuance in Asian history and characters in Babel. Athena is so offensively superficially written that I almost wished we had gotten her point of view, as a villain who wants to step on all faces to the top of the literary throne. The few snippets we get of her prose show she\'s a much better writer than June and her narration would have been more palatable than June\'s weapons of mass boredom.There\'s a certain Discourse we\'re supposed to have from this book about Bad White Women, and how publishing serves to silence writers of colour. We also have to discuss who gets to tell certain stories. The problem is, we have spoken about this ad nauseum. So who is this book for? Outsiders who would like to know how it works? Adults who wanted a meta vivisection of this insular world but with Dark Themes?Rebecca doesn\'t know. She says it\'s a thriller examining the idiosyncracies of publishing. It\'s not thrilling. And it has a myopic view of how publishing works. About good intentions that went poorly when June always set out to usurp Athena\'s work from the jump? It\'s not satire. It\'s a reverse Künstlerroman. Why is it necessary? The book doesn\'t tell you because it ends like a flaccid plateau. Not only is it boring, but it\'s just a meme of a clueless White Woman.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Goodreads Choice Awards Winner - Best FictionGoodreads Choice Awards Final Round - Best FictionGoodreads Choice Awards Opening Round - Best FictionAPI MonthWhat does colonialism do to a person?

I thought it was very inappropriate how the author used an objectively bitchy and untrustworthy narrator as a mouthpiece for all of the REAL LIFE criticisms that the actual author has received in real life. By doing this, all of the critiques seem like they come from people who are just jealous and have no valid arguments against her self-insert martyr author character Athena (who mirrors the real life author in many, MANY ways). I read this book one year before it was actually published, so there might have been changes, but from this video and other reviews I\'ve seen, not much is different from when I first read it.I will be honest up front: this review is entirely plagiarized.Was I not meant to admit that? Should I have, instead, gone on long, rambling, and yet tersely flat paragraphs about how ironic it is that I am negatively critiquing a book about plagiarism by using the same points as everyone else? Should I call this satire—granted that there is nothing humorous and that I am not particularly strongly exaggerating anything—as I amateurly write prose so unabashedly written in my own voice that it would be impossible to separate any idea from my own? Because that appears to be the direction this book has gone in.I am not the first to say that this reads like RFK\'s notes app consciousness, nor will I be the last. While I will not get into specifics, as this is an incredibly early copy of the book, I will say that anyone who even remotely knows anything about the author will see the similarities between them and...certain things. Now, I have no issue with an author writing from experience.\'Write what you know\'is both an incredibly popular and successful piece of advice given to wannabee-writers. Butfuck,at some point one has to wonder about the motivation behind it.Simply put, because there is no other way to put it, this book felt like a circle-jerk. I should have expected such a thing from a satire on the publishing industry written by a prominent figure within it. It is typical—of course they will ridicule things like social media and how the masses view them. Of course they will glower at criticisms and mock fellow authors. Is that not the purpose of satire? But this feels like so much more than that. Instead, I feel as if RFK is speaking to me in a jest. Like she is pointing toward the book community, head cocked to the side, cheekily winking in our shared knowledge of their ridiculousness. Her eyes say,look at them—look at their silliness and their worries and their jealousy. See how they behave like animals, that group of people outside of our circle.Like she\'ll laugh right after, content in her knowledge that she lives in an absurd space, and that only we understand its absurdity.My first tip-off—no, not my first, though perhaps the most obscene—is how she uses our untrustworthy protagonist. RFK is, without a doubt, excellent at writing bad people. I have never argued against this, and I rather think I never will. But in this way, I feel almost uncomfortable when her unlikable characters serve the role of real people. She mocks criticism she has received in the past for her very real, non-fictitious books, through these characters. It feels, once again, like a terrible inside joke I have been privy to. As if the reader is meant to read these and think,these ridiculous characters! To say such things as this!And yet when one is aware of the author\'s actual past, it becomes...awkward. That is, she is not an author of subtlety. The satire could not work because it was not sufficiently...anything! I did not find it funny, nor was it so exaggerated as to be comical.The writing in general did not work for me.Babel,for all of its long-winded sentences and unending paragraphs of description, felt like a declaration of loyalty to words. This book, instead, felt like it was made by someone who could not care less for such things. This is, I understand, literary fiction. RFK has gone out of her normal bubble of fantasy to try something new, and I truly commend her for it. But I must question if this is the right genre for her. She is blunt and uncouth, neither of which are particularly bad—nor do I even dislike it—but which are painfully obvious throughout this. I felt like I was reading one of those High School creative writing class exercises (something which I actually do on a daily basis) where the young, inexperienced creator feels the need to say things like ""but you\'ll never guess what happens next"" and ""this is something that\'ll come up later"" in their first point of view narrative as if the reader is not skillful enough to gradually realize such things later on. Its modernist setting equally paid a part in this. There are only so many times you can name-drop an author or celebrity or, God-be-damned, fucking Harry Potter before realizing you have written something that reads like a Buzzfeed quiz. No, the narration did not work for me, nor did I think that any of it ultimately paid off in its strange and wholly random ending I can only describe as, ""really?""I struggle to find the words to end this. I\'m afraid I have run out of other people\'s thoughts to steal as I reword them into my own. I want to clarify that I do like the author\'s other works. Out of the five books of hers I\'ve read (all of her works except for that one anthology she worked on), I\'ve really liked and sometimes loved three of them. But that doesn\'t mean I\'m not capable of thinking that this was not her best genre, nor her best work by any means. This book felt like the worst possible self-awareness. The type shared over grins and knowing smiles, wherein both parties are partaking in the mockery of a group of people they think themselves entirely separated from. This is a book that both ridicules authors while falling to its knees, proclaiming its undying devotion to them. Funny enough, I praisedBabelfor a much similar sentiment. But where in that book I enjoyed the constant switch between criticizing the power and history of words to being mesmerized over them,Yellowfacefelt more like a sledgehammer.Love me,it sayslike I love you—all of us—the sophisticated and knowledgeable professionals. Those of us who do not care for the social media mob, for we are above it. Those of us willfully scornful of such things, for if we pretend to each other long enough that we are all on the same page against the absurdist, laughable masses, we might start to believe it.arc received for an honest review'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'I give this book four stars because, one, it’s highly entertaining. For maybe the first fifty pages or so the writing felt a bit dry, though when the plot picks up, I found myself so curious to know: will this white woman who stole an Asian American woman’s work get caught?? Will she confront her own insecurities that led to this? Is Athena actually dead?? R.F. Kuang creates a selfish, self-absorbed main character in June Hayward, with a consistent voice that kept me engaged inYellowface’s story.I also think this book does open up important conversations. Yes, at times it makes its point bluntly/crudely and in an obvious way, though through this satire Kuang raises deeper questions too, such as whether anyone can remain truly ethical or generous in a brutally capitalist publishing industry. I liked how Kuang didn’t make Athena a perfect character because by doing so, she highlights how people of color can engage in problematic and oppressive practices too.So even though I didn’t agree with all of Kuang’s satirical commentary inYellowface(e.g., I think Asian Americans should be asked hard, critical questions about glorifying whiteness both in dating partners and in other areas of life), I respect that she seized a popular topic in the publishing industry and made a novel out of it. The exaggerated nature of satire doesn’t always lend itself to a deeper emotional connection with the characters or the story, though I don’t think a deep emotional connection is necessarily the point of this novel. Overall, while I don’t see this novel breaking into my top ten list at the end of this year, I found it an interesting read and one that may be fun to discuss.*also, just to add, this type of thing is still happening all the time, including in other industries. Recently I saw a white woman publish a research paper on Black and Latinx mothers and when I emailed her and asked about her research practices with these communities, she literally just ignored me. And, as I\'ve written about in at least one other review, one time I gently called in a white woman for doing her dissertation on Asian American women (with no Asian American women as coauthors) and she called me aggressive and ""untrusting."" sigh!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Who has the right to write about suffering?”Have you ever read a book that is so timely and effective in its message that you do not feel the slightest bit qualified to review it? That your thoughts on such a masterpiece are not even worthy of being put to paper, literally or figuratively, because they are trite, vapid, and banal in comparison to the quality of the text being discussed? That’s how I feel trying to put the proverbial pen to paper with my thoughts onYellowface.Is this book satire? Obviously and not quite so much. What I mean is, it’s clearly satire, but to an extent that these characters are not exact flesh and blood, but the issues discussed in this book are far from farcical. Most reviewers have noticed the central themes inYellowfacerearing their ugly head in the real world, especially in the past few years, so it is refreshing and exhilarating to read a fictional novel encompassing these issues in a way that onlyR.F. Kuangcould create.”Give me your bruises and hurts, she told us, and I will return to you a diamond.”Let’s be clear: June is not a character that you will feel empathy for. She will not be redeemed, rooted for, or endeared by the end; however, watching her downfall is oddly satisfying in a way that I cannot quite explain. The insight into the process of releasing a book with a Big Five publisher is compelling and intriguing, and it’s, sadly, easy to see how something like this story could transpire. The beauty of this tale is no one is safe from criticism; Kuang makes it clear that there are various forms of privilege that transpire across lines of race, class, gender, etc., and every single character really has something to answer for.In one word:Brilliant.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I'M CRYING, THROWING UP, RIPPING MY HAIR OUT AND THEN CRYING SOME MORE!Rebecca F.

But it doesn't happen every day that I GO MAD loving a book. That fact speaks for itself.R. F. Kuang doesn't speak with or to you when she writes, she HAUNTS you. It takes a genius to achieve that.She explored every possible aspect or every question you might have, every side you could possibly take on this subject, doesn't leave much room for the reviewer, but I'm not complaining (I like my thoughts planted)PLOT The blurb is short and easy to understand, so i don't feel the need to retell it once more (I know I would do a poor job). I saw that most reviews on here surrounded the issues of the publishing industry as the central theme of this book, but I wouldn't agree. Just like with Babel, the racial debate takes the biggest piece of the cake, just dressed in different icing. But again, I'm not complaining. The book community is rarely not problematic, let's be honest, we are witnessing whitewashing and white supremacy on here every day. So, to not be blind and ignorant, we should learn about the topic EVERY DAY. As a white woman, I wasn't offended with any of the thoughts from this book, and I quite frankly think, that hating it (the story it explores) is an act of racism.BABEL Yeah, it's not one of those 'if you like this you'll like that' situations. This book is different in every aspect, if I hadn't known I wouldn't think it was written by the same person. BUT IT'S EQUALLY AS BRILLIANT. Doesn't that really picture the talent and originality of this writer?CHARACTERS I'm quite possibly the biggest fan of morally ambiguous characters. Especially when they're well written, they amaze and intrigue me. Life is far from black and white, right? I feel like the author inserted bits and pieces of herself in each of the characters, I don't feel like she chose just one. Both are writers and artists, both flawed (chronically unoriginal), but both for sure do have redeeming qualities.Sounds a bit fake, but I genuinely think R. F. Kuang was the right person to tell this story. No matter how many times she REINVENTS herself, the story always feels like it was made just and only for her.

Di certo lo vorrebbe Rebecca Sheridan, perché a lei il ventunesimo secolo va stretto: vita frenetica, zero spazio personale e gli uomini... possibile che nessuno sappia corteggiare una ragazza?Brillante studentessa di Egittologia e appassionata lettrice di romance Regency, Rebecca ama partecipare alle rievocazioni storiche in costume e, proprio durante una di queste, accade qualcosa di inspiegabile: si ritrova sbalzata nella Londra del 1816. Superato lo shock iniziale, Rebecca realizza di avere un'occasione unica: essere la debuttante più contesa dagli scapoli dell’alta società, tra un tè e una passeggiata a Hyde Park. Mentre è alla ricerca del suo Mr Darcy, Rebecca attira però l’attenzione dell’uomo meno raccomandabile di Londra: Reedlan Knox, un corsaro dal fascino oscuro e la reputazione a dir poco scandalosa.

Qui si ritroverà a tentare di risolvere il mistero di una morte sospetta, il tutto insieme a un corsaro poco raccomandabile.Sono partita carichissima. Io amo la tematica del viaggio nel tempo, amo i romanzi storici ed ero anche curiosa di vedere come sarebbe stato sviluppato il mistero di fondo. Purtroppo già verso metà ho cominciato a perdere le speranze.Il viaggio nel tempo si basa su poco e niente. Ed è ovvio, non mi aspettavo un trattato di fisica. Ma perché andarsi a complicare la vita, inserendo una linea temporale dove tutto quello che fai nel passato influenza il futuro? Per questa storia non sarebbe stato più semplice inserire una linea del tempo “circolare”, dove tutto quello che succede è già successo? Non so, magari sono io che mi complico la vita, ma non potevo fare a meno di urlare ogni volta che la protagonista si ritrovava a conversare amabilmente con il principe reggente d’Inghilterra, COME FA QUESTO A NON INFLUENZARE MINIMAMENTE IL FUTURO??Per quanto riguarda l’ambientazione, si vede chiaramente che c’è stata una grande cura dei dettagli. L’Inghilterra della reggenza non viene esaltata e romanticizzata (almeno, non all’estremo), insomma la gente puzza e si sente. Però, secondo me, bisogna anche ricordarsi il tipo di libro e di storia in cui ci stiamo muovendo. Da un lato va bene mostrare anche i lati oscuri di questa epoca, ma secondo me almeno una scena in particolare è stata davvero eccessiva. Raccapricciante. E alla fine serve quasi solo per avvicinare i due protagonisti.A proposito dei due protagonisti, sono probabilmente la nota più dolente del libro, a parer mio. Soprattutto perché si tratta di un romance e il loro rapporto dovrebbe essere il centro di tutto.Sono due personaggi che, anche divisi l’uno dall’altra, non mi dicono niente. Lei è molto molto basic, non vi saprei dire un tratto della sua personalità. Ci viene presentata come timorosa e passiva nel presente e APPENA arriva nel passato cambia completamente. Non ho trovato una crescita graduale.Per non parlare del corsaro Reedlan. I famosi corsari rispettosi, pulitissimi, femministi, i predecessori degli studenti universitari bolognesi. E il peggio è che ce lo vogliono spacciare come personaggio “grigio”. È il personaggio più beige che io abbia mai incontrato. Tutto fumo niente arrosto, un cartonato.Mettili insieme e ottieni…il nulla! L’attrazione non è immediata, questo è vero, ma non ho capito le ragioni del loro avvicinamento. Lui già a metà parte con le dichiarazioni di amore eterno. Ma se è lo stereotipo del donnaiolo, allora rendilo tale! Mi sarebbe stato antipatico, ma almeno sarebbe stato qualcosa! E invece niente.Purtroppo non è andata bene per niente. Dovrei provare con i suoi romanzi più “easy”, perché per esempio La verità è che non ti odio abbastanza mi era piaciuto molto.

Così, un po’ per immaturità un po’ perché mi dava sicurezza, scrivevo quello che conoscevo. E intendo, scopiazzavo. Perché i classici sono classici, e quello che piace una volta piacerà anche dopo dieci volte. Mi sembra il caso di questo libro: un’accozzaglia di elementi di mille, amatissime storie diverse, tutte tagliate e cucite insieme a formare questo ibrido.La storia scivola molto velocemente, la prosa è estremamente carezzevole, ma per tutta la lettura non posso liberarmi della sensazione di “già visto”. Cinquecento pagine di “già visto”. Se non conoscete niente della letteratura classica (Jane Austen, principalmente) o del periodo Regency (come la saga dei Bridgerton) probabilmente lo troverete un capolavoro, io penso che sia molto facile fare successo sul successo già collaudato e confermato. Detto ciò, è comunque una carina lettura estiva, poco impegnativa, dai toni un po’ cringe (le Converse sotto l’abito da ballo, Taylor Swift come musica da camera) ma non la cosa peggiore che abbia mai letto.Salvo la scena dell’ospedale psichiatrico (o “manicomio” visto che di ospedaliero non ha nulla) perché è stata molto suggestiva, e anche le indagini, unica cosa davvero originale del libro. Se non fossero state intervallate da infinito smut forse me lo sarei goduta di più. Non mi capacito di come la stessa autrice possa accostare scene come quella del manicomio e Taylor Swift nel giro di qualche capitolo. Altalenante è il termine che userei per descrivere questo romanzo.Non lo consiglio ai veri appassionati dei classici storici, è un pugno in un occhio per chi desidera l’accuratezza storica e chi, come me odia le citazioni (e plagi) ai grandi romanzi solo per fare hype. Per citare un’altra brava bookstagrammer: “poteva essere, e non è stato”.ORA SPOILERAllora, il romanzo si apre con la presentazione della protagonista, la classica auto-celebrazione mascherata da autocommiserazione dove lei afferma di essere “nata nell’epoca sbagliata”. Già qui, capisco che Felicia ha visto Midnight in Paris e ha pensato di adattarlo per il suo pubblico.Tutta la dinamica per la quale Rebecca viene catapultata nel 1816 è troppo rapida per dare al lettore il tempo di crearsi una vera differenza tra la sua vita prima e dopo, ma allo stesso tempo viene prolungata per troppe pagine in un mare di fraintendimenti alla “dove mi trovo?! Cosa succede?!” che sono a dir poco noiosi, visto che il viaggio nel tempo non è certo un plot twist all’interno del romanzo. In più, si capisce che questo libro è stato creato per un pubblico che, in realtà, di letteratura classica non sa niente o meglio, ne sa abbastanza da cogliere le citazioni (a romanzi comunque già famosissimi) ma non abbastanza da sapere che nel 1816 lo stile del parlato era completamente diverso. Sono pignola? Assolutamente sì. La prima cosa che dice uno dei presunti, ricchi, altolocati e raffinati parenti del passato è “stare a stecchetto”, per forza me la prendo sul personale.Tutto il resto del romanzo è un insieme di cliché cuciti insieme, l’aspetto più interessante (e l’unico davvero originale) riguarda l’omicidio di Emily che però troppo spesso viene posto in secondo piano per dare spazio alle scene melense tra Rebecca e Reed, troppo numerose e troppo esplicite per essere credibili vista l’epoca. Questa è la prova che non è tanto interessante, per Felicia, scrivere una storia accurata quanto cavalcare l’onda dello smut gratuito, reso ancora più piacevole dal senso di proibito che suscita in questo caso.I personaggi sono tutti estremamente stereotipati, o buoni o cattivi, e generalmente questi ultimi sono sempre esplicitamente sgradevoli, persino per la loro epoca. Nello scrivere questi personaggi Kingsley si è dimenticata che uno degli aspetti che rende così enigmatiche le relazioni dell’epoca è quel costante senso di “non detto” che aleggia tra i dialoghi, invece qui è tutto chiaro e presentato come uno scambio da scuole elementari: “questo è brutto e dice cose cattive, quindi non va ascoltato, bambini. Quest’altro è bello e dice cose buone, quindi bisogna aprirgli le gambe”.La cosa che davvero salva il libro sono le scene del manicomio e l’indagine, entrambe davvero ben fatte e suggestive. Se non fossero state alternate dal sesso o dalle cringiate alla Camp Rock (Who says/I can’t wear my Converse…) avrebbero composto un romanzo molto più godibile. Finale scontato, agevolato dal fatto che anche se prevedibilissima, comunque la chimica tra Reed e Rebecca è buona (principalmente perché nessuno dei due ha dei veri difetti, solo qualche incertezza che viene smussata in pochissimo tempo).Eccessivi riferimenti alle celebrità moderne e alle storie classiche (sfiorando il plagio), una lettura piuttosto mediocre, anche se leggera e sicuramente spensierata; questo libro aveva moltissimo potenziale che è andato sfumato in virtù dell’ acchiappa-like istantaneo.

Come ha fatto a indovinare la quotidianità, i parenti, i nomi, gli affetti di una sua ipotetica ""antenata"" ? Perché doveva già esistere una Rebecca Sheridan a cui rubare l\'identità, sennò come si è ritrovata ad essere una lady con una famiglia e degli amici nella società del 1800...avrebbe dovuto essere una sconosciuta senza passato o famiglia o tantomeno titolo nobiliare per avere senso, quindi dov\'è finita la sua antenata mentre lei ne vestiva i panni? Non ha senso, non viene spiegato e né la protagonista si pone il problema...avrebbe avuto più senso se avesse viaggiato dentro al suo racconto.Gwenda è un\'altro buco di trama, la porta con sé nel 1800 senza però avendolo mai fatto o porsi il problema su come tornare indietro; cade proprio dalle nuvole quando Rebecca le chiede se sapeva come tornare indietro, sembrando pure traquilla e fiduciosa. Inizialmente viene presentata come una semplice professoressa di fisica con la passione per i romanzi regency poi improvvisamente diventa una scienziata. Giudica e condanna Rebecca per voler restare nel 1800, quando poi a sorpresa si scopre che lei stessa aveva deciso da tempo di restare (un po\' a presa per i fondelli)...insomma non é un personaggio molto piacevole o che ha molta coerenza, per non dire nessuna.🪻La protagonista incoerente;Viene descritta come una ragazza d\'altri tempi come da titolo e quando si ritrova catapultata nel 1800, per tutta la durata del suo ""viaggio"" non si lamenta mai veramente del suo soggiorno o di voler ritornare al suo presente... tanto è vero che quando dice a Reed di voler rimanere lí con lui, insiste che tanto non ha niente nel suo presente...anzi sembra anche contenta di aver trovato una famiglia quando a casa non aveva nessuno. Quindi per tutto l\'amore che aveva trovato nel 1800 e a maggior ragione per la sua passione per il passato era coerente e logico che volesse rimanerci...tuttavia una volta risolto il caso e aver trovato finalmente il modo di stare con il suo amato allo scoperto decide di voler lasciare tutto e tutti per tornare nel suo presente... perché doveva uscire dalla sua confort zone del passato già conosciuto e viversi il futuro...come se casomai già conoscesse giorno per giorno cosa sarebbe accaduto nel 1800 e non solo i fatti storici importanti.Senza senso e inaccettabile.🪻Non è vero amore;La protagonista accetta senza alcun problema di sposare un\'altro per la reputazione della sua famiglia; Non si ribella, non piange o tantomeno cerca di inventarsi un\'altro modo per stare con Reed (a differenza di quest\'ultimo )Poi ritorna al suo presente lasciandosi indietro Reed sempre senza alcun problema, nonostante si sia finalmente trovato un modo per stare insieme alla luce del sole. Reed fa qualunque cosa per passare anche solo del tempo insieme a lei in barba a tutta la società aristocratica del 1800 (tipo l\'episodio della mongolfiera) e cerca persino di farsi ammazzare quando Rebecca gli comunica la sua decisione di sposare un\'altro...insomma quando leggo romanzi rosa mi aspetto di trovarci il vero amore almeno lì, perché è questo che si fa quando si legge... si ci perde in un mondo fantastico e mi dispiace ma Rebecca non ci tiene abbastanza per essere vero amore 💔🪻La narrazione troppo veloce;Personalmente la narrazione l\'ho trovata troppo veloce, succedono mille cose nel giro di poche pagine, senza dare l\'opportunità di approfondire l\'intimità dei personaggi.Sembra quasi un riassuntoI pro d\'altro canto sono altrettanti, tra cui:💜 Reed;Corsaro dal cuore d\'oro, riesce perfettamente a far innamorare il lettore💜 La famiglia Sheridan;Nonostante sia poco approfondita l\'ho trovata ben caratterizzata💜 La suspence dell\'investigazione del caso di omicidio;💜 La coerenza storica (escludendo la coerenza storica nel parlato 😒);💜 Il viaggio nel tempo;Nonostante il grave buco di trama, la mescolanza di una ragazza moderna con gli aristocratici del 1800 è assolutamente esilarante, il ballo con le canzoni di Taylor Swift poi é stupendo💜 La copertina viola;Amo il viola è uno dei miei colori preferiti in assoluto, sono stata attirata come una lucciola solo dalla copertina...seriamente perché non si stampano più libri viola ? 😒🥺💜💜Voto 3 lunette e mezzo 🌕🌕🌕🌙'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Questo romanzo ha tutto quello che manca nei telefilm di Bridgerton: sana e crudele verità.Il lavoro fatto da Felicia con la ricostruzione storica è incredibile.

Tutto avviene come fa più comodo. Un aspetto così basilare trattato con tanta superficialità lascia un sacco di dubbi sul finale.Io ancora non ho capito se la protagonista ha fatto un viaggio nel tempo reale oppure se è entrata all’interno della storia che lei stessa stava scrivendo. Non si capisce se per viaggio nel tempo si intende passare da un slot di vita presente a uno slot di vita passata: perché quando i protagonisti si muovo tra un’epoca e l’altra ottengono una vita già precostituita in cui loro si ritrovano. Come se prendessero il posto di un loro alter ego che si trovava in quel tempo. Ma sono tutte supposizioni, perché non si capisce niente e non viene specificato niente.La parte centrale è molto carina , perché la sottotrama giallo - thriller dell’omicidio di Emily da risolvere è coinvolgente , le indagini sembrano proseguire su un filo abbastanza lineare, anche se giunti già al terzo indizio praticamente è tutto prevedibile.E dico sottotrama , perché la trama principale palese è la romance tra Rebecca e Knox. Che è pure carina nel momento in cui flirtano durante le indagini , quando ormai si dichiarano amore eterno diventa di una pesantezza assurda.L’altro elemento noiosissimo è che Knox non ha rivali: lui è perfetto e il resto degli uomini dell’800 fanno schifo. Quindi non è che ci siano dubbi, l’intento dell’autrice di creare della suspence è inutile. Fanno giri immensi ma tanto si sa che finiranno assieme.Ad un certo punto verso la fine le indagini passano completamente in sordina, tutto si concentra su Rebecca e il suo povero destino di sposare un uomo che non ama per dovere quando in realtà vorrebbe stare con Knox. Questa cosa non ha senso. Rebecca viene dal tempo presente , non dovrebbe avere inculcata la mentalità del dovere, dovrebbe fregarsene lo zero assoluto e fare quello che desidera. Potrebbe essere ripudiata dalla famiglia e disonorare tutti quanti per generazioni? Bene , Knox è ricco già di suo anche se non ha titolo e la famiglia la conosce letteralmente da meno di un mese. Problema risolto.Qualsiasi cosa facciano i protagonisti in questo libro non ci sono conseguenze. Rebecca si introduce in casa di Knox dal tetto e non c’è un’anima viva che mai una volta li abbia visti, fanno scandali uno dietro l’altro in pubblico e a nessuno importa realmente. Anzi, ancora imperterriti ci sono altri pretendenti per Rebecca.La famiglia di Rebecca sono una serie di personaggi stereotipati , forse l’unico momento in cui il suo tutore è sembrato ciò che doveva essere è stato quando l’ha ripresa sui suoi doveri matrimoniali.Coincidenze su coincidenze senza senso.Una fine frettolosissima , lei ancora dilaniata fino all’ultimo tra il rimanere nel passato o il tornare nel futuro. Spoiler: tornerà nel futuro e lascerà indietro Knox.Ora , stiamo tutti pensando che viste le inesistenti regole spazio temporali lei poteva portarsi Knox con se evitandoci questo momentino inutile e strappalacrime?Lei decide di tornare nel futuro perché il passato è già stato scritto e lei ormai lo conosce perfettamente e ha bisogno di superare le sue paure e riprendere in mano la sua vita. Quindi quando tornerà nel futuro dovrà rimboccarsi le maniche e iniziare a costruire la sua realtà passo dopo passo, dimostrerà di essere ancora la Rebecca che ha sventrato un complotto nel 1816, vero? Nada. Torna nel futuro ed è magicamente diventata una contessa, per via delle sue azioni nel passato , quindi lei si ritrova in una vita nuova dove è ricca ed ha anche delle nuove amicizie (cosa che per lei in passato era un problema perché non aveva amici stretti). Quindi è tornata nel futuro e Dio le ha fatto piovere dal cielo la vita perfetta, come vincere facile.Certo, ha compiuto dei cambiamenti nel 1816, la metà dei quali grazie a Knox, classica retorica. Ma da qui alla vita idilliaca nel futuro senza sforzi ne passa di acqua sotto i ponti.E poi la ciliegina sulla torta, ha una vita perfetta ma non sarà mai lo stesso senza Knox , giusto?Spoiler: Knox torna dal passato. E qui la confusione più totale: questo tipo si è portato dietro tutta la famiglia di Rebecca , non si capisce da quanto siano arrivati ma ognuno ha un suo lavoro , una sua vita in questo presente già costituita.Archie , il tutore di Rebecca del 1816, suo cugino, viene catapultato negli anni 2000 e sviluppa app. Un uomo dell’800 che sviluppa app. E poi , come ha fatto Knox a convincere un’intera famiglia di aristocratici a gettarsi in un portale e abbandonare la loro vita e andare nel futuro ? Neanche i cartoni animati della Disney hanno dei lieto fine così lieto fine. Perché lei adesso ha tutto : è passata dal suo passato presente ad essere orfana , sola e povera ad essere ricca, con famiglia e quasi sposata.

Purtroppo, non sono state soddisfatte. Anzi, sono stata profondamente delusa.Questo libro contiene tre generi che si intrecciano tra loro:-\u200cromance, soddisfatto ma non al livello dei libri precedenti;-\u200cmystery, abbastanza ma non pienamente;-\u200cfantasy, completamente bocciato;Partiamo dall\'ultimo, il più tragico, per arrivare al primo.FANTASY: Il trope principale di questo libro ""dovrebbe"" essere il viaggio nel tempo. Dico ""dovrebbe"" perché alla fine non lo è. È un viaggio nella storia di fantasia che Rebecca, una ragazza del XXI secolo, si è creata per sfuggire alla monotonia della sua vita. Una storia in cui lei finge di essere Lady Rebecca, una ricca debuttante del 1816 con tanto di cugino, zii, migliore amica, balli eccetera.E già nel primissimo capitolo, Rebecca finisce in questa storia. Tuttavia non ci viene data alcuna spiegazione di cosa effettivamente sia successo (viene messa in mezzo la fisica quando in realtà si tratta di pura magia). E qui arriva il bello. Gwenda, la donna con cui Rebecca ha intrapreso il viaggio, le spiega che non si trovano nella sua storia ma nella vera Londra del 1816 perché il tempo si è piegato su se stesso, per farla breve. E qui la domanda sorge spontanea: come diavolo è possibile che queste persone (cugino, zii e amica del cuore) esistano se sono il frutto della sua fantasia? Come è possibile che tutta la città la conosca se Lady Rebecca non esisteva fino a qualche attimo prima? È forse Dio e ha creato una realtà alternativa? O magari ha assunto l\'identità di una Lady Rebecca preesistente al suo arrivo (e che poi è scomparsa senza motivo)? Ma, se così fosse, come faceva a conoscere i suoi amici e familiari se, ripeto, è stata lei stessa a inventarli di sana pianta nel suo diario?Queste domande non troveranno risposta perché Rebecca, a differenza mia, non se le pone. Anzi, dopo dieci pagine, la vediamo già ambientata in questa nuova vita come se ci fosse cresciuta (conosce tutti i balli grazie a due tutorial di YouTube, certo).Ma non è tanto questo il problema.Il vero buco di trama si ripresenta a metà storia circa, quando escono fuori delle lettere che la sua migliore amica, Emily, le aveva inviato nel 1815 (quindi prima dell\'arrivo di Rebecca) e alle quali lei stessa ha risposto. Ripeto: come cavolo è possibile visto che Emily è un personaggio inventato da Rebecca che ""ha preso vita"" quando lei è arrivata nel 1816? Non ha senso.Col progredire della storia, anche se non sembra possibile, la componente fantasy peggiora sempre di più. Arriviamo quindi al finale, quando Rebecca decide insensatamente di tornare nel presente (ne riparlerò dopo) e, magia magia, ha una nuova vita. Non è più la povera Rebecca dell\'inizio, ma una ricca contessa che vive in un appartamento di lusso, con tante amiche (di cui lei conosce il nome benché non le abbia mai viste prima). Non è tanto questo il vero problema ma il fatto che, qualche giorno dopo il suo ritorno, Rebecca trova il ritratto della sua antenata: Lady Rebecca, una contessa vissuta nella Londra del 1816 (proprio come lei), che si è poi sposata ed è morta a 29 anni e che, cito testualmente, ""mi somiglia un po\' ma non sono io."" Di nuovo: cosa cavolo è successo? Aveva una sosia nascosta nell\'armadio che ha preso il suo posto non appena lei se n\'è andata? Non è dato saperlo. Mi piace pensare che Rebecca abbia un clone che ha vissuto a Londra prima del suo arrivo e dopo la sua partenza e che compare come Tata Matilda quando ce n\'è bisogno.Arriviamo al pezzo forte: oltre a lei, nel presente giungono il suo innamorato, suo cugino e i suoi ziii che, messi a conoscenza della verità, hanno deciso di raggiungerla. Ok, va bene ma il bello è che, attraversando questo portale, si viene forniti di una nuova identità, con tanto di lavoro, soldi, appartamento e Porsche inclusi. Un po\' alla Once Upon a Time, per intenderci. Anche qua tante domande e nessuna risposta. Come è possibile che un uomo del 1816 sia diventato un creatore di app? Si è mangiato una laurea in informatica mentre attraversava il portale? E di nuovo, i ricordi di tutte le persone che nel presente li conoscono sono stati modificati?Ancora una volta, sta al lettore trarre le sue conclusioni su quanto successo.MYSTERY: La trama è sicuramente intrigante e ti invoglia a continuare. Purtroppo, la risoluzione del caso non ha soddisfatto a pieno le mie aspettative perché, oltre a essere un finale abbastanza prevedibile, mi aspettavo quel ""Wow"" che però non è arrivato.ROMANCE: Storia carina, ma non al livello dei romanzi precedenti. Tutta colpa del finale che per me è un grande, grandissimo NO.Già da metà storia, si capisce che c\'è un dislivello abissale tra l\'amore che Reed prova per lei e quello che Rebecca prova per lui. Reed fa di tutto per ""rubare"" degli attimi da trascorrere insieme a lei, mentre Rebecca accetta di sposare un uomo che non ama dopo essersi opposta a questa scelta con la forza di un pulcino appena nato.Ma arriviamo al finale. Lei, proprio lei che da pagina 1 si lamenta di non aver ancora trovato l\'uomo giusto, abbandona Reed nel finale senza alcuna spiegazione logica. Uscire dalla tua comfort zone, sul serio? Non ha il minimo senso. Ha finalmente trovato una famiglia, l\'amore e tutto quello che una persona potrebbe desiderare, ma ci rinuncia volontariamente di punto in bianco per tornare in un tempo in cui, invece, non ha niente e nessuno. Perché? Mi è sembrata una grande forzatura, tanto per aggiungere quel pizzico di melodramma utile a far commuovere i lettori. A me ha solo fatto arrabbiare. Che cavolo, almeno nei romance mi aspetto che i protagonisti lottino a vicenda per restare l\'uno al fianco dell\'altra nonostante le avversità che li tengono separati (penso a Claire di Outlander che sceglie di restare nel passato perché innamorata del suo Jaime). E invece Rebecca, a un passo dal matrimonio con l\'uomo che ""ama"", fa le valigie perché ha capito che il 1816 non è l\'epoca adatta a lei. In che senso?Mi dispiace doverlo dire ma questo non è amore, né nei confronti di Reed né nei confronti della famiglia che dice tanto di amare (e poi nemmeno saluta prima di partire, vabbè). Sarò strana io a pensarla così ma quando ami qualcuno faresti il possibile e l\'impossibile per poter restare al suo fianco. Esattamente quello che fa Reed (e compagnia bella), il quale, dopo essere stato abbandonato senza motivo, abbandona a sua volta la sua famiglia e i suoi amici per raggiungere la donna che ama (io l\'avrei lasciata lì da sola, così ti impari). Va bene che uno dei due sia più innamorato rispetto all\'altro, ma non in modo così evidente. Ripeto, questo finale mi è sembrato una grande, grandissima forzatura acchiappalacrime mal riuscita.In conclusione, come già detto all\'inizio, il libro mi ha delusa perché, avendone già letti altri dell\'autrice, mi aspettavo molto, molto di più. Soprattutto da una trama che prometteva bene. In generale, ci sono stati degli aspetti che ho apprezzato (l\'accurata e indiscutibile ricerca storica, la Londra ""negativa"" del manicomio che mi ha fatto venire i brividi, particolari curiosi che ignoravo e mi hanno fatto sorridere come l\'ok) ma non sono serviti a dimenticare quelli negativi sopracitati.

Una coppia perfetta!) e una trama con un bel pò di colpi di scena, il tutto ambientato nella Londra della Reggenza.

Per pagarsi l’affitto lavora al desk della Main Library; certo, non è la vita che sogna. Piuttosto, preferirebbe tornare indietro di duecento anni e godere dei balli fasciata da abiti eleganti e corteggiata come al tempo. Forse è proprio questo il problema: sogna l’amore romantico e questo non arriva mai. Rebecca d’altronde non ha una “spiccata” vita sociale, ma un’improvvisa botta di fortuna le permette di recarsi a una rievocazione storica in costume con la vicina di casa, Gwenda. E qui accade l’impensabile…“[…] Un risucchio e un abbaglio violento quanto un riflettore sparato in faccia mi acceca, impedendomi di vedere dove vado e… Mi ritrovo stretta da due braccia solide, il viso premuto contro un torace ampio e tutto ciò che percepiscono i miei sensi è ovattato, tranne un inebriante aroma di menta e liquiriza.”Pian piano si stagliano davanti a suoi occhi figure sconosciute in abiti poco appropriati… vabbé, ma è svenuta a una festa a tema Regency, che altro aspettarsi? Invece no, Rebecca non è più l’esperta egittologa ma Lady Rebecca, circondata dal cugino Archie, dai suoi zii… già, personaggi che lei conosce bene, ma ora in carne e ossa!11 maggio 1816, ripartiamo da qui.Rebecca rientra nei panni che le appartenevano, un po’ frastornata e con “accessori” del futuro, tipo le Converse rosa. Seppur conosca a menadito le regole del Ton, trova comunque scomodo adattarsi a ciò che sembra “sorpassato” e non godere di una sana doccia rinfrescante.Tuttavia, l’odioso vicino – un certo Reedlan Knox – e la scomparsa della cara amica Emily la distraggono dall’intento di tornare al futuro finché non si fondono in un unico scopo: trovare l’assassino, e per questo solo un corsaro di dubbia reputazione protetto dal re – ma con tante conoscenze – può aiutarla. Stringono un patto, che a quanto pare prendono anche “troppo sul serio”: la connessione mentale e qualche complicazione dal lato fisico li avvicinano per poi condurli alla soluzione del caso…Sul più bello, però, carrozze si trasformano in zucche e pareti si riaprono, mettendo fine al sogno. Come sarà il loro futuro, su due dimensioni diverse?Come fa Felicia Kinglsey a non risultare mai banale? Semplice, perché nelle sue storie ci sono sempre temi attuali e importanti che meritano approfondimento, ma con la giusta leggerezza. La cosa che mi ha colpito di più è sicuramente una pecca che abbiamo tutti: non accontentarci mai. Non possiamo dire che la nostra Rebecca sia stata fortunata nella vita, per cui è chiaro che cerchi uno stimolo o un salto di qualità; e si rifugia nei libri, in storie che non potrà mai avere. Vorrebbe vivere nel periodo Regency e quando ci si trova con le scarpe e tutto inizia a notare delle differenze con il futuro. Esempio: non sarebbe bello l’indomani di un ballo ritrovarsi con il salone di casa traboccante di fiori? Ma cosa si nasconde dietro a tutto ciò? Un matrimonio di interesse – tranne qualche raro caso. E pensiamo alla figura della donna, così messa all’angolo… Quanto abbiamo lottato per ottenere dei diritti? Rebecca, nel vecchio mondo, ha tirato fuori la sé moderna, riuscendo a trovare un equilibrio… ma che non coincide appieno con libertà. La donna in qualche modo doveva essere messa a tacere, come è successo – nel caso estremo – a Emily. Felicia tratta anche il tema dell’omosessualità con molta delicatezza.Non c’è un punto del romanzo che non mi sia piaciuto o che non mi abbia fatto divertire. Ho stra-amato Rebecca e sono super affascinata da Reed. Ogni personaggio ha molto da dire, anche il più insospettabile; vedrete che colpo di scena!

Tant’è vero che, delusa dalle sue esperienze e ancora traumatizzata per la perdita dei genitori in un drammatico incidente d’auto, preferisce rifugiarsi nella scrittura, inventando per sé stessa un’esistenza privilegiata, nella quale è sia Lady Rebecca, figlia (orfana) di un marchese con nobile e antico lignaggio, sia la Sfinge, autrice di racconti del mistero, della quale, però, nessuno conosce la vera identità.Ed ecco che, in modo inaspettato quanto fantascientifico, durante ilRegency Revival, Rebecca viene catapultata nella Londra del 1816 e si ritrova a vivere proprio ciò che descrive nel suo diario. Incontra gli stessi personaggi così scrupolosamente delineati, la famiglia che si è costruita su misura per sentirsi meno sola, ma qualcosa non torna: pare che la sua migliore amica, Emily, sia fuggita con l’amante…Con l’intento di investigare su cosa è accaduto veramente ad Emily, Lady Rebecca si troverà alle prese con il suo debutto in società, dovendosi destreggiare tra balli, promenade, serate musicali, corteggiamenti indesiderati, scandali e pericolose indagini, che la condurranno a scoprire intrighi politici e a trovare l’amore.“UNA RAGAZZA D’ALTRI TEMPI”è stato un romanzo davvero piacevole, sia per la trama intrigante (un mix tra fantasy, mistery e romance, con un pizzico di occultismo) ma soprattutto per il coinvolgente stile diFelicia Kingsley.L’unico elemento che ha suscitato la mia perplessità ha riguardato il fatto che gli atteggiamenti anticonformisti e i comportamenti anacronistici (perché non conformi al tempo storico in atto) di Rebecca siano passati fin troppo inosservati e non abbiano destato il dovuto scalpore. Infine, avrei preferito che il finale fosse stato approfondito maggiormente, soprattutto per quanto concerne le modalità del “viaggio” e quelle di adattamento/integrazione nel nuovo “ruolo” dei vari personaggi.

Finita la scuola, lavoricchia nella galleria d'arte della madre, dove non entra mai nessuno: sarebbe arduo, d'altra parte, suscitare clamore intorno a opere di tendenza come le pattumiere dell'artista giapponese che vuole restare Senza Nome. Per ingannare il tempo, e nella speranza di trovare un'alternativa all'università («Ho passato tutta la vita con i miei coetanei e non mi piacciono granché»), James cerca in rete una casa nel Midwest dove coltivare in pace le sue attività preferite – la lettura e la solitudine –, ma per sua fortuna gli incauti agenti immobiliari gli riveleranno alcuni allarmanti inconvenienti della vita di provincia. Finché un giorno James entra in una chat di cuori solitari e, sotto falso nome, propone a John, il gestore della galleria che ne è un utente compulsivo, un appuntamento al buio... I puntini di sospensione sono un espediente abusato, ma in questo caso procedere oltre farebbe torto a uno dei pochi scrittori sulla scena che, come sa bene chi ha amatoQuella sera dorata, chiedono solo di essere letti. Anticipare le avventure e i pensieri di James rischierebbe di mettere in ombra la singolare grazia che pervade questo libro, e da cui ci si lascia avvolgere molto prima di riconoscere, nella sua ironia inquieta e malinconica, qualcosa che pochi sanno raccontare: l'aria del tempo.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': 'L’ARIA DEL TEMPOJames/Toby Regbo, in tutto lo splendore di Manhattan.

Non è necessario usare sempre la fiamma ossidrica in cucina.A volte basta un libro, asciutto, con la sua piacevolezza e l’odore di buona cucina.E un retrogusto di talento, di capacità di rendere semplici anche le cose difficili, di saper raccontare e trasportare con grazia insolita, di captare “l’aria del tempo”.Peter Gallagher nel ruolo del padre vanesio di James, una delle sue interpretazioni più azzeccate.Allora gli ho chiesto se anche lui era uno squalo e lui mi ha risposto di no, che lui era più un avvoltoio, lasciava che altri animali ammazzassero la preda e lui spolpava i resti.

I commenti positivi letti qui, insieme al ricordo positivo che ho diQuella sera dorata, mi hanno convinta ad iniziare la lettura, passando oltre la banalità del titolo che poi si è rivelato essere parzialmente ironico. Ho sorvolato anche sulla banalità dei genitori vagamente svampiti e un po\' superficiali nei confronti dei figli (genitori che, nei film e nei libri americani sono sempre uguali e perfettamente intercambiabili). La esile trama ricalca vagamente quella dimolto forte, incredibilmente vicinodi Safran Foer, che non mi era piaciuto affatto. Certo la differenza sostanziale e assolutamente rilevante è che questo di Cameron è un racconto aggraziato, nella forma come nel contenuto.Nel resoconto con tanto di date precise, il giovane protagonista racconta sé stesso nell\'estate che precede l\'ingresso all\'università, tra l\'Aprile e l\'Ottobre 2003, in tono pacato e senza spiritosaggini. Molte le riflessioni che condivido e in cui mi identifico; vi sono diversi passaggi poeticamente significativi, specialmente quelli ambientati a casa della nonna;ma la costruzione narrativa su un periodo di pochi mesi, quindi senza un finale e anche senza un vero inizio, non lascia spazio non dico per la formazione ma almeno per un certo sviluppo nell\'animo del protagonista: uniche due eccezioni sono un\'approssimativa presa di coscienza della propria omosessualità e una più chiara consapevolezza dell\'amore per la propria città, New York. Tra l\'inizio e la fine della narrazione non ci sono eventi significativi se non un decesso, anche questo sbrigato in poche righe.Non è un romanzo di formazione ma un racconto che fotografa la realtà, e più precisamente intende fotografare una realtà che non cambia: le persone che si discostano dal branco e dalla media non cambiano un granché, non sul breve ma nemmeno sul lungo periodo, al massimo possono imparare a camuffarsi un po\' tra la massa. E del resto anche il branco rimane sempre uguale a sé stesso. Scopo del racconto è semplicemente far conoscere al lettore un po\' più da vicino questo profilo di personaggio che parla poco, cui viene più istintivo isolarsi anziché socializzare, soggetto ad attacchi di panico, tendente a criticare cose e persone e ragionamenti più che altro per un bisogno di \'analizzare\' che però viene immancabilmente scambiato per intento polemico. E soprattutto, un profilo che di solito viene rudemente descritto dalla maggioranza come disturbato o disadattato, cui vengono riservati atteggiamenti che oscillano tra il biasimo e il compatimento senza fermata alcuna nella metà via. Il voto più esatto sarebbe tre stelle e mezza.""...avevo sempre pensato – o sperato – che gli adulti non fossero necessariamente schiavi dello stesso cieco conformismo di tanti miei coetanei. Ero sempre stato impaziente di diventare un adulto perché credevo che il mondo degli adulti fosse, be\'… adulto.

Inicialmente me encantó, llevaba pocas páginas y los diálogos de nuestro prota, James, me parecían super irónicos y divertidos. De pronto, empecé a darme cuenta de que el libro bebía demasiado de El guardián entre el centeno, que es un libro que no disfruté mucho. Principalmente porque no terminó de caerme bien Holden. Entonces esto me echo un poco para atrás, porque James, es muy Holden, quizás no tan desagradable, pero es practicamente igual. Un niño deprimido y frustrado que paga, de alguna manera, esas frustraciones con los demás.Con todo esto, no sabía muy bien que pensar del libro, y lo empezaba a mirar con otros ojos, pero conforme me iba acercando al final, caí en la cuenta de que había disfrutado el libro mucho. Me había entretenido muchísimo, y bastantes de las reflexiones sobre las convenciones sociales y lo ridículas que son la gran mayoría de ellas me parecieron super interesantes. Me gustaron mucho.El caso es que hay cositas que no me terminaron de cerrar, como que James fuera tan pesadito a veces, y tan cruel otras.

Y, por tanto, le toca buena nota.Por cierto, a los interesados en leer ""Tess, la de los d\'Urberville"", le aconsejo que cuando lea este libro y vea mencionar la novela, deje de leer y se salte un par de párrafos, porque al escritor no se le ocurre mejor idea que destripar el final de la novela de Thomas Hardy.

O quando ci si sente disturbati da un libro o da un film o dalla foresta vergine che brucia o dalle calotte polari che si ritirano. O dalla guerra in Iraq. Era uno di quei momenti in cui ti sembra di non aver mai sentito una certa parola e non riesci a credere che abbia proprio quel significato, e cominci a riflettere su come ci si è arrivati. È come il rintocco di una campana, cristallino e puro,disturbato, disturbato, disturbato,sentivo il suono vero della parola, così ho detto, come se non me ne fossi appena accorto: «Sono disturbato»- non sono solo il segno di quanto il giudizio degli altri influisca, troppo spesso in maniera negativa, molto di più della percezione che ciascuno ha di sé?Qualcuno avrà pensato che questo è un romanzo furbetto, che James ha pensieri troppo adulti, che la sua è un'intelligenza troppo arguta per un diciottenne, che la sua ironia è costruita a tavolino davanti a una tastiera, mentre io sono dell'idea che al di là della credibilità del personaggio riesca a esprimere molto bene la forma di disagio che molte persone, giovanissimi inclusi, vivono quotidianamente, e che i suoi pensieri siano troppo acuti solo nella misura in cui si pensi che un adolescente non possa avere un'autonomia di pensiero e la forza di ribellarsi, anche solo con piccoli gesti dimostrativi, a quanto gli viene imposto dalla società in cui vive o anche semplicemente alla sua famiglia.E così i piccoli battibecchi con la madre e la sorella, i confronti dialetticamente alla pari con il padre, gli scambi affettuosi con la nonna Nanette (l'unica persona con la quale ha un rapporto sincero e capace di strappargli confidenze), persino l'incontro al buio con John, il giovane afroamericano gay che gestisce la Galleria d'Arte della madre dove lavorano entrambi e gli appuntamenti scontro con la psichiatra che lo prende in cura, sono tutti piccoli segnali di quanti tasselli servano per formare il carattere di individuo o per decostruire quello che gli altri pretendono da noi, e di quanta superficialità si usi, usiamo, troppo spesso, per definire (e giudicare) le persone che ci circondano, soprattutto quelle che non riusciamo a decifrare.Delusa dal primo Cameron che avevo letto, «Quella sera dorata», un romanzo che ha l'avvio di un capolavoro per trasformarsi strada facendo in un raffinatissimo Harmony, mi riconcilio con questo autore nella speranza che anche nelle opere successive abbia saputo conservare la freschezza e l'ardore profuse in questo libro.Grazie Peter/James, questa volta mi hai fatto sorridere, riflettere, ricordare la lontana diciottenne che è in me, e anche commuovere.Ora lascio parlare James, diciottenne in transito in questa età, spesso ingrata, in attesa di trasformarsi -Avrei voluto che la Grand Central fosse una stazione di passaggio come Penn Station, così il treno avrebbe continuato il viaggio e io con lui, magari senza scendere da nessuna parte, senza arrivare mai. Avrei passato il resto della mia vita in transito, protetto dal treno, mentre questo mondo impossibile e disgraziato sfrecciava fuori dal finestrino.- in qualcosa di bello.«La luce della sera filtrava morbida attraverso gli alberi e ricadeva dentro in raggi dorati. Sentivo il rumore ritmico dell'irrigatore sul prato della casa accanto, e un'ape intrappolata che sbatteva ronzando contro il vetro e la zanzariera, insistente, come se avesse a disposizione tutto il tempo del mondo, come se prima o poi potesse trovare un buco e volare via. Ho pensato a quanto pazienti e fiduciose siano tante forme di vita inferiore, come se credessero in qualcosa al di là della comprensione umana.Sono rimasto così per quasi un'ora. Forse mi sono addormentato anch'io, ma non mi pare. Però la testa se n'è andata, mi sono scordato chi ero, dov'ero e che cos'ero. Ho mollato tutto, la rete che avevo dentro si è rovesciata e tutti i pesci disperati sono scappati via.»""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Audiobook....read by Lincoln Hoppe ...7 hours and 6 minutes.........excellent voice narration.This is my first experience with author Peter Cameron.

His family has money, an apartment in Manhattan, a part time job at his mother’s gallery, and he’s been accepted to Brown for next year (though not Harvard, Yale, or Columbia). His parents are divorced (though whose aren’t, these days?); unfortunately, his mother has just seen the end of her third marriage after a disastrous Las Vegas honeymoon. And James himself is not doing too well. The narrative voice has a kind of iciness to it, so it takes a while to understand just how sad and frightened and lonely James is; but you see him searching for old houses in the midwest. He does not want to go to college. He wants to sit in his old midwest house and read novels. And, more than anything, he wants to correct people on what they say. It’s what he spends the entire novel doing. They misuse words; they’re not precise enough. His father asks him whether he’s gay. His mother asks him whether he’s gay. He debates the nature of the question with them until, defeated, they accept a change of subject.James is gay. He deigns to tell us this on page 192, of 228. His fear of intimacy is so great that it extends even to us, the readers.However, this isn’t a novel about being gay. That may have something to do with how sad and frightened James is, but as James himself admits, he is so far from approaching another human being that his sexuality is two hundred percent theoretical. If anything, it seems symptomatic; James cannot face anything about himself.This seems to me like the kind of novel I should be ready to criticize for being whiny and emo. Yet somehow it isn’t. I want to use those words they say book critics should never use, like delicate and luminous. James’s voice is stiff and awkward enough that it never reaches that emo-whiny level; you can see the clever swagger on the surface, and you can also see the sadness lurking underneath.

""Un giorno questo dolore ti sarà utile"": una frase potente, che dice molto, ma solleva anche un sacco di domande; tutti i dolori, davvero? Quando e in che modo? Ma soprattutto, quello che mi chiedo, sempre: mi sarà utile, forse, ma anche nel senso che mi aiuterà a essere felice? O solo più consapevole? Molte volte, le due cose non riescono a combaciare davvero.La vita interiore di James è molto profonda; lui avverte i limiti della comunicazione agli altri di questo suo mondo, come se dicesse ""sento e penso troppo per metterlo dentro una parola"", eppure ho avvertito che nella comunicazione con se stesso spazia in ogni suo angolo e, inoltre, una certa convinzione che gli altri lo possano capire agisce come limite nel suo comunicare: sicuramente James è un adolescente ""diverso"", ma penso anche che molto sia dettato dal fatto che si trova a confrontarsi con una generalità definita dalla società - e che lui accetta quando parla di tutti gli altri che ""hanno la sua età"" - dove è ""normale"" non essere così fragili, così pieni di dubbi, così persi a 18 anni. Nel capitolo finale, quando dice ""Come faccio a sapere cosa vorrò nella vita? Come faccio a sapere cosa mi servirà?"", ci ho visto un po\' la presa di coscienza del ""chissà"" e non ho visto il suo andare all\'università come una sconfitta al suo sentire perché, secondo me, ha capito che può decidere se una cosa sia un mezzo e non necessariamente la meta finale; cosa gli impedisce, poi, di andare a lavorare in una biblioteca? E ha avuto coraggio, è andato oltre e ha accettato che può portare avanti i suoi ""no"" verso qualcosa che non vuole fare, ma comunque non fermarsi e nascondersi e, così, imparare. Forse è questo il senso del ""un giorno questo dolore ti sarà utile"": davanti a certi dolori, non puoi fare altro che dover prendere la decisione di comprenderli, smanettarli, conoscerli come casa tua, e, così, finisci inevitabilmente per capire e capire non vuol dire sempre ""essere felice"", ma sapere, almeno penso, come agire per esserlo nel modo migliore considerando se stessi.Penso che James, con il confronto e capendo che sì, le parole non possono essere lo specchio di ciò che si sente, ma molte persone nascondono i propri pensieri e si può scoprire di essere più simile agli altri di quanto ci si percepisca diversi, possa imparare e quindi capire perchè quello che ha fatto a John è sbagliato, che non tutto si può ridurre a una frase, un termine e a una grammatica corretta.Lo stile di scrittura che intesse la trama è incredibile perchè ti sembra di essere nella testa di James; vedi i suoi con i suoi occhi, vedi la sua psichiatra con la sua granitica convinzione che non potrà aiutarlo perchè certe cose sono così come sono e, nello stesso tempo, con la curiosità di scoprire un nuovo linguaggio per vivere.E\' interessante vedere il ruolo dei genitori, la loro difficoltà nel capire James e il cercare di fare cose concrete per aiutarlo; sua nonna, invece, lavora su un altro piano, l\'ascolto e l\'immedesimazione, il dire delle volte ""in questo non posso aiutarti"", il non fare sembrare un dramma ogni cosa - è un dramma non sapere a 18 anni cosa fare della propria vita? - e il cercare, comunque, di fare vedere un\'altra prospettiva - perchè, chissà, cosa potrà accadere e una scelta non porta necessariamente a una prigione.Quando ho terminato il libro, ho pensato ""non può finire così""; volevo una conclusione, ma poi ho sorriso: l\'umanità di ognuno di noi, i nostri pensieri, sono in continuo movimento e non c\'è conclusione, non a 18 anni comunque; l\'autore ci fa vedere un pezzo di vita, soprattutto interiore, di una persona, magari più peculiare di altre, ma che sicuramente non può concludersi con una scelta. E\' come incontrare qualcuno per strada, immaginarne la vita e poi lui gira l\'angolo, e la sua vita continua: scrivere ""e vissero tutti felici e contenti"" è solo per le fiabe, così come sarebbe dire ""ci fu solo dolore e mai redenzione"".""Poi però mi sono reso conto che, se non mi muovevo, quel terribile momento sarebbe andato avanti per sempre, e l\'unica mossa che mi è venuta in mente è stata prendere il telefono, e l\'unica parola che mi è venuta in mente è stata - pronto -""Delle volte, bisogna dire ""pronto"", anche se non lo si è; vivere non può essere programmare ogni cosa, rimanere nel proprio mondo di pensieri dove tutto ha una logica, dove ""ti conosci"", e questo perchè anche parlando con il mondo, capisci che, se non per tutte le sensazioni c\'è una espressione, è anche vero che una sensazione può non essere solo tua. E allora bisogna afferrare il telefono, anche se non si ha voglia, stringere i denti mentre si fa una conversazione che magari considererai ""inutile"" e vedere se lo sarà davvero. Se sarà ""inutile"", pace, ma non è buon motivo per chiudersi e non darsi la chance di essere felice nel modo migliore per ognuno.Più che una recensione, è una riflessione, ma non so se con questo libro si possa davvero fare diversamente.

{'rating': 5, 'content': 'YOU. ARE. THE. DEAD.Oh my God. I got the chills so many times toward the end of this book. It completely blew my mind. It managed to surpass my high expectations AND be nothing at all like I expected. Or in Newspeak ""Double Plus Good.""Let me preface this with an apology. If I sound stunningly inarticulate at times in this review, I can\'t help it. My mind is completely fried.This book is like the dystopian Lord of the Rings, with its richly developed culture and economics, not to mention a fully developed language called Newspeak, or rather more of the anti-language, whose purpose is to limit speech and understanding instead of to enhance and expand it. The world-building is so fully fleshed out and spine-tinglingly terrifying that it\'s almost as if George travelled to such a place, escaped from it, and then just wrote it all down.I read Fahrenheit 451 over ten years ago in my early teens. At the time, I remember really wanting to read 1984, although I never managed to get my hands on it. I\'m almost glad I didn\'t. Though I would not have admitted it at the time, it would have gone over my head. Or at the very least, I wouldn\'t have been able to appreciate it fully.From the start, the author manages to articulate so many of the things I have thought about but have never been able to find a way to put into words. Even in the first few chapters I found myself having to stop just to quietly consider the words of Mr Orwell.For instance, he talks about howthe act of writing itself is a type of time travel. It is communicating with the future. I write these words now, but others may not discover them for hours, weeks, or even years. For me, it is one time. For you the reader, it is an entirely different one.Just the thought that reading and writing could one day be outlawed just shivers my timbers. I related to Winston so much in that way. I would have found a way to read or write.The politics and psychology of this novel run deep. The society in the book has no written laws, but many acts are punishable by death. The slogan of the Party (War is Peace...) is entirely convoluted. Individuality is frowned upon and could lead to being labeled a traitor to the Party.I also remember always wondering why the title was 1984. I was familiar with the concept of Big Brother and wondered why that wasn\'t the name of the book. In the story, they don\'t actually know what year it is because so much of the past has been erased by the Ministry of Truth. It could very easily have been 1981. I think that makes the title more powerful. Something as simple as the year or date is unknown to these people. They have to believe it is whatever day that they are told it is. They don\'t have the right to keep track. Knowledge is powerful. Knowledge is necessary. But according to Big Brother. Ignorance is strength.1984 is written in past tense and has long paragraphs of exposition, recounting events, and explaining the society. These are usually things that distance me from a book and from the characters, but Orwell managed to keep me fully enthralled. He frequently talks in circles and ideas are often repeated but it is still intriguing, none the less. I must admit that I zoned out a bit while Winston was reading from The Book, but I was very fascinated by the culture.Sometimes it seems as though the only way to really experience a characters emotions is through first person. This is not the case with this book, as it is written in third person; yet, I never failed to be encompassed in Winston\'s feelings. George manages to ensure that the reader never feels disconnected from the events that are unfolding around them, with the exception of the beginning when Winston is just starting to become awakened. I developed a strong attachment to Winston and thrived on living inside his mind. I became a member of the Thought Police, hearing everything, feeling everything and last but not least, (what the Thought Police are not allowed to do) questioning everything.I wasn\'t expecting a love story in this book, but the relationship between Julia and Winston was truly profound. I enjoyed it even more than I would have expected and thought the moments between them were beautiful. I wasn\'t sure whether he was going to eventually betray Julia to the Party or not, but I certainly teared up often when it came to their relationship.George has an uncanny ability to get to the base of the human psyche, at times suggesting that we need to be at war for many different reasons, whether it\'s at war with ourselves or with others. That is one thing I have never understood: why humans feel the need to destroy and control each other.It seems that the main and recurring message in this book is about censorship and brainwashing. One, censorship, is limited and little exposure to ideas of the world; the other, brainwashing, is forced and too much exposure to a certain ideas. Both can be extremely dangerous.Inside the ministry of Truth, he demonstrates the dangers of censorship by showing how the Party has completely rewritten the past by forging and abolishing documents and physical evidence. We also spend quite a bit of time with Winston in the Ministry of Love, where the brainwashing takes place. Those who commit thoughtcrime are tortured until they grow to love and obey Big Brother and serve only the interests of the Party.A common theme occurred to me throughout the book, although it wasn\'t necessarily referenced consistently. The good of the many is more important than the good of the one. There are so many variables when it comes to this statement and for the most part it seems natural to say, ""Of course, the many is more important than the one"", but when inside Winston\'s head, all that I began to care about was his well-being and not if he was able to help disband or conquer the Party and Big Brother. I just wanted him to be at peace.Whether or not the good of all is more important than that of the one, I can\'t answer. I think most people feel their own happiness is more important than the rest of the world\'s, and maybe that\'s part of the problem but it\'s also human nature. I only wish we could all accept one other regardless of belief and culture and not try to force ways of life onto other people. Maybe I\'m naive for thinking that way, but so be it.I almost don\'t know what to think about this book. I\'m not even sure my brain still works, or if it ever worked right at all. This book has a way of making you think you know exactly what you believe about everything and then turning you completely upside down and making you question whether or not you believe anything at all about anything. It\'s the strangest thing. Hmmm. Doublethink? Perhaps. Perhaps not.Everything about this book is captivating. It\'s groundbreaking yet at the same time, purely classic. Ahead of its time, yet timeless. From Big Brother to the Thought Police, I was hooked and wanted to know more about it all.Basically, I think everyone should read 1984 at some point. You really have to be in the mood to work at reading it, though. But it\'s all worth it in the end. It\'s absolutely incredible and I loved it. I don\'t re-read many books but this will definitely be one of them. It is a hard read, but more importantly, it is a MUST read.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.""In ravaged post-apocalyptic future, the world has divided itself into three totalitarian superpowers: Oceania, Eurasia and Eastasia. The three superstates always in constant never ending war with each other, and relentlessly and mercilessly purging their own population to align them with their current goals. Winston works in the ‘Ministry of Truth’ every day revising, rewriting and burning history records to match the ever changing version of history dictated by their all-powerful leader, the Big Brother. Secretly though, deep in his heart Winston hates their cruel leadership, and wishes their defeat. A traitor in thought, his life would be forfeit if someone ever finds out, and there are spies everywhere…An unforgettable story about the inner strength and inherent weakness of the human spirit, struggling in the most oppressive of worlds. A book that teaches us to love and value freedom, and its costs; to cherish independent thought, and never letting go the fight. I LOVED the secret unfolding relationship with Julia, their quirkinessand even their doomed fate; and I can’t express my heartbreak and sadness for the ultimate fate of the ever cheerful and loyal Tom Parsons. Gosh! This was a such a dark and grim story, but overall, enormously invaluable.A timeless masterpiece and one of the founding pillars of dystopian fiction. A must read in life, along withFahrenheit 451andBrave New World. The holy trinity of dystopia. Highly Recommendable!After a decade or so my memory is a bit hazy but I think I found the ‘Goldstein book’ part quite tedious; hence the four stars. Everything else was just perfect, darkly perfect. I remember enjoying this one immensely back in the day. ���Animal farm’ as well, another absolute masterpiece. Boy I really need to read more Orwell one of these days!*** The movie Nineteen Eighty-Four (1984) is a fantastic adaptation, greatly capturing much of the book’s essence. Some liberties were taken of course, but overall pretty faithful to the original work. Coincidentally it was filmed in 1984! Can you believe it? Talk about brilliant perfect timing! John Hurt was spectacular, in one of his most iconic and remembered performances ever. May the good man rest in peace. Suzanna Hamilton was magnificent too; and Gregor Fisher as Parsons was totally on point., and boy did I hate O’Brien! Fortunately much of the book of Goldstein tediousness was omitted. Not a perfect film mind you, but a great adaptation.

Los tres superestados siempre uno contra otro en una constante guerra sin fin, y purgando sin descanso y sin piedad su propia población para alinearlos con sus objetivos actuales. Winston trabaja en el ‘Ministerio de la Verdad’ todos los días revisando, reescribiendo y quemando registros de historia para que se adecuen a la siempre cambiante versión de la historia dictada por su todopoderoso líder, el Gran Hermano. Aunque secretamente, en lo profundo de su corazón Winston odia su cruel liderazgo, y desea su derrota. Un traidor en pensamiento, su vida estaría perdida si alguien llegara a enterarse, y hay espías por doquier…Una inolvidable historia sobre la fuerza interna e inherente debilidad del espíritu humano, luchando en el más opresivo de los mundos. Un libro que nos enseña a amar y valorar la libertad, y sus costos; apreciar el pensamiento independiente, y nunca abandonar la lucha. AME el secreto desarrollo de la relación con Julia, su excentricidade incluso su fatídico destino; y no puedo ni expresar mi desconsuelo y tristeza por el fin último del fiel y siempre positivo Tom Parsons. ¡Dios! Esta sí que fue una historia oscura y sombría, pero por sobre todo, enormemente invaluable.Una obra maestra de todos los tiempos y uno de los pilares fundacionales de la ficción distópica. Una lectura obligada de la vida, junto aFahrenheit 451yUn Mundo Feliz. La santa trinidad de la distopía. ¡Altamente Recomendable!Después de una década o más mi memoria es algo nubosa pero creo que la parte del ‘Libro de Goldstein’ fue bastante tediosa; por eso las cuatro estrellas. Todo lo demás fue simplemente perfecto, oscuramente perfecto. Recuerdo haber disfrutado inmensamente este libro en su día. ‘Rebelión en la granja’ también, otra gigante obra maestra. ¡Creo que necesito leer más de Orwell uno de estos días!*** La película (1984) es una fantástica adaptación, capturando enormemente mucha de la esencia del libro. Algunas libertades se tomaron por supuesto, pero dentro de todo bastante fiel a la obra original. ¡Coincidentemente fue filmada en 1984! ¿Increíble no? ¡Brillante y perfecta sincronización! John Hurt estuvo espectacular, en una de sus más icónicas y recordadas actuaciones jamás. Que el buen hombre descanse en paz. Suzanna Hamilton estuvo magnífica también; y Gregor Fisher como Parsons totalmente acorde, ¡y por Dios cómo odié a O’Brien! Afortunadamente mucho del tedioso libro de Goldstein fue omitido.

Its characters lack depth, its rhetoric is sometimes didactic, its plot (well, half of it anyway) was lifted from Zumyatin’sWe, and the lengthy Goldstein treatise shoved into the middle is a flaw which alters the structure of the novel like a scar disfigures a face.But in the long run, all that does not matter, because George Orwell got it right.Orwell, a socialist who fought against Franco, watched appalled as the great Soviet experiment was reduced to a totalitarian state, a repressive force equal in evil to Fascist Italy or Nazi Germany. He came to realize that ideology in an authoritarian state is nothing but a distraction, a shiny thing made for the public to stare at. He came to realize that the point of control was more control, the point of torture was more torture, that the point of all their ""alternative facts"" was to fashion a world where people would no longer possess even a word for truth.If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face — forever.Orwell’s vision of the world is grim; too grim, some would argue, for it may deprive the faint-hearted among us of hope. But Orwell never wanted to take away hope. No, he wished to shock our hearts into resistance by showing us the authoritarian nightmare achieved: a monument of stasis, a tribute to surveillance and control.Here, in the USA, in 2017, our would-be totalitarians are a long way from stasis. Right now they’re stirring up chaos and confusion, spreading lies and then denying they spread them, hoping to gaslight us into a muddle of helplessness and inactivity. They are trying to destroy a vigorous democracy, and they know it will take much chaos and confusion to bring that democracy down. They hate us most when we march together, when we occupy senate offices and jam the congressional switchboard, when we congregate in pubs and coffee houses and share our outrage and fear, for they know that freedom thrives on solidarity and resistance, and that solidarity and resistance engender love and hope. They much prefer it when we brood in solitude, despairing and alone.Which reminds me...one of the things we shouldneverdo is brood about the enemy’s ideology (Is Steve Bannon a Fascist? A Nazi? A Stalinist?), for while we try to discern his “ideological goals,” the enemy is busy pulling on his boots, and his boots are made with hobnails, with heel irons, and equipped with toecaps of steel.Finally, it does not matter who heads up the authoritarian state: a bully boy like Mussolini, a strutting coprophiliac like Hitler, a Napoleonic pig like Stalin, or a brainless dancing bear like Trump. Whatever the current incarnation of “Big Brother” may be, the goal is always the same:A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'WAR IS PEACE.FREEDOM IS SLAVERY.IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH.Those words keep sounding in my head since I read this book. Gosh, probably the most haunting not to mention frightening book I\'ve ever read. 1984 should also be included in the horror genre.1984 describes a Utopia. Not Thomas More\'s version of Utopia, but this is one is the antithesis, i.e. Dystopia. Imagine living in a country, whose leaders apply a totalitarian system in regulating their citizen, in the most extreme ways, which make Hitler, Mao, Stalin and that old bloke inV for Vendettalook like sissies.Working, eating, drinking, sleeping, talking, thinking, procreating...in short living, all are controlled by the state. Any hint of obedience or dislike can be detected by various state apparatus such as the Thought Police, telescreen, or even your children, who will not hesitate to betray you to the authorities. Even language is modified in such ways that you cannot express yourself, since individualism is a crime.The past is controlled, rewritten into something that will strengthen the incumbent ruler. Who controls the past, controls the future. Who controls the present, controls the past. There is no real truth. The ""truth"" is what the state says it is. Black is white, 2+2=5, if the state says so.The world in 1984 is divided into three states, originated from the ashes from World War II: Oceania (British Isles, the Americas, Pacific, Australia), Eurasia (Europe & Russia), and Eastasia (the rest of it). Continuous warfare between those three (who hold similar ideologies) is required to keep the society\'s order and peace. Si vis pacem para bellum. That\'s describes the first slogan.The second slogan, freedom is slavery, means the only way to be free is by letting you lose yourself and to be integrated within the Party. That way, you\'ll be indestructible and immortal.Ignorance is strength, means the division on high, middle, low classes in society will never be changed. The middle wants to be the high and they\'ll act ""on behalf of the low"" to dethrone the high. Afterwards, a new middle class arises, all will change except the low. The high and middle make and uphold the law, the low (proletarian) is just too stupid to revolt. The state maintains its structure by torture, intimidation, violence, and brainwashing.Blimey, Orwell\'s Animal Farm is already depressing, but 1984 gives ""depression"" a new meaning, at least for me.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'In George Orwell\'s 1984, Winston Smith is an open source developer who writes his code offline because his ISP has installed packet sniffers that are regulated by the government under the Patriot Act. It\'s really for his own protection, though. From, like, terrorists and DVD pirates and stuff. Like every good American, he drinks Coca-Cola and his processed food has desensitized his palate to all but four flavors: sweet, salty-so-that-you-will-drink-more-coca-cola, sweet, and Cooler Ranch!(tm). His benevolent overlords have provided him with some war happening somewhere for some reason so that he, and the rest of the population, can be sure that the government is really in his best interests. In fact, the news always has some story about Paris Hilton or yet another white girl who has been abducted by some evil bastard who is biologically wired by 200,000 years of human evolution to fuck 12-year-olds, but is socially conditioned to be obsessed with sex, yet also to feel guilty about it. This culminates into a distorted view of sexuality, and results in rape and murder, which both make for very good news topics. This, too, is in Winston\'s best interests because, while fear is healthy, thinking *too* much about his own mortality is strictly taboo, as it may lead to something dangerously insightful, and he might lose his taste for Coca Cola and breast implants. The television also plays on his fears of the unknown by exaggerating stereotypes of minorities and homosexuals, under the guise of celebrating ""diversity"", but even these images of being ghetto-fabulous and a lisping interior designer actually exist solely to promote racism and homophobia, which also prove to be efficient distractions.For some reason, Winston gets tired of eating recycled Pop Tarts and eating happy pills and pretending to be interested in sports and manufactured news items.

On the novel front, the characters are bland and you only care about them because of the awful things they live through. As a novel all the political exposition is heavyhanded, and the message completely overrides any sense of storytelling. As an essay, the points it makes can be earthshaking. It seems everyone who has so much as gotten a parking ticket thinks he lives in a 1984-dystopia. Every administration that reaches for power, injures civil liberties or collaborates too much with media is accused of playing Big Brother. These are the successes of1984's paranoia, far outliving its original intent as a battery against where Communism was going (Orwell was a severely disappointed Marxist), and while people who compare their leaders to Big Brother are usually overreaching themselves and speak far away from Orwell's intent and vision, it is a useful catchcloth for dissent. Like so many immortalized books with a social vision,1984's actual substance is so thin that its ideologies and fear-mongering aspects can be stretched and skewed to suit the readers.

Cynical, scathing, and not without its flaws, this is still a stark, haunting glimpse at what could be.“War is peace.Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength.”Chilling.** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think. The scene that I most often think is when Winston and Julia are captured.** 2019 reread - Lost in my memory was to what extent Orwell describes and explains his nightmare.Winston Smith cautiously and surreptitiously learns about the Brotherhood led by Goldstein and then learns all too well about doublethink.More than just a cautionary political tale, Orwell has described an ideological abyss into which we must not gaze; a glimpse at authoritarianism power plays to which the Nazis and Soviets never descended. While we can appreciate the reminder to avoid authoritarianism and his prophetic vision, the idea that truth can be arranged through media is perhaps the most relevant for us today.*** 2020 rereadThis time around I focused on the human side of this iconic novel – especially the relationship between Winston and Julia. In the past I have somewhat overlooked Julia as a character and thought that Orwell had neglected to form a strong female character, however I now think that she is every bit as strong as Winston and plays a central role in Orwell’s message.Whereas Winston hates the party and wants to overturn it, Julia is much more practical and realistic in her rebellion. Winston thinks about the nature of the totalitarianism in abstract ways, Julia uses the terms of doublethink against the party and makes her frank sexuality a systematic rejection of party principle.While Orwell was forming a cautionary tale based upon his own experience in writing against authoritarian regimes like Stalin’s, Hitler’s (both actually named in the text) and by extension Moa, Mussolini and Franco, it occurs to me that the irony of Winston’s dystopia is at least to some degree focused on the party members themselves. Winston embodies the use of media as propaganda and to disseminate inaccurate statements that prop up the party. In today’s world we are already seeing this kind of abrogation of truth in favor of party purity.Every bit as timeless and relevant as it has ever been.*** 2023 reread -I think we all have had a situation similar to this: we search on the internet for something and then we start seeing advertisements related to our earlier search. That seems reasonable enough, understandable at least.What about this situation though: we have a VERBAL discussion with our spouse, alone in our kitchen, and then we start seeing advertisements about the subject of our speech.Wait a minute. OK, I’ve got an Amazon echo, they must have heard us talking.Wait a minute: heard us talking? In the “privacy” of our home? And who is they?The fear of surveillance has risen to an alarming level in the past few years and we can look back to 1948 and Orwell’s tale as one source of this anxiety.I’m in my early 50s as I write this and my generation was raised to be somewhat suspect of governmental intrusions and overreach, taught to be vigilant against totalitarianism. We lived in the time of the Soviet Union and we were taught to be mindful of surveillance and propaganda.But what if the surveillance does not come from government?What if what we were taught was itself not wholly correct or accurate?A young person recently told me that they had read 1984 in high school in the past 3-4 years so this gave me some hope about the next generation.As a press officer in the military, I had a hand, as did Winston Smith, in shaping the news and thus history. If in my little corner of history, I cropped photos, erasing some people’s involvement in an event, destroying the full accurate record of what happened, then extrapolate this ability at official omission and you can begin to see how easily can the truth be tweaked to match a desired narrative.This book is as provocative as ever, maybe more so in our strange political climate. More than anything else, this is a thought provoking novel, we are required to think critically about what Orwell states and he invites us, page after page, to think and rethink what we know and how we have been led to know it.If we “know” something is true, why do we know that? HOW do we know that truth? Like Faulkner’s Absalom! Absalom! We are asked to consider our source and to be at least a little skeptical, of everything.In this reread, I also made notice of the casual violence that creeps up into Winston’s thoughts. Was Orwell suggesting that the subrogation of Winston’s natural feelings caused an aggressive response in him? Does injustice and tyranny lead to subconscious of animosity?Orwell describes how Proles represent 85% of Oceania, we see the propaganda and party policy from the perspective of the party, of a party member who actually initiates the remaking of news and thus history. The Party makes up 15% and the inner party is only about 2%. It occurred to me that I’m a Prole, most of us are on the outside looking in. Like George Carlin said, “it’s a club, and we’re not in it.” Did the Proles care anymore? Did they pay attention to the “news” or were they more like Julia, and only played the part for the surveillance state?I’m going to buy copies of this book for the young people in my life.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I know this is a well loved classic and I definitely enjoyed some parts... but some times I found myself a bit bored :S'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I am a big fan of speculative fiction and in my literary travels I have encountered a myriad of dystopias, anti-utopias and places and societies that make one want to scream and........(with or without contemporaneous loss of bladder and other bodily functions)....Simply put, George Orwell\'s 1984 is unquestionably the most memorable andMOST DISTURBINGvision of a world gonemadutterly bat-shit psycho that I have ever experienced. Ever!!! Despite being published back in 1948, I have yet to find a more chilling, nightmarish locale than Orwell\'s iconic world ofBIG BROTHERandINGSOC. The very mention of either of those terms invokes images of Nazis and Soviet gulags in my mind. Yet Orwell\'s creation is in many ways even more insidious than these real-world bogeymen.I first read this book when I was 12 years old in 7th grade as a...get this...class reading assignment. Looking back on it, I have NO IDEA why on Earth we were reading this book at that age but I do recall we spent quite a bit of time discussing it. I wish I could recall the substance of those discussions because I can only imagine the kind of PIERCING INSIGHT that a group of hormonally challenged pre-teens thought up in regards to this book. Needless to say, I think that this is a book that is best appreciated AFTER your first pimple.Anyway, I decided to re-read this book recently as an adult in the hopes that I would be able to gain a great appreciation for this classic. Well, the book did more than that.IT ABSOLUTELY FLOORED ME. From the very first sentence,""It was a bright, cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen""to the unforgettable final sentence (which I will not give away here), this story sucked me in, beat the living shit out of me and through me out the other side a hollow, wasted wreck. I know, it doesn\'t sound very cheery, but it is a life-changing experience.I have always thought that one of the best and most important qualities of science fiction is that it frees the author to take the controversial, politically charged issues and trends of the day and create a possible future based on exaggerations of such trends and in so doing present a compelling and critical argument for change. Well NO ONE has ever done a better job than better Orwell in showing the possible nightmare (and thus potential danger) of a society without basic civil liberties and a government with complete and unchallenged control.This book is bleak, dreary, frightening, upsetting and absolutely BRILLIANT and one of my ""All Time Favorite"" novels.

In some twisted form, everything reflects the truth of reality.Of course there are exaggerations, though nothing is far from plausibility. We are controlled by our governments, and often in ways we are not consciously aware of. Advertisements, marketing campaigns and political events are all designed for us to elicit a certain response and think in a desired way.1984takes this to the extreme. Cultural brainwashing becomes the chief goal. Assimilation into a passionless (and completely ignorant) mind-set becomes the most effective means of keeping the population down. If you can make a man forget (or deny) his past then he knows of no situation better than his current state: it’s all he knows, so why would he act to change it? Subjugation becomes normality.“If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.”Big brother does this by harsh policing, excessive surveillance and language manipulation. The streets are claustrophobic and the people (the workers) can escape nothing. Every action, every word spoken, is recorded. The police are ready to grab anyone who steps remotely out of line. Controlling language is perhaps the most effective thought control method I’ve ever heard of. If language can be broken down into the absolute basics, the simplest and ordinary units, then people can only express themselves on a very minor level. They cannot think beyond their daily tasks because there are no words that connote dreams and fantasy.Step out of line and you are killed, though not before being dragged to room 101 for torture and even stronger methods of thought control. As such through the plot the book depicts a stark transformation, a transformation of man who was once willing to fight and to think but falls into one of the ingenious traps big brother sets for him to expose his criminality. Orwell’s words are frightening because of their eerie parallels with reality. He shows us that we are not so far from big brother as we may think.“We do not merely destroy our enemies; we change them.”UnlikeAnimal Farmthis also leaves much to the imagination. It’s a much more successful book and one that once it has been read, it certainly cannot be unread.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Social media is a cage full of starved rats and all of us have our heads stuck in there now, like it or not.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'misogynistic shit'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Praise the lord and pass the amunition, I am finished with this beast of a book.

This novel of anticipation, published in 1949, is striking! We follow the destinies of Winston and Julia in this universe, which is reminiscent of ours or what it could become. Of course, it is a fable, but the images strike and remain used for a long time. After reading this cult novel, we look at certain realities differently. It is a detour that is worth it, a must. Why did I wait so long to read it?'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face—for ever.’‘History stopped in 1936,’ George Orwell oncesaid tofellow authorArthur Koestler. During his time in the Spanish Civil War, Orwell observed the pervasiveness of propaganda as a pillar upholding authoritarianism, from censored newspapers to lies perpetuated for political convenience and began to fear that ‘the very concept of objective truth is fading out of the world.’ This fear presented itself across the whole of his works during his short life, culminating in his famous1984where he warns ‘who controls the past controls the future. Who controls the present controls the past.’ Published in 1949 and written as Orwell wasdying from tuberculosis, he didn’t live long to see how1984and his dire warnings against authoritarianism would have a lasting effect even to this day, often being used by all sides of the political spectrum as a cultural touchstone. And while this is mostly owing to the broad criticisms showing how any ideology can become oppressive when hungry for power, it also exemplifies his own dread that words will be twisted and quoted as cudgels to fit a desired purpose as truth is washed away. A harrowing story of dystopia, surveillance, manipulation and resistance being crushed underfoot,1984still chills today with its themes on collective vs individual identity under totalitarianism and controlling all aspects of reality to eliminate all those who step outside the boundaries of orthodoxy.‘We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.’When we read sci-fi, words like “prophetic” and “warning” often get applied.1984continues to remain relevant due to its warnings against irresponsible use of rhetoric, which almost makes the references to it amusing or ironic. Such as theApple computer commercialin 1984 that uses the novel for the sake of marketing (and what is “marketing” but a euphemism for propaganda) a product that would lead to all sorts of concerns over government surveillance for which people would quote1984in addressing them. I think the term prophetic often frames a book in a way that causes us to consider how close it came true, which seems beside the point because when we look at the ways itdidn’t, that often becomes an excuse for delegitimization or ignoring the warning.Born Eric Arthur Blair in Bengal in 1903 and passing in 1950, Orwell’s short life left a lasting legacy from his works likeAnimal Farmbeing classroom staples in the US and terms like “Orwellian” being blithely applied to anything that brushes against government use of technology and surveillance. Hardly a political cycle goes by in the US without1984coming up. In the US alone in the past decade we saw it returning to the paperback bestseller list under the Trump administration when the term “alternative facts” was being tossed around, and a few years later it was being referenced by the GOP to claim the government was denying an election victory and inventing the January 6th terrorist attack to arrest people. Though with a president making statements like “What you\'re seeing and what you\'re reading is not what\'s happening,” naturally one is reminded of Orwell writing ‘the party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command,’ and we are reminded of the power of literature and how we often turn to great works for guidance during uncertain times, though often, as Orwell warned, using it as propaganda shorn of context. Orwell did live long enough to see the novel used improperly, having to put out a statement almost immediately for those who wished to use the novel as an example against the British Labor Party. ‘My recent novel is NOT an on Socialism or on the British Labor Party (of which I am a supporter),’ he wrote, and an introduction to the book states:‘every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.’Which becomes a pretty important distinction, as Orwell believed in better form of governing yet also was suspicious of anyone who would seek out power in order to change it as he writes in the novel ‘we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it.’ I feel1984is best read with an openness to nuance and in good faith, which is often glossed over for the sake of political identifying which is, ironically or not, the exact thing he was warning against. Which is to say, call out problems even if it’s your own “side” and don’t create further divide by abusing rhetoric for the sake of scoring quick political points.I think there is a tendency when trying to score quick political points that things need to have some sort of unassailable pure aim to them.1984is critical of any regime that seeks to keep power, but narrowing it to a pointed attack against an opponent without seeing how it might apply to your own political ""team"" (US politics is so much cheering for your ""home team"" than actually hashing out politics, especially lately, though I also find the whole ""both sides"" angle to often be used less for establishing nuance than trying to delegitamize any efforts for progress too, but hell who am I to say I\'m just as bad as anyone) is more convenient. But even Orwell himself isn’t a “pure” figure, having been aninformantfor the British government delivering a list of names of people suspected of communism (the list includesJohn Steinbeckand many have observed that there is a strong presence of gay people on the list which makes many of Orwell’s rather homophobic comments seem all the more menacing). He also, asA. E. Dysonobserved in his book on Orwell, that he ‘had a very English dislike of intellectuals, supposing that anyone willing to wear such a label would be diminished or depraved.’ Which is all neither here nor there, but goes to show how one can create a narrative out of anything, and that is what1984taps into.So let’s move on to the novel and head on down to Room 101. As I said earlier,1984can be read as a culmination of a lot of his themes and ideas across his short career. Warning of totalitarianism arrives everywhere with Orwell, such asBurmese Dayswhen he describes the town as ‘a stifling, stultifying world…which every word and every thought is censored,’ not unlike1984because ‘free speech is unthinkable.’ And one can read inKeep the Aspidistra Flying, with Comstock (a name derived from Common and Stock similarly to how the terms in 1984 are often truncated phrases) bemoaning ‘I’m dead, You’re dead. We’re all dead people in a dead world,’ as a precursor to the pivotal moment when Winston and Jane declare ‘we’re dead’ right before being exposed as having been set up. For Orwell, speech and language is very key. Language itself is fallible and can be morphed to meet many purposes—it’s the medium of poets for a reason—and in1984Orwell examines how this can be used to negate truth and establish entirely fictional histories that become generally accepted as a means to upholding power.‘War is peace.Freedom is slavery.Ignorance is strength.’Winston’s job is to rewrite history to fit the purpose of the party. Within his department we find all sorts of nefarious linguistic play designed to control the masses because it is thought that ‘if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.’ We can argue that we see this notion reflected in our modern day, where books exposing history that can be seen as a blemish on the US are banned or dismissed as unpatriotic or trying to rewrite history (the irony in the latter is thick) and many have spoken on the suppression of queer books as an effort to erase the language people need to assess their own identities. What Orwell is looking at is the way language and propaganda is used to control. I enjoy the way he makes creative use of language to compile entire terminologies used by Ingsoc (the party in control that is pretty blatantly a nod to Soviet Russia) to create a propagated history that fits whatever they need, even erasing the history of entire wars to portray other countries as allies and erase the recent memory of them as enemies.‘Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.’To step outside the orthodoxy of the Party’s version of history is to become an enemy of the Party and society and find yourself “vaporized” and erased from history. ‘Orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think,’ Orwell writes, ‘Orthodoxy is unconsciousness,’ and when the truth we know conflicts with the truth of the Party, it must be edited. ‘Lies,’ writesRebecca Solnitin her bookOrwell\'s Roses, ‘the assault on language -- were the necessary foundation for all the other assaults.’ Afterall, ‘the first victim of war is truth, goes the old saying, and a perpetual war against truth undergirds all authoritarianisms.’ “Doublespeak” comes into play here, where one can hold conflicting opinions in their mind and just accept them, and the Party finds that fear is a great tool for ensuring willing erasure of truth. ‘Truth is not a statistic,’ Winston argues, claiming that just because the masses agree doesn’t make it true, though over the novel we see how the power to rewrite “truth” can potentially eviscerate anyone who says otherwise until it becomes the only known “truth.” Returning toRebecca Solnit, she observes:‘To be forced to live with the lies of the powerful is to be forced to live with your own lack of power over the narrative, which in the end can mean lack of power over anything at all. Authoritarians see truth and fact and history as a rival system they must defeat.’It is in this way the Party keeps people subservient. ‘A hierarchical society was only possible on a basis of poverty and ignorance,’ and Winston, upon reading Goldstein’s book (the book serves as an insert into the narrative that provides a LOT of exposition about the world and its structures as well as being a sort of Marxist-esque handbook, though it only offers thehowthings came to be and never thewhy, much to Winston’s interest), Winston realizes that the proles (the working class) are the possible solution. However he realized the proles can only revolt if they become conscious of their conditions and only can become conscious of their conditions if they revolt (not a far cry from Orwell’s own statement ‘we cannot win the war without introducing Socialism, nor establish Socialism without winning the war.’), and worries this may never happen. There is also the issue that a revolution will only put a new Party in power that will inevitably oppress again, just in different ways.‘The masses never revolt of their own accord, and they never revolt merely because they are oppressed. Indeed, so long as they are not permitted to have standards of comparison, they never even become aware that they are oppressed.’So without giving anything away because this book is full of surprises (though one may guess if they have readWebyYevgeny Zamyatin, which Orwell “borrows” heavily from—as does Huxley’sBrave New World—and still remains my favorite of the three), across this novel we see a spirit of resistance rise and the forces of power come to meet it with a heavy boot and the power of erasure. While much of the novel focuses on the individual versus the collective, the biggest act of betrayal comes at the end in choosing to protect oneself, the individual, and asking for the harm of others in order to enter the “protection” of the collective Party by erasing any part of oneself outside their orthodoxy.Where once was the belief ‘to die hating them, that was freedom,’ we see ‘in the face of pain there are no heroes’ and fear keeps people in line. Reminding the people of the frailty of being an individual drives them towards compliance. Yet, in another way, we see the collective existing because of the desire of individuals to protect themselves at the expense of everyone else: nobody will revolt out of fear for themselves and in doing so allows the oppression of all to continue. I think this is whatUrsula K. Le Guinis getting at when her books look at the need to integrate both the individual and collective by refusing easy binaries and hierarchies. She also, especially inThe Dispossessed: An Ambiguous Utopiaargues that history can never become stagnant and that, like Orwell argues, an revolution will try to uphold power and oppress leading to the necessity of another revolution. While Le Guin sees this as the natural course of history (the double meaning of revolution as a revolt and a constant turning cycling through) Orwell sees this as a constant erosion of truth due to the weaponization of language as propaganda that will inevitably erase reality in place of a false, collective reality where truth is sent to the grave.‘We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness.’One might find1984to be a rather bleak book, but it is also intended as a warning. There are many minor warnings building up to the larger, main point—such as the paperweight symbolizing a past now inaccessible where art could be beautiful for the sake of beauty, as well as symbolizing the frailty of the individual—and that we must take care to use language responsibly lest we hold the door for open propaganda. We can even do this on an individual level, such as not perpetuating misinformation (funny political memes are easy to share but dilute the severity of problems when we poke fun at, say, the looks or mannerisms of a politician instead of focusing on their policies) and not giving in to easy attacks instead of respecting the nuances. And so that\'s my rough rant on1984, a book that lives on for both its relevance and its political convenience and maybe we should all remember that truth is more important than winning an argument or scoring political edgy points. I fail at it too, we all do, but Orwell reminds us to do better.⅘\'A nation of warriors and fanatics, marching forward in perfect unity, all thinking the same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting, triumphing, persecuting - three hundred million people all with the same face.\''}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '1948: Europe was only starting to recover from the slaughter of World War II. Nazi Germany had been crushed by the Russian army in the East and by the Anglo-American forces in the West. The totalitarian regimes of Hitler, Mussolini and Imperial Japan were defeated. Stalin was going strong. Franco was undisturbed. However, the war was not quite over: the victors, Russia on one side, the USA on the other, were now superpowers staring stonily at each other, their hands loaded with a new and deadly arsenal.Orwell wrote1984, right afterAnimal Farm, in this ominous post/cold/perpetual-war context, and many aspects of it are steeped in the horrors of tyranny, dehumanisation and disaster. Winston Smith, the wretched protagonist, lives in an alternate history where everyone is under constant surveillance (via “telescreens” and widespread denunciation). A place where propaganda, misinformation, history re-writing, language and thought manipulation, “reality control” (2+2=5) are pervasive tools to make every individual conform with the “Ingsoc” Party’s ideology. The result is a diehard totalitarian state, a perfect hell on earth, where individuality is “vaporised” at the whim of a spectral Big Brother and where even love is impossible.Worth highlighting in the novel: the long interlude about “The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism” (II, 9) — inserted within a slightly incongruous romance episode — and the appendix on “The Principles of Newspeak” — written as if from an unknown point, far in the future, when the madness has eventually subsided. Both sections are stupefying. Yet, the last third of the book is probably one of the worst nightmares in literature: a prolonged torture and brainwashing session that plunges into utter insanity.Erich Fromm’s afterword (included at the end of the Signet Classics paperback edition) rightly puts1984in perspective with its historical context and other works of speculative fiction, likeBrave New World. Still, while Huxley’s satire is substantially ironic, almost jovial, the general tone in Orwell’s book is dismal, revolting, at times practically unbearable. At any rate, this novel has become one of the canonical landmarks of politicaldystopia. Hannah Arendt possibly read1984when writingThe Origins of Totalitarianisma couple of years after Orwell’s death. Its influence after that, on works likeThe Handmaid’s Tale, is manifest as well.Michael Radford’s heartrending film adaptation is very faithful to the novel. But my favourite film “free-adaptation” remainsBrazilby Terry Gilliam.Blade Runner, too, borrows much of its 2019 Los Angeles architecture from1984’s Miniluv pyramidal building descriptions.The days of Hitler and Stalin are long gone now. Even so, almost a century later, in a time of political paralysis and corruption, where the most prominent “doubleplusgood duckspeaker” politicians of the world make ample use of a new form ofnewspeakanddoublethink; in a time of threatened privacy and increasing digital surveillance and mindfuck, Orwell’s prophetic warning is as relevant as ever.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Update: 1984=2024.

I liked 1984 even better after a second reading (bumping it up from a 4 star to a 5 star) because I think that, given the complexity of the future created by Orwell, multiple readings may be needed to take it all in. I thought it was genius the first time and appreciated that genius even more the second time.Orwell had a daunting task: creating a future nearly half a century away from the time period in which he was writing. This future had to be its own complex, independent society, but it also had to be the natural end result of the totalitarianism Orwell witnessed in the communist and socialist regimes of World War II. That\'s part of the horror of 1984: this future is a recognizable one, even in the 21st century. It\'s easy to see how those in control can, through manipulation and propaganda, maintain that control simply for the sake of sating their own power hunger. It\'s easy to say ""no one could ever tell me what to think or what to do,"" but the Party\'s use of Big Brother, the Thought Police, the Two-Minute Hate, and Doublethink make it easy to see how a person\'s ability to think independently and discern fiction from reality can be eroded when there is no touchstone to fact. Revising and rewriting the past to make certain that Big Brother and the Party are always correct has effectively eliminated historical accuracy. How can one think and reason in a society where everything is a fabrication?Another facet of 1984 that I find fascinating is the relationship between Winston and Julia. Winston claims Julia is a ""rebel from the waist down,"" engaging in promiscuity and hedonistic indulgences forbidden by the Party. She doesn\'t care about social injustice or defining ""reality""; she only longs for what will make her feel good in the moment and only rebels far enough to get what she wants. By comparison, Winston is an intellectual rebel, constantly worrying over the issues of truth and freedom and the real, unvarnished past, but limited in how far he\'s willing to push the boundaries (until he meets Julia). Together, they make a complete rebellion--physical and mental, but apart they find themselves impotent to stand up to the Party.A cautionary tale, social commentary, and exemplary example of dystopian fiction, 1984 is one of those perfect novels that not only entertains, but forces one to think about the danger associated with giving any one person or entity too much power or control over our lives--issues well worth consideration in post-9/11 America.Cross posted atThis Insignificant Cinder'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""~ 2 stars ~TW/CW:talk of rape and homicide, physical and mental abuse / torture, misogynyThis has to be my most disappointing read of the year so far. Everything I expected, and everything I wanted never happened. I thought that the political aspect was interesting, and while I liked that part, it sadly was not enough to save this book.I’ve been wanting to read this for a while as it’s considered such a staple in dystopian, and in general literature. I’ve even watched a school play which I enjoyed, but of course, that had excluded all the problematic aspects, so I had no idea what I was getting myself into.This book takes on an authoritarianism and totalitarian government, propaganda, censorship, surveillance, etc. and I thought it dealt with that well enough, and making connections between current day and this book was an experience, i'll say that.Having known this going in, it seemed like something I would love, and it checked off many boxes of what I was looking for at the time. I even had many quotes I had highlighted for this review that I thought were insightful, but my very smart self returned the ebook without recording them all. Other than the ones I used for my reading updates of course, but most of those were ones I used to complain.But other than that aspect, it felt like a chore to read. So many things that I didn’t like, and so many things that angered me. I’m reading a story, I want to be immersed, and invested, not bored out of my mind. The writing was nothing special, and the story itself was blander than white bread.The info dumps were absolutely painful too. I don’t know how I pushed through, though barely considering it took me almost 20 days to complete. There was one particular infodump that I especially suffered through, one that would serve to bring up some of these political discussions and simultaneously throw up a bunch of world building on me. It took up more than 13% of the entire book. 13 PERCENT. My brain felt all mushy by the end, and I’m not sure I properly processed any of it. What was the reason? It couldn’t have been any less digestible.And then of course we have the characters. I would gladly fist fight Winston, who is our protagonist. I don’t care if some would consider that elder abuse, I would if I could. I have read from such unlikable characters before, but Winston is on another level of terrible. Again, must I ask, what was the reason? Why was he so absolutely horrible? He constantly sexualizes the women he “loves” in disgusting ways, and her youth, and has some weird grudge against anyone that is “pure”, whatever that means. No, sorry, he just hates women in general. Before knowing Julia, his love interest, he imagined raping her, and then slitting her throat for being, what he thought then, celabite. He contemplated smashing her head against the wall. And those weren’t solidary situations. He spends the entire book saying and thinking creepy, disgusting and irritating stuff. I hate him.And then we have Julia, the only female character that spoke more than one line. And her only role is that she is shallow and weak, existing solely for Winston and his pleasure, and his sexual fantasies. And that is all she cares about. Sex. That is all she lives for, and nothing else. She has no thoughts of her own, and her personality is as annoying as can be. It definitely plays into the whole “women are objects” thing, which of course angered me even more. I mean for goodness sake, the misogyny was so strong with this one. As in the overused trope, which in itself promotes that internalized misogyny. Julia outright says how she hates women. Excuse you?And all the other characters didn’t matter, at least to me, so that neither hurt or helped my experience, but the two we knew the most made me want to chuck the book out the window more times than I could count.And Winston and Julia together was even worse than I could ever imagine. Not only do they not have any chemistry, just a lot of possessiveness, but they are already confessing their love never having properly talked before. Winston spends a good chunk of the book hating on her, but then when she confesses her love, suddenly he is in love with her too. Winston even tells Julia about how he wanted to *coughs* murder her, and she just laughs it off as if it is something normal. If only this behavior was condemned, as it should be.This is the most unromantic relationship ever. And obviously I am aware that perhaps I should not judge the book by it’s characters, and their portrayal, as that is not what the story is truly about. That’s not what is important. But don’t you think that if I’m going to be following their story, that I should at least be able to tolerate them? At the very least. I don’t think I am being unerasable. And perhaps I could have overlooked the characters, had I actually been interested in the story itself, but I did not. Little by little, any hope I had was crushed, and I was bored to no extent, so having to deal with an incel on top of it all did not bode well forFinal Thoughts:Overall, I dragged through this. It was not a good read. This is so highly praised and I just expected better. I can see where people who like it are coming from in some way, but it was a big no for me. I’ve also been informed that this is basically just a rip off ofWeby Yevgeny Zamyatin, which is a better book, so perhaps I will pick that up in the future. Maybe i’ll even readAnimal Farmfor the sake of it, and also because I’m curious to read about talking pigs.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""i'm not making any point in particular...just that if you have any intention of reading a book about totalitarianism and apocalyptic government, written by a man who believed in democratic socialism as the solution...well, now might be a good time.----full reviewI had been meaning to read this book for a long time, but I finally did it based on a friend’s (hi Dario) insistence.

Sorry again!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'The colour of this book is grey, relentless grey: of skin, sky, food, floor, walls, mind, life itself. Added piquancy comes from general decay, drudgery, exploitation, chronic sickness, and malaise.Ten Shades of Grey?There is also sex and (non-sexual) bondage, domination, and torture.I don’t expect a dystopian book to be happy reading, but this reread was far grimmer than I remembered it, partly because I read it immediately after the lyrical beauty of another dystopia,Fahrenheit 451, reviewedHERE, and partly because I’ve probably watched Terry Gilliam’s magical film,Brazilso many times (though he claimed he had not read the book before making the film).Nevertheless, more than 50 years after it was written, 1984 is still powerful, important, and relevant - a feat EL James’ “Fifty Shades” books are unlikely to achieve. On the other hand, I gather Fifty Shades lacks page after page of heavy-handed political theory, so on that criterion, it might be ahead of 1984.“If there is hope, it lies in the proles” - they are not any shade of grey.The novel that inspired thisOrwell admitted to being heavily inspired by Yevgeny Zamyatin’sWE. The plot is very similar, but WE is a more complex combination of utopia and dystopia, and Natasha Randall\'s translation has a lyrical beauty very different from Orwell\'s much greyer, darker mood. See my reviewHERE.Have We Reached 1984? (written in 2015)In some ways, this book is very dated.•\tThe underlyingmisogynyis unchallenged (Winston “disliked nearly all women, and especially the young pretty ones… who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party” and he quickly goes from wanting to rape and murder a woman (he even tells her!) to lusting after “her youthful body desperate for him” and feeling “he had a right to” her). On the other hand, Winston is uncritical - enthusiastic even - about her promiscuity.•\tRelated to that - and to Fahrenheit 451 - Derek (Guilty of thoughtcrime) wrote in a group discussion: ""there\'s a distinct echo in both books of theGarden of Edenstory, with Eve tempting Adam to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. And in each case, it\'s a denial of the dogma that this is the original sin.""•\tA contemporary writer would probably avoid the lengthy passages ofexposition and theoryfound here (especially ~20 pages of closely typed text from Goldstein’s snappily titled “The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism”).•\tThe post-warCold Warfears are ancient history, and the rise of supposedly Islamic groups like Daesh/ISIS/ISIL pose a different sort of threat.BUT, where this is still pertinent, it’s not quite in the ways that Orwell might have expected.•\tWe’re blasé aboutubiquitous CCTVcameras, and we voluntarily, enthusiastically, surrender details of our interests, activities, location, and friends via our smartphone apps, and Google (see Vox article about how Google Trends reveals the truths that people don\'t tell researchers,here).•\tWe think we’re too smart to fall for lies like those of the Party, but a quick trawl of trending stories on social media demonstrates the untruth of that:people are gullible. The patent nonsense that people believe and share, without ever engaging the weakest of critical faculties is staggering. Most of those are trivial compared with the lies of Big Brother, but they show how easy it is to believe what everyone else believes, regardless of ample evidence to the contrary.•\tWe may not have Two Minutes’ Hate or Hate Week, but we certainly have hate figures, and again, social media exacerbates the crowd mentality: “The horrible thing… was not that one was obliged to act a part, but… that it was impossible to avoid joining in”. I’ve not read Jon Ronson’sSo You\'ve Been Publicly Shamed, but I’m familiar with many of the stories in it (if you’re not, look at the many excellent reviews on GR). Scary stuff.Update, January 2017, “Alternative Facts”On 20 January 2017, Donald Trump was inaugurated as President of the USA. He campaigned in the style of an autocratic, narcissistic demagogue. He had a long track record of flagrantly denying obvious, provable truths, even on trivial matters. The day after numerous photos and other measures showed unimpressive attendance at his inauguration, rather than blame poor weather or practical and financial difficulties of travel, Sean Spicer, White House Press Secretary flat-out denied realistic estimates, refused to take questions, and threatened to crack down on the press. The resulting furore led to Kellyanne Conway, a Trump Strategist, defended him, saying he had merely presented""Alternative Facts"".“The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command… And yet he was in the right! They were wrong and he was right. The obvious, the silly, and the true had got to be defended. Truisms are true, hold on to that! The solid world exists, its laws do not change. Stones are hard, water is wet, objects unsupported fall towards the earth\'s centre. With the feeling that he was speaking to O\'Brien, and also that he was setting forth an important axiom, he wrote: .....Freedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four. If that is granted, all else follows.”“If the Party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or that event, it never happened – that, surely, was more terrifying than mere torture and death?”“The Ministry of Peace concerns itself with war, the Ministry of Truth with lies, the Ministry of Love with torture and the Ministry of Plenty with starvation. These contradictions are not accidental, nor do they result from ordinary hypocrisy: they are deliberate exercises in doublethink.”“Being in a minority, even in a minority of one, did not make you mad. There was truth and there was untruth, and if you clung to the truth even against the whole world, you were not mad.”UnTruth and UnReality - Three Types•\t“The mutability of the past” means history is forever beingrewrittencorrected for slips, errors, misprints and misquotes, making truth unknowable (Winston is not even sure of his age or year of birth).•\tThe doublethink slogans of the Party are another deliberate type of unreality.•\tThe third confusion of reality is subtler, in stark contrast to the gritty realism of the rest of the book, and not one I’d really considered on previous readings. It relates to dreams, premonitions, hallucinations, and (in)sanity. Confusion from deprivation and torture is one thing, but there are possible magical-realist aspects. Early on, Winston dreams of meeting O’Brien “in the place where there is no darkness”; later mentions are ambiguous as to whether this is coincidence or something else. A country landscape is also familiar from a dream, and he has a muddled dream about the coral paperweight, his mother and a Jewish woman. Furthermore, there are times in prison when the interrogator’s knowledge seems too precise and secret to be inferred from spies, screens or microphones: can he read Winston’s mind?!“Reality exists in the human mind and nowhere else.”“If there is hope, it lies in the proles”“The proles were not loyal to a party or a country or an idea, they were loyal to one another… The proles had stayed human.” As unimportant drones, they have freedom denied to Party members and “were beneath suspicion”.Conditions in Airstrip One are dire, with food and basic services in very limited supply, but sanity is scarcest of all. “Stupidity was as necessary as intelligence, and as difficult to attain.”For some, “By lack of understanding they remained sane”.Three Parts•\tThe first part sets the scene of Winston’s Smith’s predictable life as an unimportant Party member in Big Brother’s terrifying regime in Airstrip One, ever at war with either Eurasia or Eastasia.•\tThe second part concerns actions: freedom, courage, love/lust, betrayal.•\tThe final part is about the consequences of those actions.Again and again, brief, apparently trivial things turn out to be significant.Newspeak“But if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought.”“Newspeak is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller every year”, with the aim of making “thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it”.This is really an extreme form of linguistic determinism (aka Sapir-Whorf hypothesis): the idea that the structure of a language can affect the cognition of those who use it. A very different extrapolation of that is in Ted Chiang\'sThe Story of Your Life(filmed for 2016 as Arrival), reviewedHERE.I thought the linguistic aspect would be something I’d especially enjoy this time, but the key features are familiar and it’s explained in an appendix (which is where most of the lengthy extracts of Goldstein’s book should have gone, imo.) However, it\'s worth noting that the appendix, written after the main story, is in conventional English.Newspeak is/was no more.For insight into 21st Century Political Language, see my review of Steven Pool\'s excellentUnspeak: How Words Become Weapons, How Weapons Become a Message, and How That Message Becomes Realityfrom 2006,HERE.Feelings – and Troublesome QuestionsThis is a grey, cold book. Even the lust and passion it contains is chilling. But it asks timeless and difficult questions about love and loyalty:•\tWould you risk everything - absolutely everything - for a few passionate meetings with someone you may not even love?•\tTo serve your ideology, would you lie, murder, steal… throw acid in a child’s face?•\tIf you could save your partner by doubling your own pain, would you? Would you really?•\tIs failure of love the only betrayal that counts? (If you tell all, but secretly love, are you loyal?)QuotesSome are so well-known, it might seem superfluous to type them here, but that’s exactly why I’ve included them.•\t“It was a bright cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen.”•\t“Although the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere.”•\t“An active man of almost paralysing stupidity.”•\t“All history was a palimpsest.”•\t“It was not by making yourself heard but by staying sane that you carried on the human heritage.”•\t“The old man’s memory was nothing but a rubbish-heap of details.”•\t“A hanging oil lamp which gave off an unclean but friendly smell.”•\t“He would buy further scraps of beautiful rubbish.” (In addition to coral in glass.)•\t“It was camouflage. If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones.”•\tA dash of lipstick and “she had become not only much prettier, but… far more feminine.”•\tCharrington, the junk shop owner had “vaguely the air of being a collector rather than a tradesman”.•\t“The end was contained in the beginning.”•\t“Our only true life was in the future.”•\t“Winston was gelatinous with fatigue… His body seemed to have not only the weakness of a jelly, but its transparency.”•\t“The best books, he [Winston] perceived, are those that tell you what you know already.” No, no, no!•\t“The blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness.”•\t“Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase in pain… Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain.” Hmm. What about emotional pain?•\t“If you want to keep a secret you must also hide it from yourself.”•\t“The confession was a formality. The torture was real.”•\t“Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood.”•\t“In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic… But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out.” Shades of Kafka’sIn the Penal Colony, reviewedHERE.Slogans•\t“War is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.”•\t“Who controls the past controls the future; who controls the present controls the past.”•\t“2 + 2 = 5” “Sometimes they are five. Sometimes they are three. Sometimes they are all of them at once.”•\t“It is not enough to obey him: you must love him.”•\t“We are interested solely in power… Power is not a means, it is an end.”•\t“Outside man there is nothing… The earth is the centre of the universe.”•\t“Big Brother is watching.”Image source:http://www.artsparx.com/images/bl_val...OLD Review from 2008The year 1984 may be long passed, but this book is more pertinent than ever: big brother is watching us, history is rewritten (though that has always been true) and free speech is constrained (albeit often under the misused guise of political correctness).It\'s a shame that the humorous TV programme ""Room 101"" and reality TV franchise ""Big Brother"" have distracted people from the seriousness of Orwell\'s message.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Yes! This book! Amazing! Terrifying, brutal, intricate, prophetic - and, in one big word, GENIUS!This was a reread - the last time I read this was over 20 years ago and I wanted to see if the 5 star rating and its standing in one of my top 3 favorite books held up - and it most certainly does.If this book was written today in the midst of the slew of dystopian novels that come out, it may not have stood out. But, this book was way ahead of its time. Written in a post WWII era where the fears of dictatorships and brutal tyranny were fresh in the minds of the people, this book plays off that fear and adds a dark vision of a potential future.This is where the genius of Orwell comes in. The book is mainly the manifesto of the Party that the main character is seeking to rebell against. But, the ideology and descriptions of this dystopian world are not presented in a boring way - they are fascinating. The fact that Orwell created this world and laid out not only a terrifying political environment, but the rules for the new language they were creating, is beyond amazing.Finally, some of the things he describes sound all too possible in our current world. The controversial elections this week in the US only added to the intensity of this book.Read this! Especially if you are a fan of modern dystopia, you must read the fore fathers - 1984 and Brave New World.And, remember - Big Brother is watching!'}]"

Ero curiosa e fiera di avere in Italia una scrittrice da milioni di copie e li ho comprati. Una volta letti, ho capito che se ne sono state vendute milioni di copie davvero, allora l’emancipazione femminile è cosa morta.Vero è che il genere rosa non mi piace in generale, ma ammetto che il più delle volte ne conseguono belle e divertenti trasposizioni cinematografiche hollywoodiane, che in caso di romanzi rosa preferisco eccezionalmente ai libri.Tornado appunto ai libri in oggetto, e presupponendo che siate già documentati sulla sinossi che non servo io a riportare, non li ho graditi.Uno stile di scrittura povero viene scambiato per “scorrevole”. I dialoghi e i pensieri dei personaggi che dovrebbero essere intorno alla trentina sono troppo elementari e sembrano quelli di adolescenti poco istruiti e superficiali. Eppure i protagonisti sono un autore acclamato di romanzi e una sceneggiatrice.Un autore di romanzi pluripremiato, laureato con due specializzazioni e una sceneggiatrice che si esprimono come due della terza media.Questa secondo me è una scelta di marketing ben precisa per assicurare la fruibilità di questi libri ai più, ad un pubblico medio rappresentato da un target con una bassa istruzione o una scarsa assertività. Non per niente è documentato che la popolazione italiana è tra quelle con il più alto tasso di analfabeti funzionali.Diverso per le traduzioni in altre lingue che più comunemente hanno stili più elementari a prescindere.Con ciò non dico che tutti noi che li abbiamo letti siamo ignoranti ma in termini di marketing queste scelte sono state sicuramente sensate, viste le vendite fatte pur non trattandosi della Divina Commedia.Per non parlare del fatto che i protagonisti sono proprio poveri nei pensieri e stereotipati in canoni inesistenti. Blake è un miscuglio tra le virtù del principe azzurro e un sex symbol bello e dannato. Passa la vita ad atteggiarsi a cattivo ragazzo e sciupa femmine ma grazie alla scemotta ingenua si accasa per rivelare a tutti che è un eroe.Summer, la scemotta di turno, nonostante non abbia i canoni estetici desiderati da Blake, lo fa innamorare e con lui si scopre essere una ninfomane appagandolo più delle altre sebbene queste fossero più esperte. Ma guarda un po’… qualcuno crede davvero a queste scemenze?Ok, a parole non ci crede nessuno ma nei fatti in questi testi vengono propinate tutte le scemenze che per anni hanno illuso generazioni di ragazzine che si sottomettono al bello di turno. Quelle che perdono tempo pensando che i tipi che vanno con “quelle altre” sotto sotto possano cambiare, o peggio che sotto sotto siano diversi da come sembrano. Donne che tuttora pensano che loro potrebbero costituire motivo di cambiamento. O ancora, qui si propina lo stereotipo di uomo che se se la tira allora è figo. Ma insomma, veramente noi donne stiamo ancora a questo?Quando cominceremo a dire che se una persona è arrogante ed egocentrica, o ci schernisce, bisogna ostracizzarla e non raccontargli i fatti nostri e persino andarci a letto?Domande retoriche.No, non li ho apprezzati e li ho messi in vendita come usato.Li sconsiglio, anche alle ragazze stolte perché potrebbero avere difficoltà a distinguere l’ “emo-fantasy” dal realismo e cancellare del tutto la saggezza che la donna ha acquisito negli ultimi secoli.⭐️⭐️👀Se hai apprezzato questa recensione puoi seguirmi su IG e Threads per trovarne tante altre e parlarne insieme:🔗https://www.instagram.com/miaolibroE se vuoi sostenere la mia passione puoi regalarmi un libro dalla mia lista Amazon:🔗https://short-link.me/amazonmiaolibroGrazie infinite ♥️'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Una novella carina sulla storia di Blake Avery, ho apprezzato il pretesto della psicoterapia per rendere la storia più fluida e con maggiore coesione piuttosto della semplice suddivisione in storie separate l’una dall’altra.Tuttavia, a parere personale sono un po’ annoiata da questi libri su Blake e Summer.

È letteralmente fuori di testa, sregolato e scavezzacollo, poco incline a seguire le regole, eccetto le sue. Il problema è che lui di regole non ne ha.Ho dedotto che nei libri precedenti incontra e si scontra con Summer, che diventerà la sua compagna, ma non prima di aver affrontato qualche “problemino” di coppia.In questo romanzo troviamo un Blake ancora ignaro dell’esistenza di Summer, e che si racconta, o meglio viene analizzato. Infatti, questa sorta di biografia viene raccontata attraverso le sedute di psicoanalisi a cui Blake è costretto a partecipare.Blake è uno scrittore newyorkese, vende milioni di copie ed è sempre in testa alle classifiche. Il problema è il suo carattere che mette a dura prova tutti i suoi collaboratori, tanto che la sua casa editrice lo costringe a incontrare il dottor Zuckerman, vero idolo di tutta la storia, che riesce a tener testa a un Blake poco incline a raccontarsi ma che lo farà suo malgrado, anche con una buona dose di simpatia.Incontro dopo incontro, il nostro protagonista si mette a nudo e racconta la sua vita, le sue prime volte, fino a giungere alla conoscenza di Summer.Felicia Kingsley si è affermata come una delle autrici più amate nel panorama del romance contemporaneo italiano. Il suo stile di scrittura, caratterizzato da una serie di peculiarità, ha conquistato il cuore di migliaia di lettori.La sua ultima fatica è un vero gioiello che cattura il lettore fin dalle prime pagine. La storia è deliziosa, passionale e divertente, proprio come i suoi protagonisti.La sua scrittura è ricca di quell’ironia che rende la lettura piacevole e scorrevole. I personaggi sono caratterizzati in modo perfetto, con personalità ben definite e sfaccettature che li rendono realistici e coinvolgenti. La trama è avvincente e tiene il lettore incollato fino all’ultima pagina.Anche i cliché del genere, che sono inevitabili in questo tipo di romanzi, vengono utilizzati dalla Kingsley in modo intelligente e brillante, evitando di cadere nella banalità. L’autrice ha la capacità di toccare le corde del cuore del lettore, trasmettendo emozioni intense e sincere.L’unico rammarico è quello di averla scoperta solo ora, ma la consolazione è che avrò tanti altri suoi libri da recuperare.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '«Nel caso avessi di nuovo problemi di disciplina e volessi riguardare il tuo percorso. Zucky».Questa è la dedica presente all’interno di un taccuino nero, contenente gli appunti del dottor Zuckerman, uno psicoterapista a cui Blake Avery è stato costretto a rivolgersi dalla sua ex moglie/agente, a causa della sua vita sregolata e della sua incapacità a tener fede agli impegni presi.Si tratta dello stesso Blake già incontrato in“Due cuori in affitto”, del quale“LO SPEZZACUORI”è il prequel. Già il titolo è un programma: il famoso scrittore di best seller, infatti, seguendo con costanza il suo percorso terapeutico, si apre e racconta tutti gli episodi salienti della sua vita che, di fatto, si identificano con una ragguardevole serie di conquiste amorose. Nessuna donna resiste al suo charme e tutte, prima o poi, cadono ai suoi piedi. Ma tutto sommato, Blake ha anche un lato serio, corretto e profondo, per dirla con le sue parole:«Non penso di essere una persona così bella, ma almeno provo a non fare schifo».In questo romanzoFelicia Kingsleysi distacca dal solito target, mantenendo però il suo stile frizzante, ricco di ironia, che espone con apparente leggerezza temi importanti (in questo caso l’importanza di chiedere aiuto ad uno specialista in caso di disagio psicologico).Devo ammettere che non mi ha entusiasmato, in realtà ho preferito altre sue pubblicazioni, però ho apprezzato (perché l’ho trovato divertente) il rapporto che si instaura tra Avery e Zuckerman e, in particolare, la sardonica sagacia di quest’ultimo.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Semplicemente stupendo, come tutti gli altri d'altronde.Questo però è allo stesso tempo diverso: infondo è interamente incentrato su un solo personaggio, che racconta gli eventi della sua vita, lasciandosi scoprire dal dottore. Leggendolo ho scoperto anche io parte del suo essere ed anche di me stessa, perché l'ho preso come uno spunto per riflettere sulla mia vita e sul mio passato, sul fatto che senza accorgermene molti eventi e/o incontri mi abbiano condizionato e mi abbiano portato ad essere che sono per ora.Un capolavoro che fa riflettere ma anche divertire, per chi ormai conosce il personaggio e se n'è innamorato dalla sua prima comparsa.Un libro che si fa leggere tutto in un fiato, come tutti i libri di Felicia. L'ho amato!!""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Con sagacia ed ironia, Felicia Kingsley ci riporta nell'universo di Blake Avery facendoci sfogliare il suo passato e le sue esperienze. Si scoprono nuove sfaccettature di Blake, i suoi sentimenti e le sue opinioni ma è la sua intelligenza, da sempre inattaccabile e che lo contraddistingue, a rendere il tutto ancora più piacevole da leggere.Il dottor Zucky lo controbilancia alla perfezione.3.5 stelline!Al prossimo romanzo di Felicia!!""}]"

The Song of Achilles
",Madeline Miller,4.32,1673365,2994,"Fantasy, Historical Fiction, Romance, Fiction, Mythology, LGBT, Queer",408,20-09-2011,"Alternate cover edition ofISBN 9780062060624.Achilles, ""the best of all the Greeks,"" son of the cruel sea goddess Thetis and the legendary king Peleus, is strong, swift, and beautiful, irresistible to all who meet him. Patroclus is an awkward young prince, exiled from his homeland after an act of shocking violence. Brought together by chance, they forge an inseparable bond, despite risking the gods' wrath.They are trained by the centaur Chiron in the arts of war and medicine, but when word comes that Helen of Sparta has been kidnapped, all the heroes of Greece are called upon to lay siege to Troy in her name. Seduced by the promise of a glorious destiny, Achilles joins their cause, and torn between love and fear for his friend, Patroclus follows. Little do they know that the cruel Fates will test them both as never before and demand a terrible sacrifice.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': ""”We were like gods, at the dawning of the world, and our joy was so bright we could see nothing else but the other.”This book!!!Gosh I loved this book!!!The moment I read the first page I was already certain of two things:1.)\tThis would become one of my all-time favourites and I’d gush about it like crazy.2.)\tIt wouldn’t only leave me devastated and heartbroken but also sobbing like a little child.Well, both of those things came true, even way earlier than I had initially anticipated. I was about 37% percent in (yes I looked it up! ;-P) when I first started to cry and it didn’t get any better after that. This book was just so beautiful!So, so damn beautiful!Madeline Miller definitely has a way with words and I loved how this story was written: Poetical with a lot of mythological facts and with so many details that it succeeded to make this a more than just intriguing journey.What I loved the most was how she managed to convey Achilles’ and Patroclus relationship though. Even though she never went into detail, never actually let them say that they loved each other; it was still palpable in every single moment they shared together. Those moments were so precious I couldn’t get enough of them and all I wanted was for them to be happy.Unfortunately I’m a little geek and know a lot about Greek mythology so yeah, I already knew how it would end before it even ended. Still, the sense of foreboding in this book!!! Oh gosh, it killed me!! All those little hints, those infinitesimal innuendos, those tiny insinuations, they piled up and up and up until all I was able to feel was dread!!! By the end of the book I was reduced to a sobbing and crying nervous wreck and the final sentence was like a dagger in my heart.In other words:This was exceptionally painful and utterly devastating,BUTit was also so damn good and worth every second of pain!The characters:This is my spoiler section in which I’m going to speak about the individual characters and what I thought of them. So you better beware and don’t read it if you still want to read the book. Heed my warning or get lost in the underworld. It’s your choice, choose wisely! ;-PAchilles:’Ah.’ A sly smile spread across his face; he had always loved defiance. ‘Well, why should I kill him? He’s done nothing to me.’This sentence killed me when I first read it! Achilles, my beautiful, innocent and naïve boy!!! Jeez! I loved him so much! He was every bit the hero people believed him to be and most of the time he actually did the right thing. Well, most of the time. At the end of the book there happened a lot of things I didn’t agree with and the longer his conflict with Agamemnon lasted the more I dreaded the end! It made me so sad to see how much Achilles changed over the years and when the thing with Briseis happened my reaction was the same as Patroclus’! I mean I knew what Achilles did (I’m a geek remember?) but reading it the way Madeline Miller wrote it? Boy it destroyed me! There was this wonderful, perfect, righteous, honourable, intelligent, innocent and honest golden boy and then the war over Troy tainted him, transformed him and made him an entirely different person. The true tragedy about this all is that he never even wanted to take part in the war, he was more or less forced into it and I think looking at it in retrospective a life as a normal person would have been preferable to the one of a hero. I guess in the end Achilles saw it the same way and would have done everything in order to change his path. Even if it would have meant that he would have been forgotten and would have never become a legend… it would have been worth it.Patroclus would have been worth it…*cries*”I stopped watching for ridicule, the scorpion’s tail hidden in his words. He said what he meant; he was puzzled if you did not. Some people might have mistaken this for simplicity. But is it not a sort of genius to cut always to the heart?””Your honour could be darkened by it.”“Then it is darkened.” His jaw shot forward, stubborn. “They are fools if they let my glory rise or fall on this.”“But Odysseus –“His eyes, green as spring leaves, met mine. “Patroclus. I have given enough to them. I will not give them this.””They grinned, loving every inch of their miraculous prince: his gleaming hair, his deadly hands, his nimble feet. They leaned towards him, like flowers to the sun, drinking in his lustre. It was as Odysseus had said: he had light enough to make heroes of them all.””It is not true. You left yourself today. And now you are returned.”His shoulders rise and fall on a long breath. “Do not say that,” he says, “until you have heard the rest of what I have done.”Patroclus:”I went to Peleus. I knelt before him on a wool rug, woven bright with purple. He started to speak, but I was too quick for him. One of my hands went to clasp his knees, the other reached upward, to seize his chin with my hand. The pose of supplication. It was a gesture I had seen many times, but had never made myself. I was under his protection now; he was bound to treat me fairly, by the law of the gods.‘Tell me where he is,’ I said.”I adored Patroclus! He was the best! He was wonderful and beautiful in his own way and I loved how faithful he was. That boy was one of the kindest and sweetest people I ever read about (tough competition for Lazlo Strange *lol*) and I was so happy Achilles saw this too. He realized that Patroclus is special and he encouraged him to speak his mind. It felt like Patroclus was Achilles’ conscience, intervening whenever his divine heritage showed. Without Patroclus Achilles path would have been dark and bloody but with him at his side he became the glorious figure we all know about. Patroclus was so much more than just a companion. He was a friend, a lover, a teacher, a conscience, a reminder and Achilles past, present and future! This boy was literally the embodiment of Achilles life and actions and the people around them were fools for not seeing their strong connection. Patroclus was everything that was good about Achilles, he brought out the best in him. Taught him compassion and love, he was an anchor and someone he could come home to! Speak to! Confide in! Once Patroclus was gone the relentless godly part of Achilles showed though and the rest of it is (bloody) history. T_T’Patroclus.’ It was the name my father had given me, hopefully but injudiciously, at my birth, and it tasted of bitterness on my tongue. ‘Honour of the father,’ it meant.”Perhaps she thought I was mocking her, flourishing my triumph. Perhaps she thought I hated her. She did not know that I almost asked him, a hundred times, to be a little kinder to her. You do not have to humiliate her so thoroughly, I thought. But it was not kindness he lacked, it was interest. His gaze passed over her as if she were not here.”’Willl you come with me?’ he asked.The never-ending ache of love and sorrow. Perhaps in some other life I could have refused, could have torn my hair and screamed, and made him face his choice alone. But not in this one. He would sail to Troy and I would follow, even into death.Yes, I whispered. Yes.”I do not know this man, I think. He is no one I have ever seen before. My rage towards him is hot as blood. I will never forgive him. I imagine tearing down our tent, smashing the lyre, stabbing myself in the stomach and bleeding to death. I want to see his face broken with grief and regret. I want to shatter the cold mask of stone that has slipped down over the boy I knew. He has given her to Agamemnon knowing what will happen.”Odysseus:”May I give you some advice? If you are truly his friend you will help him leave his soft heart behind. He’s going to Troy to kill men, not rescue them.” His dark eyes held me like swift-running current. “He is a weapon, a killer. Do not forget it. You can use a spear as a walking stick, but that will not change its nature.”Damn, how much I hated and liked that sneaky and cunning bastard!! I’m still very torn when it comes to him. On the one hand he gave sound advice and knew exactly what he did and on the other hand he forced Achilles on his destined path. If it wouldn’t have been for Odysseus he would have never gone to Troy and even though I agree with his sentiment that Achilles could save them all, I still disagree with the way he played him. Of all the countless men that manipulated young Achilles, Odysseus probably was the worst, hiding behind the mask of a friend but ultimately pursuing his own goals. Clever! Very clever indeed!Agamemnon:”Then you are a traitor to this army, and will be punished like one. Your war prizes are hostage, placed in my care until you offer your obedience and submission. Let us start with that girl. Briseis, is her name? She will do as a penance for the girl you have forced me to return.”I HATE AGAMEMNON!!!Fiercely!!! Such an unfair and dishonourable numpty!!! I hate him and all his actions! I mean what kind of father would trade his daughter away and then kill her?! His own flesh and blood! Gosh, I CAN’T EVEN WITH HIM!! I’m still so angry! Those moments at the end and the tense situation between Achilles and him had me at the edge of my seat and all I wanted to do was to scream at the injustice that took place in front of me!!! Such a stubborn and self-righteous fool!! He should have listened to Achilles but he was too proud to. *shakes head in disbelief* I. HATE. HIM!!! Enough said!Thetis:Another person that landed on my shit list! *lol* I really, really disliked her too! I mean I understand that she was Achilles mother and only wanted the best for her son, but it was more than just obvious that the best was Patroclus and I hated her for always trying to drive a wedge between them! Without Thetis half of their troubles wouldn’t have even existed and even though she kind of redeemed herself in the end I still don’t like her! Sorry Thet, but you’ll never get a thumbs-up from me! #SorryNotSorrryThe relationship:Achilles & Patroclus:”This morning he had leaped on to my bed and pressed his nose against mine. ‘Good morning,’ he’d said. I remembered the heat of him against my skin.”Ohh how sweet those two were! I loved their relationship! They were so gentle and adorable and no matter what happened and no matter how many obstacles were in their way they always managed to find back to each other! They had confidence in each other and they supported each other regardless of the consequences. Achilles and Patroclus had such an honest and beautiful relationship,I CAN’T EVEN!!!!THIS was the real deal!!! A connection so deep that no one could destroy it, a love so strong that it cast aside all obstacles, their trust so deep that they could talk about everything!!! Boy, I could gush about this relationship at eye level for eternity and still would never get tired of it! *lol* I just adore them so much! It was so sweet they couldn’t even be angry with each other and even though Patroclus wasn’t always happy with Achilles decisions, he still did his best to support him as best as he could, even if that meant that he had to go against his will. I think in the end their unconditional love for each other was the only thing that was able to break them and it eventually did. Jeez! How it did! *cries again* Achilles had no reason to kill Hector, no reason to fulfil the prophecy. Well, at least not until Hector took the only thing that mattered to him, the only thing he didn’t want to live without. Patroclus! *sobs* Hell! The way Achilles grieved!!! It broke my freaking heart!!! It was like a punch in the gut! I know first-hand how much this hurts, how painful it is to lose a person you love so much, and boy did it trigger my emotions. T_T I felt Achilles grief with him and it was so intense it left me crying and sobbing. They were so beautiful together… so, so, so damn beautiful. I can’t anymore… *weeps*”I saw then how I had changed. I did not mind any more, that I lost when we raced and I lost when we swam out to the rocks and I lost when we tossed spears or skipped stones. For who can be ashamed to lose to such beauty? It was enough to watch him win, to see the soles of his feet flashing as they kicked up sand, or the rise and fall of his shoulders as he pulled through the salt. It was enough.””My pulse jumps, for no reason I can name. He has looked at me a thousand times, but there is something different in this gaze, an intensity I do not know. My mouth is dry, and I can hear the sound of my throat as I swallow.He watches me. It seems that he is waiting.””His eyes were unwavering, green flecked with gold. A certainty rose in me, lodged in my throat. I will never leave him. It will be this, always, for as long as he will let me.””Had she really thought I would not know him? I could recognize him by touch alone, by smell, I would know him blind, by the way his breaths came and his feet struck the earth. I would know him in death, at the end of the world.””You can’t.” He was sitting up now, leaning forward.“I can’t.”“I know. They never let you be famous and happy.” He lifted an eyebrow. “I’ll tell you a secret.”“Tell me.” I loved it when he was like this.“I’m going to be the first.” He took my palm and held it to him. “Swear it.”“Why me?”“Because you’re the reason. Swear it.”“I swear it,” I said, lost in the high colour of his cheeks, the flame in his eyes.“I swear it,” he echoed.”There was more to say, but for once we did not say it. There would be other times for speaking, tonight and tomorrow and all the days after that. He let go of my hand.”All told this was one of the most beautiful books I’ve ever read. It caused me to cry, it made me angry, it made me smile and it touched me deeply. I’m a total mess after reading this and my emotions are still all over the place, to say I regret reading it would be one hell of a lie though.I rarely write this into my reviews but: If you haven’t read this, do it now!!! You won’t regret it! =)Last but not least I want to thank mySweet Sugar Bunwho dared to buddy read this book with me! Thank you for all the comments, messages and updates that made it bearable to read this book.

Again and again I saw his wrist twist, exposing its pale underside, those flute-like bones thrusting elegantly forward. My spear sagged forgotten to the ground as I watched. I could not even see the ugliness of the deaths anymore, the brains, the shattered bones that later I would wash from my skin and hair. All I saw was his beauty, his singing limbs, the quick flickering of his feet.”Madeline Miller studied Latin and Ancient Greek from Brown University and even more interestingly studied at the Yale School of Drama, specializing in adapting classical tales for a modern audience. I ignored this book when it first came out because I had readThe Iliadtwice and plan to read it many more times if the Gods grant me enough time to do so. A reimagining of Homer’s words? There is enough debate over translations of the original source documentation without adding in additional controversy over Miller’s interpretation of events.Or so I thought.After all, aren’t these books designed for a “modern audience” who will never even attempt to read Homer? I am not the target audience, as there is very little modern about me. I have ancient book dust permanently lodged in my lungs. I cough, and the air is redolent with the scent of decaying leather and the intoxicating smell of the slightly hallucinatory book fungi. Miller is doing good work, though, bringing Homer to life for a new generation. Her books are not for me.Or so I thought.When her bookGalateacame out, I barely even flinched. A mild flickering of interest, but I was up to my eyeballs in books to read so I easily dissuaded myself from giving it much thought. Deciding to readGalateawould also mean that I would need to readSong of Achillesfirst because I do believe that books by serious authors build upon one another. I wasn’t taking Miller serious...yet. Part of my resistance came from the fact that I’m not a big fan of Achilles. He might have been”The Greatest Warrior of his Generation,”but I didn’t find him very heroic. Now Hector, poor doomed Hector, to me he was the hero ofThe Iliad. I didn’t really want to read a book glorifying Achilles and how effortless it was for him to kill a hundred Trojans in one lazy, bloody afternoon.Or so I thought.The lovely and talented Madeline Miller.I fully expected Miller to fade back into the woodwork of academia, but then this year she publishedCirce. With one raised Nadalesque eyebrow, I thought to myself, now Circe is someone I don’t know nearly enough about. The five star reviews started raining down on me like thunderbolts from the fingers of Zeus. Cupid shot a quiver full of arrows at me, piercing me in numerous appendages until I looked like Saint Sebastian. If I could have gotten my hands on that pink tinted, chubby, precocious toddler, I’d have turned him over my knee and paddled him with his own bow. Really, I must confess that my new found love for Achilles, Patroclus, Briseis, Chiron, Odysseus, and even Madeline Miller herself could be the result of those love poison tipped arrows. Regardless, does it matter the reason why?Even in an addled state, there is no way I would ever confuse great writing for poorly conceived writing. As I was reading through my notes and savoring favorite passages again, now that Cupid’s fog has cleared from my mind, I must say Miller is a wonderful, lyrical writer.It all begins with a rape. The Greek Gods want to reward Peleus for being such a good subject and decide that he should be given a sea nymph named Thetis as his bride.”It was considered their highest honor. After all, what mortal would not want to bed a goddess and sire a son from her? Divine blood purified our muddy race, bred heroes from dust and clay. And this goddess brought a greater promise still: the Fates had foretold that her son would far surpass his father. Peleus’ line would be assured. But, like all the gods’ gifts, there was an edge to it; the goddess herself was unwilling.”The Gods whisper in his ear. Don’t even bother trying to woo her with kelp flowers, Aquaoir Ocean aged wine, or shrimp cocktail. The Greek Gods, being rampant assaulters of unsuspecting, pink cheeked, mortal maidens, have no compunction about advocating rape. Jump her on the beach, take her, and make her thine!The Greek Islands are lousy with half Gods. You will meet many of them in the course of this story. Achilles is the greatest of them all. Greater than Hercules. His chosen companion is Patroclus, the disgraced and banished son of a king, an odd choice in many eyes as the closest friend of the greatest warrior. Patroclus is, after all, rather unremarkable at...well...everything. It doesn’t matter, though, because Achilles is good enough at everything for the both of them.Thetis is rather annoyed at his choice. She doesn’t feel that Patroclus is good enough to spend so much time with her son. Her favorite greeting for Patroclus is:”You will be dead soon enough.”With Patroclus being the narrator of this story, it is rather poor judgement on her part. Any quest I’ve been on I have always plied the narrator with honeyed wine and the most succulent figs in the hope that I would be rewarded in the prose and poetry of his/her telling of the tale.Achilles and Patroclus by Barry J.C. PurvesHomer skates around the closeness between Achilles and Patroclus, although much can be read between the lines. There is also the possibility that some homophobic Christian hundreds of years later made some deft corrections to the original, obscuring any overt reference to a homosexual relationship. Homer may have been blind, but his ears must have heard the rustling of the reed mats whether he was an “eye” witness to the Trojan War or an interpreter of events many years later. Madeline Miller wades into the sweaty bedsheet truth of the matter, and yes, the Greatest Warrior to ever live is light in his sandals.Miller puts flesh on these ancient bones, Gods and mortals alike, and brings a freshness to one of our most venerated stories. Though I resisted, it turns out that Madeline Miller was writing these books for me. She has also given me a burning desire to readThe Iliadagain while her interpretation is still imprinted so deeply in my mind. I have a feeling my reading experience will be deepened and her observations will glow like phosphorus between the lines.If you wish to see more of my most recent book and movie reviews, visithttp://www.jeffreykeeten.comI also have a Facebook blogger page at:https://www.facebook.com/JeffreyKeeten'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""1.5 stars.Aw man, where do I start with this one?I know that the big majority of people love this book. They cried and were heartbroken and it was the best thing they ever read and shit, but for me? It was justsoboring. The characters were horrendous, if I wanted to read about the most useless, passive and boring narrator being in love with this attractive, golden god, dude with no personality, and when he does have one, he just turns to a selfish prick, I would rereadTwilight. Seriously, can Patroclus be any more of a Bella?The writing was mediocre, the author clearly knows her stuff, but the dialogues were often ridiculous, the pacing was off. This storyNEVERseemed to end. Now I wonder:how the hell does an epic tale become such a bland, flat story?Ok, confession time, I never readThe Iliad. I am 90% sure I readThe Odysseytwice in my school years, yup, blame it on my school to make us read the same book twice just years apart. I am, however, familiar with this story. I enjoy Greek mythology and I was all for this book and its premise. But it was just not for me.My biggest problem with the book was the characters, like I said before, they were awful characters.Patroclusis portrayed from the beginning as this weak, bland guy who can't defend himself and, throughout the book, that never changes. He is one of the most passive characters I've ever read. He is there solely to admire every physical aspect of Achilles, damn this guy had a thing for homeboy's feet. Seriously Patroclus,we get it, Achilles's feet were soft and pink and smell amazing. I got the message, and I also got how golden his skin and hair and everything in him was. Guy's hot, noted. What drove me crazy was the fact that Achilles really was the sole reason of Patroclus's existence. Without him, he didn't know how to do anything, he didn't have a reason to live and I just,ugh, really?We are going there?The whole''if he dies, I'll die too cause there's nothing for me after him''speech?Ugh. Even though Achilles and Patroclus had zero chemistry(seriously how many times do these guys talk, like really talk, in this book?)Do I have to believe that this good for nothing kind of guy, with no personality whatsoever, is actually the most beloved person for the best of the greeks? For this demigod? I just can't buy into this relationship that happens to be theentire focusof this book. It's like the author takes for granted that we know this is a love story between them sowhy botherto actually develop a relationship?Achilles, he had no personality either until almost the very end of this book and then he turns into this selfish, proud asshole that even though is letting everyone be killed and failing to notice how dumb his decision is, is still admired and revered by Patroclus...I just...this book is just so dumb sometimes.Ofthe storyI can't say much becausenothinghappens. Seriously, we spend years in places and there's nothing to further the plot, it's like we are just waiting for the call against Troy. It is so boring and in this time, there's never a change in these characters. To me, the 8 years old Patroclus is the same Patroclus at the end. I don't know if it is because the story is told in past tense or if it's definitely a mistake from the author, butit reads the same. Through Patroclus's childhood, adolescence and adulthood, the character and his views feel exactly the same, which is ridiculous. For example, when all their greeks companions are dying and Achilles refuses to fight, even though Patroclus knows it's the stupidest decision ever, he refuses to say something and act, so what do they do? They both just consider to maybe swim or play later that day...I repeat, this book can be so dumb.I don't understandThetisrole in here and why was Achilles so devoted to hear her and always obey her. Why was Achilles the perfect son, I don't understand because they clearly had a lot of issues.I can't really say more, because I would be criticizing the same things over and over. I had a lot of issues with this book, this book took me more than a month to readMore than a month!A book that I was planning to finish in 4 days... It seemed like it wouldNEVERend. The prophecy said that Achilles would die shortly after Hector, you don't know how many times I was rooting for this dude to die so everything could end soon.JUST SOMEONE COULD PLEASE KILL HECTOR NOW.Anyway, if you liked this book, and judging by the ratings and reviews everyone and their mother loved this book, good for you! I personally had one of the most boring and frustrating experiences reading this. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had read theIliad, but I sincerely doubt it. That being said, the only thing and character I truly enjoyed was Odysseus.You go, Odysseus. You da best Odysseus!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Madeline Miller did what the movie producers of the film Troy (2004) were too cowardly to do; she stayed true to the homosexuality of Homer’sIliadrather than writing a censored version of the story which stank of homophobia. Achilles and Patroclus were passionately in love, which resulted in their respective destructions. They were not cousins or man at arms, but soul mates. The watering down of this in the film Troy was an insult to the LGBT community. Nothing more. Nothing less.The attraction between these two men wasn’t something that was rushed and squandered. It was built up, ever so slowly, and delivered eloquently. The two were friends from boyhood, and Patroclus was enamoured by Achilles after just one glance. He didn’t want to be parted from him. The two grew up together, they fought together, they learnt together and they developed together. They became inseparable and reliant on each other. Their sexual relationship just matured as they did it; it was the most natural thing in the world.Like all relationships, there were issues. The two weren’t without their differences. They clashed and quarrelled but only because they truly cared for each other. Patroclus wanted to end the war, and Achilles didn’t think the fight was worthy of his name: he wanted a bigger war to fight in. So, Patroclus, in his most bravest and stupid move goes against his lover’s wish and tries to end the war with a stroke of his sword. But he is no Achilles: he is not a god of war. He was out of his depth, outmatched and doomed.It could only end in tragedy- ""Achilles Laments the Death of Patroclus"" 1767.I’ve not included a spoiler warning because everybody knows the story of Homer’sIliad.Well, at least, I hope they do! Following the traditional narrative arc, Achilles goes on a mad rampage to avenge the death of his beloved. In the process he simultaneously destroys and immortalises himself. He got what he wanted, but not in the way he wanted it. I love the way the author wrote this, I could really feel the desperate rage of an Achilles who had lost the only thing that mattered to him in the world.I’m so glad the author didn’t deviate from the suggestions of homosexuality that were present in Homer’s writing. This would have failed dramatically had she done so. There would have been no power, and, again, like the film Troy it would have been abysmal. The romance plot in here is one of the truest and believable I’ve read to date: it was strong and real. However, this is not to downplay the other aspects of the story. It is driven by romance, but it is not defined by it. There is also a story of growth, and the story of warrior who is out to prove his strength and honour in a world driven by war. He just happens to like guys.A strong four starsp.s- I’ve purposely avoided images of the movie Troy in this review. Anybody who has seen it and read this book really shouldn’t be putting the two side by side, at least, not if they want to make their review fair. One is an insult to the story, the other a novelisation of a timeless classic.___________________________________You can connect with me on social media viaMy Linktree.__________________________________'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Watch the video review here:""Achilles.

Even though I knew how it was going to end, I was not prepared for how much Icared.This is the story of the fall of Troy. Or rather, a part of it. More specifically, this is the tale of Achilles and Patroclus. Of their undying love for each other. Of the lives they sacrifice on the altar of that love. Of desperate men and petty gods. Of a proud, greedy people engaged in a prolonged, bloody war.So often in historical fiction from this time period I see the sharp edges of the Ancient Greek and Roman cultures smoothed away. I see slaves treated well and women given a voice. I\'m happy to say there was none of that bullshittery here. Miller paints the pages of this book in blood and suffering. It is awash with pain and brutality. As it should be. Because historical accuracy.But, it means that this book is not for everyone. There is a lot of sexism, misogyny, violence, bloodshed, and rape, mentioned almost offhand, because, to these characters, this behavior is commonplace. Expected. I didn\'t like a single one of them. And not just because of their worldviews. There was Achilles and his hubris. Patroclus and his uselessness. Thetis and her coldness. I didn\'t even like Odysseus and his famous wit, for there was an edge to it in this book that made him seem less charming and more manipulative than I remember.That said, as much as I disliked these characters, I loved their stories. Miller took gods and legends and brought them to life within the pages of this book. She humanized these mythical beings in a way that made them seem real, fallible.I just...I cannot say enough about this book. To me, this is literature at its finest.

The Song of Achilles retells the story of Greece's greatest hero from the point of view of his best friend Patroclus. The big twist: Madeline Miller casts the story as a romance between Achilles and Patroclus. While staying true to Greek legends and the works of Homer, Miller creatively and convincingly fills in the blanks, giving Patroclus a back story that makes perfect sense, and tracing the friendship, and eventual romance, between the two young men in a way that casts a new light on the human side of the Trojan War.I always found Achilles to be an unsympathetic character -- a brat, a bully, a big-headed jerk who knows he's the star player on the team and throws a tantrum if he gets put on the bench. Miller shows his unattractive qualities, but she also shows that Achilles is human. He's capable of love. He's deeply conflicted. He has a sense of humor and a gentle side. We see him through Patroclus's eyes, growing from a privileged child to a sensitive teen to a young man struggling to balance his personal feelings with the expectations of an entire country. If you've read the Iliad, you know that the story will have a tragic end, but it's also strangely uplifting and hopeful. I'll never be able to read about these characters the same way again, and that's a good thing. Reading The Song of Achilles put a new light on this ancient story. It was like watching a really good interpretation of a Shakespeare play. You think you know the story, but you're surprised to find how many layers of new meaning can be brought out by a smart production.The book is certainly appropriate for YA and up. The prose is elegant in its simplicity. Miller gives Patroclus a Hemmingway-like directness. I read a New York Times review of this book which I thought patently unfair, complaining that the style made the book seem like a fast-food version of the Iliad. I think this misses the whole point of the story. Patroclus's mission in The Song of Achilles is to cut through the legend of the hero and show us the mortal side of demigod. He doesn't want the pompous metaphors and flowery hyperbole of a war epic to bury Achilles's other qualities -- his tenderness, his insecurity, his honesty and lack of guile. The Song of Achilles can serve as an excellent introduction or counterpoint to the study of the Iliad. It certainly made the story new and vibrant for me, despite how many times I've read Homer.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""***2 stars***I know this is an unpopular opinion, but I did not like this book. And I must confess that the fault partly lies with me, because I did not read the blurb before I dived in. After having loved Miller's Circe, it was a no-brainer that I'd want to read her take on the Trojan War - so I left it at that and just began reading. Lesson learned, because I wanted this to be more historical fiction, yet it was basically just romance fantasy - hence my disappointment.In this tale the narrator is Patroclus, best friend and lover of Achilles. Even though I haven't read The Iliad (yet), and I know that Patroclus was not necessarily one of the greatest Greek warriors, I do know that he played a major role in the Greek victory over the Trojans. And Madeline chose to portray him as a weakling in her story, which I think is a shame.From a romance novel point of view the love story between the two didn't work for me because I think that throughout the book Patroclus was too dependent and clingy and I don't like that type of relationship. His life only revolves around this great, beautiful hero and more often than not, it seemed that he was by Achilles' side on every step - even when he isn't supposed to be, he tags along anyway. I wish he was more of his own person, a more dynamic character and also a more competent fighter, instead of this physically weak person. I am a big enough romance fan, but at times this was too soapy for my taste.From a mythological novel point of view - if you are seeking a book about the Greek and Trojan war, I personally suggest skipping this one. In my opinion it is barely a retelling of myth, because only writing about the private lives, loves and bedrooms of classical gods/demigods/heroes does nothing to make us understand the grounds on which classicism was built. For me it was disappointing, since I really wanted the richness of the actual story and not just romance. Not only was Patroclus and Achilles' love story the main focus, it was pretty much the only subject matter throughout. Could have been really well done if the events of Troy were more thoroughly framed in the context of the love story.But hey! If you're looking for a socially relevant, modern treatment of a classic tale or simply for some romance fantasy, this might be the perfect read for you!""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""Name one hero who was happy . . .

But before that, he is just a boy growing up in Phthia with his devoted companion Patroclus by his side. The two are sent away to the mountains to be trained, but it isn\'t long before war comes calling when Helen of Troy is kidnapped. Achilles is forced to choose between eternal glory and mediocrity, but with greatness comes a price that Achilles and Patroclus will both have to pay.Well, now I feel a bit silly for having waited so long to read this! If I had known how remarkable and thrilling of a taleThe Song of Achillesis, I would have gobbled it up years ago.I thought it was really interesting that this story is told from Patroclus\'s perspective. In Greek mythology, Patroclus is a minor character and hardly ever mentioned, but he is central to this tale. And through his eyes, we are able to see all the facets of Achilles: the making of a hero though still a boy at heart, shining and bright, easily seduced by glory, and ultimately a tragic figure.It\'s not easy to take a beloved and much-revered story and make it your own, but Miller did a masterful job. This retelling feels fresh and sharp, relevant to the modern audience while still staying true to the original material. It has everything you would expect from Greek mythology: love, war, glory, sacrifice, and redemption. I was hooked from the first page to the last.This has one of the best endings I\'ve come across in a long time. It isn\'t so much what happens as the way it is written. Visceral and gut-wrenching, it builds in power and emotion until I was good and blubbering. It gave me all the feels.It took me so long to get to this book. I think I was afraid it wouldn\'t live up to all the hype I\'d heard over the years. But it was worth the wait.

Oftentimes, the romance will be my least favorite aspect of a given story, but for some reason, this one struck me straight in the feels.There was something sopure and confidentin their love.They were loyal, brave and kind to one another in a way that had me reaching for the tissues instead of choking down my mirth.I just knew from my level of attachment that this one wasn't going to end well for me.

While the sequence of events does follow the Trojan war, war part only feels like a sub-plot which complements the main plot beautifully. The reader would rarely await the outcomes of war, for, the amazing and somewhat poetic narrative keeps one deeply immersed in the feelings of the main character. Still, you\'ll come across the brutalities of war as well, and how they change the characters and their personalities as the story progresses.""I find the folly of men amusing.""As I was finishing the first half of the book, it didn\'t feel that eventful or impressive in itself. Sure, it was interesting and had a nice flow to it, with some intricate details about both Achilles and Patroclus, but it didn\'t feel like anything new: a regular romance novel. But as you finish through the last chapters, those seemingly uneventful - though quite emotional - first half will deepen the reader\'s emotions profoundly. I think a re-read of this might prove very difficult, especially with the first half, with being familiar with the ending. Still, you\'ll definitely re-read this.""No man is worth more than another, wherever he is from.""It might be easy to hate Achilles during the latter half of the story, based on some of his decisions, and rightly so. But, I think it\'s a good thing that the author did not alter his character to fix those flows. The objective of the story was never to portrait the greatness of Achilles.

It was written in 431 BC, more than 2,400 years ago. Greek mythology is incredibly interesting. The characters are unique, imperfect, have a rich and interesting backstory, and don’t necessarily conform to gender norms. The play itself only takes about 1 hour and 45 minutes to read. However, because the language is so archaic, I spent more time referring to reference materials on Medea than it took me for the actual reading.This book is brilliant because the language has been modernized. This reads much smoother than Medea. The action is fast-paced, and the writing style of short paragraphs makes for a quick read. Additionally, the storytelling itself is incredible. The author tells the story in a very compelling way. Instead of focusing on guts and glory, Miller weaves in the romance between Patroclus and Achilles. She also sets the stage for fascinating political and moral dilemmas.Overall, this was an incredible emotional journey, and one of the best (if not the best) retellings that I have ever read.2025 Reading ScheduleJan\tA Town Like AliceFeb\tBirdsongMar\tCaptain Corelli's Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr\tWar and PeaceMay\tThe Woman in WhiteJun\tAtonementJul\tThe Shadow of the WindAug\tJude the ObscureSep\tUlyssesOct\tVanity FairNov\tA Fine BalanceDec\tGerminalConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeInstaMy Bookstore at Pango""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""I am going to disagree with the Orange Prize committee.

In truth, there was a hesitancy inside me;The Illiad, the stories of Achilles, Hector, and Odysseus are stories that I’ve read and heard about so many times before in several mediums. In my mind, before I read this book, I simply didn’t think that I would love reading another retelling surrounding this tale again. As you can guess from my high rating, Miller has righted the wrong notion that nestled deep in me.“True. But fame is a strange thing. Some men gain glory after they die, while others fade. What is admired in one generation is abhorred in another."" He spread his broad hands. ""We cannot say who will survive the holocaust of memory. Who knows?"" He smiles. ""Perhaps one day even I will be famous. Perhaps more famous than you.”If there’s one thing that we can agree and admire about Achilles, it would be his strength. Almost every story about the legend of Achilles portrayed him on a similar nature; he’s a mortal who possesses godlike abilities for battles. Bow down before his prowess. And it’s not like Miller didn’t include Achilles’ skills for devastation in her retelling; she did magnificently. However, Miller goes above and beyond by humanizing him through Patroclus’ eyes. Miller starts the story from Patroclus’ and Achilles’ childhood, and she successfully showed the genuine development in their characterizations and relationship that the passage of time can’t prevent.“He is a weapon, a killer. Do not forget it. You can use a spear as a walking stick, but that will not change its nature.”The entire novel is told exclusively through the first perspective of Patroclus, and this is what sets Miller’s retelling apart from so many other media. This reading experience reminded me of readingLancelotby Giles Kristian. Both Giles Kristian and Madeline Miller did the same thing with their craft. Through Patroclus’ view, we get to see Achilles’ vulnerability, and we also get to see Achilles’ aptitude for virtues that most of the time were concealed in many retellings. I thought knowing how the journey will end for these characters would diminish my experience, but the opposite occurred; the hindsight in the finality of their story actually elevated my reading experience extensively. For example, there were lines—I won’t mention them in my review—about Hector repeatedly spoken by Achilles that act as a dagger that inflicted a sharp cut to the heart every time it’s unsheathed.“There are no bargains between lion and men. I will kill you and eat you raw.”There’s an enchanting quality in Miller’s prose. For almost a decade, hundreds of thousands of readers/reviewers around the world have been charmed by her writing style, and now you can definitely count me among these entranced readers. What I found to be the most incredible aspect of this novel is how well-conveyed were the feelings of the characters; they popped out of the pages effectively. It is always crucial to learn what truly matters in life and to never lose sight of them; trust, pride, jealousy, and the seduction of glory tests Patroclus’ and Achilles’ relationship to its maximum limit. The pacing was great, and the last five chapters of this novel capture the everlasting brilliance of the horror and tragedy in this tale. The sense of grief, the meteoric fury, and the comfort that love provides amidst blood and death felt profoundly physical to me.“And perhaps it is the greater grief, after all, to be left on earth when another is gone.”The cover art of this book usually depicts the golden armor/helmet/lyre of Achilles, and there’s an underlying message behind these cover arts; it contains mandatory advice that you should prepare yourself before reading this book. Guard your heart and mind carefully; there’s a prophecy conjured that they won’t remain unscathed after you read the breathtaking lyrics written inThe Song of Achilles. Every page was a bait to lure me away from reality, and I devour those bait willingly. I look forward to readingCircevery soon to witness more of Miller’s talent, and more importantly, to put her storytelling as an item to be locked in my memories.“I am made of memories.”Aren’t we all, Patroclus?You can order the book from:Book Depository (Free shipping)You can findthisand the rest of my reviews atNovel NotionsSpecial thanks to my Patrons onPatreonfor giving me extra support towards my passion for reading and reviewing!My Patrons: Alfred, Devin, Hamad, Joie, Mike, Miracle, Nicholas.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'In my mind, they never left Pelion.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'the vibe of ""i feel like i could eat the world raw"" vs. ""i will kill u & eat u raw""but actually, the only thing that waseaten rawwas my heartrep:achillean mc & li'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I feel a bit silly doing this, but I have put a spoiler alert on this review, just in case there are folks out there who might not be versed in the classics.In a nutshell, Boy meet demi-god.

Greece loses demi-god, the happy couple wind up sharing an afterlife.Madeline Miller- image from her siteYou might want to dust off your Iliad, as this is a retelling of the story of Achilles, you know, the greatest warrior of his time, from that slightly older work. It is impressive, when looking up details from Miller’s novel, how directly her version corresponds to that of Homer.It was very important to me to stay faithful to the events of Homer’s narrative. The central inspiration behind the book is the terrible moment in the Iliad when Achilles hears about Patroclus’ death. His reaction is shocking in its intensity. The great half-god warrior—who carelessly defies rules, and condemns a whole army to death—comes completely unglued, desperate with grief and rage. I wanted to understand what it was about Patroclus and their relationship that could create that kind of crisis. Although Homer tells us what his characters do, he doesn’t tell us much of why they do it. Who was Achilles? And why did he love Patroclus so much?Patroclus is a twelve-year-old prince down on his luck. Born of a damaged mother and possessed of none of the obvious gifts that make fathers proud, he defends himself against a bully. The bully slips, falls, coshes his deserving skull on a rock and the planet is one bully lighter. Oops, sorry. But since the bully was a royal, Pops exiles Patroclus to the island of Phthia. (Go ahead, try to say it out loud, five times fast, or at all. You know you want to. Sounds like Parseltongue to me.) Luckily for him, the island’s king, Peleus, is kind and receptive. In fact he seems to have made a business of re-treading unwanted, or in-need-of-training blue-bloods, running a sort of island of lost royalty, a military training camp for boys. He is also father to the luminous Achilles. The questionably-heeled one (BTW, the heel never enters the story here. As Miller explains on her website, it was added to the myth of Achilles way later, by the Romans) is presented in such glowing terms that we are uncertain if the author is elevating him to the level of Homeric perfection, or we are seeing the externalization of the smitten Patroclus’ achy smitten-ness. In any case, Achilles turns out to be a pretty decent sort, and takes Patroclus under his wing, even inviting him to share his room. In time it gets steamy. Boys have, well, needs, and their inclinations, it turns out, are in synch. Thankfully the soft-core element of this story cools down enough to give us a look at the times, the idiocy of the Trojan War, and the ridiculousness of leadership, which does not seem to have changed all that much over the millennia. While some physical intimacy is noted, the author very much focuses on theaffectionbetween the two as a moving force.What one gets here is a touch and feel (go ahead and snicker) of what life might have been like at the time of the Trojan War. And it sounds like they could have used a few of the more contemporary Trojans, what with unintended pregnancies and all. Patroclus is our eyes and ears, but he is not merely a plot device. He is a fleshed-out character with significant conflicts to resolve, and growth to endure. Miller says,In writing this novel, I thought a lot about personal responsibility. Patroclus is not an epic person, the way Achilles is. He’s an “ordinary” man. But he has more power than he thinks, and the moments where he reaches out to others and offers what he sees as his very modest assistance have huge positive ramifications. Most of us aren’t Achilles—but we can still be Patroclus. What does it mean to try to be an ethical person in a violent world?You will have to suspend your disbelief a bit, as magical things do happen. Just as Homer included magical elements in his epic, so Miller follows. Gods do indeed engage themselves in human affairs. Achilles is the product of a human father and a fishy-dearest sea nymph of a mother. The lads are trained by a centaur, Chiron, who is a pretty cool character, (fans of Harry Potter will recognize in Chiron the source for Hogwarts’ own Firenze, also a teacher of medicine, and overall good guy) and of course the gods can’t help but interfere with the doings of men, like early-version Koch Brothers with training in the Dark Arts. Miller takes the odd liberty here and there. Patroclus, for example, was older than Achilles in the Iliad. They are the same age here. ButThe Song of Achillesisa novel.Miller gets her importantfactsright. Of course, the facts have to do with re-creating the story told by the great Greek poet, not, you know, actual facts. Unless of course you are one of those who believes that Achilles’ mother, Thetis, really was a sea nymph, or that the actual Greek gods personally interfered with the goings on down below. There are plenty of people who believe stranger things. In fact, the clearly homosexual relationship between Achilles and Patroclus is sure to raise the hackles of folks who hold beliefs of a more contemporary theistic bent. Expect to see calls for this book to be banned in the usual places. But really, it’s the 21st century. Get over it. If it was good enough for the Iliad…Miller is a classics scholar and teacher and knows her stuff. What she has done here is take the eternal tale and re-tell it in a manner that is easy to read. In fact it is so easy to read that it felt like a YA title to me. Maybe too easy? She does teach high-schoolers, so I expect that was her target demographic, but it still seemed a bit young to me.While I have no philosophical issue with the same-sex element of the tale, I found the youthful pining and sex scenes mushy and maybe gag-worthy, but once the pairing is secured, the story is free to flow back to Homer’s tale. It does so smoothly and well.One benefit of this book is that it offers young readers an entrée to one of the great works of literature in a more accessible form. I expect that Miller will eventually get around to producing another modern interpretation from the classics. In the meantime, if you are a student, seek this lady out and take her classes. She seems to me like the sort of teacher we all dreamed of having and rarely got, in love with her material and able to communicate it well.Review first posted – February 3, 2012Publication dates (USA)----------March 6, 2012 - hardcover----------August 28, 2012 - trade paperback=============================EXTRA STUFFDefinitely check outMiller’s web site, one of the better author sites I have seen.

A lyrical masterpiece that portrays the human side of the man, the lover, and the warrior who is destined to fulfil a prophecy that sees him fall after the death of Hector, sustaining the iconic Achilles heel injury.A story that is epic, timeless, and sad but told with great sentiment, heart, and soul. A book that does not try to recount the historical events of the past and the myths but rather embellishes them to play the song of Achilles.The Plot (skip if you know the plot)“In the darkness, two shadows, reaching through the hopeless, heavy dusk. Their hands meet, and light spills in a flood like a hundred golden urns pouring out of the sun.”Achilles meets Patroclus at school at the age of twelve, and soon the unlikely pairing of these two boys becomes a deep friendship. Wanting to separate the two boys and to begin Achilles life’s teachings, Achilles’ mother Thetis, sends him off to the centaur Chiron for three years to learn literature, nature, sacrifice, and the art of battle. However, not to be torn away from his friend, Patroclus follows Achilles into the caves and remains with him for three years as the love between the two blossoms.Following the legendary story of Helen of Troy, Achilles is asked to join Agamemnon’s forces to defend his brothers honour after Paris steels the beautiful Helen from her home. And now Achilles must fight for the honour of the most beautiful woman in the world, against the mightiest city of the east. A journey to Aulis and then Troy that will seal the fate of these two men.“The never-ending ache of love and sorrow. Perhaps in some other life I could have refused, could have torn my hair and screamed, and made him face his choice alone. But not in this one. He would sail to Troy and I would follow, even into death. Yes, I whispered. Yes”Review and CommentsThe Song of Achilles is first a love story and a tragedy but then the best love stories make the best tragedies and ‘The Song of Achilles’ meets all those expectations. Whilst there is no shortage of books that take their inspiration from centuries old stories of Greek Mythology, few will be ambitious enough to venture on a retelling of one of Greek Mythology’s best loved stories and Achilles life story from boyhood, and the boy who became a man and an infamous warrior.In doing so Miller tells of a love story that is sentimental but not overflowing in its protestations of love, a relationship that is touching but not overly emotional and a tale of two men human, flawed, imperfect but who each bring depth of character in their roles and strong in their principles but protective of each other.What I liked less was the slow burn nature of a book in the first half when the period and story already offered so much for the author to embellish.Nevertheless, this is a small point in a book that was truly stunning in its story telling, a brilliant work of fiction interwoven with the myths, legends and the greatest stories told in Greek mythology. A book that has modernised the legendary work of Homer but stayed true to the core of the Iliad and Achilles homosexuality. A human portrayal of a demi-god who loves, fights, and conquers. Yet it is his stubbornness and unyielding pride that is ultimately his downfall, but then again it was always written in the song – and if “..Music be the food of love. Play on” (William Shakespeare).4/5 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '‘I am made of memories.’Storytelling is a key form of cultural memory, dating back to early visual and oral traditions of passing on stories from generation to generation. Through retellings, stories are not only passed along and retained, but often reshaped and reexamined, adding a larger texture and nuance and growing the myths.The Song of Achilles, the debut novel from Madeline Miller, is another in a long tradition of retellings of the Greek myths and zooms in from the large, sweeping epic scale of the Trojan War tales into an intimate and largely interior look at the relationship between Patrocles and Achilles. It is a deeply moving portrait of a lifelong love between the two, traversing the years together from training in the wilderness with Chiron to the violent years in the siege of Troy that immortalized Achilles name even to this day. By reframing the tale through the eyes of an otherwise minor mortal in the vast battle—beautiful in his naïvety, frustrations and hope—Miller reminds us that every life contains a universe of loves and hopes, fears and griefs. Mostly adhering to the tale as you know it, Miller writes in an accessible and engaging prose that plucks each emotional string in your heart as Achilles’ song on the lute does to Patrocles, passing along the tale for a new generation.‘We were like gods at the dawning of the world, & our joy was so bright we could see nothing else but the other.’Retellings fascinate me and I think are a really cool way to honor the traditions of storytelling. In his 1955 publication ofThe Greek Myths, historianRobert Graveswas concerned the classics had gone so far out of popular consciousness that even ‘an educated man’ wasn’t expected to know the references. Yet today Greek mythology continues to exist in pop culture and while many were still writing myth retellings before Miller, the continued popularity ofThe Song of Achillesstill hitting bestseller lists 12 years after its publication in 2011—and her follow up,Circehas spurred a huge revival in myth retellings (from where I sit right now at the bookstore, there are at least 4 on the New In display from the past few months). Personally, I find this to be exciting as a continuation of oral retellings into printed retellings but people can have strong opinions on versions especially if they liked an older one.This puts Miller in a tricky spot, especially with a debut where there isn’t any goodwill built up in the reader yet. In his bookRetelling Stories, Framing Culture,John Stephenssays that there is ‘a tendency…to privilege similarity over difference,’ which is a dilemma constructing retellings because deviating from whichever version of a tale someone finds to be their subjective best is met with criticism (look at how upset people still are over Disney dropping the Star Wars Expanded Universe from canon). While Graves might be pleased to know the Greek classics references are even known by children thanks to films like Disney’sHercules,Rick Riordan’sPercy Jacksonseries, or countless videogames, we also have to wonder if the strong deviations from the tales in his book would irk him the wayJack Zipesutterly despises any children\'s films of old fairy tales as diluting the story (I like to think of them as ""versions"" that can lead you to the originals, personally. Like gateway drugs for literature). If I have one criticism ofSong of Achilles, it is perhaps that it didn’t change things enough as I really enjoy when authors use retellings as a catalyst for an idea beyond the retelling, such as discussing having an Atlas complex in our own lives asJeanette Wintersondoes inWeight. I do feel there is likely a balance on intent, how much is changed, and for what reason, which is why retellings set modern day are given less scrutiny and with this book being as immersed in the idea of just telling the story from a personal perspective, see how it opens it up for more splitting hairs on details. But then again, the Greek myths are not corporate IP and evenThe Iliadis just an author\'s interpretation on a long line of oral telling. There is no objective canon, just versions and that is cool so just have fun with it. It’s a mythology of mythologies, do whatever you want and just do it well.I enjoy where Miller deviates and I think the intentions are well accomplished in many places. In Homer, we understand Patrocles to be a strong warrior, not quite the match of Achilles, but certainly more so than he is presented here. Which is where memory and retellings come in. Telling the story from his perspective allows us to see him how he saw himself and in supposed real-time, making the traditional view of him one that was formedbecauseof his story being told long after his death drawing on assumptions from his shared tomb with Achilles. It is not only a retelling, but a shifting of perspectives. We see Odysseus as rather different even between her two books because Patrocles and Circe have different perspectives on him. While perhaps there is an argument to be made this book doesn’t have the same scholarly value as other versions or the source material, I think it resonated with me quite strongly and to me that’s what matters most. But I also don’t find much joy in disliking things and tend to try to open myself to enjoying them so I guess take what I say with a grain of salt.‘He is half of my soul, as the poets say. He will be dead soon, and his honor is all that will remain.’What I’m getting at is my fears of this being too similar and not holding up was instantly abated because I simply loved reading this. It validates its own reason for a retelling because it puts us inside the battle that feels huge around us and not for the purpose of glorifying the strongest of the people killing each other over some rich asshole deciding his wife leaving him was excuse enough for mass murder but to show how love is tested and tortured under such a conflict. Miller points out in aninterviewthat, while ‘Homer tells us what his characters do, he doesn’t tell us much of why they do it,’ and I enjoy the way she dives into the psychology of thewhy. And, for Patroclus, that why is love. Which I suppose is the best why. Even when you are doing something ill-advised like throwing on some armor to uphold your lover\'s image and promptly finding yourself pants shittingly dead at the end of Hector’s blade. Because that scene hit me in all the feelings. But for real, have tissues on hand for the last bit of this one.‘I could recognize him by touch alone, by smell; I would know him blind, by the way his breaths came and his feet struck the earth. I would know him in death, at the end of the world.’This book is endlessly quotable and the overall telling earns the individual lines, making it still fresh with poetry despite being in prose form. I think the love story was successful as it manages to seem subversive in the present without having to actually really be, and doesn’t fall victim to imposing modern moralizing onto historical events. Reading it today when books having queer content are being removed from shelves—or when it first was published in 2011 before the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges US Supreme Court ruling legalizing same-sex marriage—seems pointed but scholars have argued this sort of relationship, especially amongst nobility, would have not been a scandal and Achilles and Patrocles being lovers doesn’t really raise any eyebrows in the book. Many have previously asserted the pair as lovers, similar with Alexander the Great and Hephaestion, including a nod to it in Plato’sThe Symposium(where Miller says she stole the idea). As Miller says:’The idea that Patroclus and Achilles were lovers is quite old…We even have a fragment from a lost tragedy of Aeschylus, where Achilles speaks of his and Patroclus’ “frequent kisses.” There is a lot of support for their relationship in the text of the Iliad itself, though Homer never makes it explicit. For me, the most compelling piece of evidence, aside from the depth of Achilles’ grief, is how he grieves: Achilles refuses to burn Patroclus’ body, insisting instead on keeping the corpse in his tent, where he constantly weeps and embraces it—despite the horrified reactions of those around him. That sense of physical devastation spoke deeply to me of a true and total intimacy between the two men.’The emotional intensity of this scene burns so brightly in the book you could read it on a moonless night. I do enjoy seeing their relationship tested and I think Miller does an interesting job portraying the different paths they take during the conflict with Patroclus opting to be a medic instead of a warrior while Achilles seems misguided using violence as a path to fame. Some of the bits, such as Achilles freeing Briseis, are framed in a way that feel a bit too much like “okay but looks he’s not all bad” though I was fine with having Achilles being morally gray on the darker shade of the spectrum because Patroclus still loving him in spite of his rage and disgust at him was beautiful enough to nod need to sugar coat anything.‘The never-ending ache of love and sorrow. Perhaps in some other life I could have refused, could have torn my hair and screamed, and made him face his choice alone. But not in this one. He would sail to Troy and I would follow, even into death.’The lesson from Chiron is well baked into the story, that ‘no man is worth more than another, wherever he is from,’ and one can certainly interpretSong of Achillesas an thematically anti-war without being overly heavy handed. Odysseus reminds Patroclus ‘He’s going to Troy to kill men, not rescue them…’ and we know a fall is coming and that the promise of glory on a battlefield is merely manipulation to get young men to lay down their lives for the glory of some king. InThe Odyssey, Odysseus speaks with the ghost of Achilles who laments having chosen the quick route to fame and quick route to death than the long, uneventful life, but here I think Miller elegantly constructs a portrait of a young boy who has been so talked up by his fate and by his mother, the sea nymph Thetis (unpopular opinion but I loved Thetis in this, I loved how terrifying Miller made her and her portrayal as symbolic of the cruelty of the gods just stuck the landing for me), that he had the optimistic hubris to think he could have it all. ‘They never let you be famous AND happy,’ Achilles says to Patroclus, insisting ‘I\'m going to be the first…because you’re the reason.’ Shit, I got chills just retyping that scene, its this beautiful naivete that you hold in your memory even when he is at his worst and weep for the downfall of the boy Patroclus once knew. And loved. And will love still. ‘I will never leave him,’ he says. That no amount of violence, shame or even the wrath of Agamemnon can bring Achilles down but the loss of his companion reduces him to tears and sets forth the fateful end is telling of the importance of their love to him as well.“There is no law that gods must be fair, Achilles,” Chiron said. “And perhaps it is the greater grief, after all, to be left on earth when another is gone. Do you think?”I could ramble about this book for a long time because it just really moved me and was a joy to read from start to finish. It has the feel of an epic without being epic in length, and Miller blends the romance with the action and political playmaking like an expert bartender ready to get you drunk on her art.The victors write the histories—as the saying goes—and Patroclus is pleading to push aside the ideas of glory in battle to focus on emotional connection as the true lasting glory. This is a very intimate and gorgeous novel that harnesses the power of retellings to create a rather lovely tale to pass along for the next generation and once again have us remember the names of Achilles and Patroclus.3.75/5‘The sorrow was so large it threatened to tear through my skin.

Che è forte e resistente anche quando vacilla, che non si abbatte nemmeno quando il più divertente e sexy ragazzo della terra piomba nella tua vita (ciao ares ti amo).Ho amato il modo in cui Haven è entrata poco a poco nella famiglia Lively facendosi spazio nel cuore di ognuno di loro e di conseguenza nel mio.Haven ne ha passate tante in questi due libri ma è riuscita ad alzarsi ogni volta che la vita l'ha schiacciata a terra. Insegnandoci che la famiglia di sangue non è l'unica e vera famiglia di cui abbiamo bisogno. A volte dietro a mele, biglietti criptici, giochi ambigui, torte di compleanno, piccoli sorrisi e gesti velati si nascondono quelle che saranno le persone più importanti della nostra vita. La famiglia in cui non nasciamo ma che decidiamo ogni singolo giorno di coltivare per dare vita a un meraviglioso giardino di papaveri blu dell'Himalaya.Di questo libro ho apprezzato ogni singolo personaggio che ha donato al romanzo un pezzo di sé per renderlo ancora più speciale. Un pezzo che ognuno di noi ha colto e portato con sé.Non smetterò mai di ringraziare il trio di Hermes, Liam e Posy per tutte le risate che mi hanno regalato. Zeus ed Hera per esserci stati sempre e comunque in qualsiasi momento di bisogno. Ares e Hades per avermi ricordato che le mie debolezze mi rendono la persona che sono oggi. Heaven per avermi insegnato che quando si è stanchi di lottare, quando la vita ti mette a dura prova c'è sempre qualcuno o qualcosa che ci aiuta ad andare avanti. Apollo per essere stato il fratello maggiore che tutti vorrebbero. Athena per avermi insegnato che dietro ogni corazza di ferro si cela un cuore morbidissimo che deve essere semplicemente scoperto. Aphrodite per tutte le parole dolci che ognuno di noi avrebbe bisogno di sentire in vita sua.Questo libro ha rotto e ribaltato qualsiasi dinamica si fosse creata precedentemente. Hades e Ares si sono avvicinati accorgendosi di tutte le loro affinità. Athena ha aperto il suo cuore a Liam. Hermes e Haven sono diventati una stella sola.Questo libro mi ha emozionata. Mi ha sorpresa con i continui colpi di scena, mi ha fatta sclerare tutte quelle volte in cui il libro prendeva una piega sbagliata. Mi ha fatta ridere forte e piangere tanto.Alla fine Haven ha trovato la sua famiglia e io la mia. Grazie nina, nena, chiara e lele per aver condiviso con me questa avventura e per averla resa speciale.Avrei preferito che tutto andasse liscio, avrei voluto veramente un lieto fine ma questo significa solo una cosa: sono pronta ad affrontare il chaos se di mezzo ci sarà la famiglia Lively.Ci vediamo presto a Yale, all'Olimpo o chissà dove.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'E tu, hai voglia di contare le stelle con noi?✨Game of Titans è il sequel di Game of Gods, con questo libro si conclude la storia di Haven e Hades: Ade e Persefone, per alcuni.È davvero difficile farvi una recensione su un libro che ho amato così tanto, perché qualsiasi mia frase non renderà mai reale quello che ho provato.Questo libro è pura dinamite e non scherzo, non c’è un solo momento in cui possiamo respirare con serenità perché nella famiglia Lively non c’è mai calma, soprattutto se di mezzo c’è quella folle di Cohen e gli altre tre dell’ave maria che ne combinano una più del diavolo: parlo di Ares, Apollo e Crono.

Everything she loves is in Midgard: her family, her friends, her mate. Stranded in a strange new world, she's going to need all her wits about her to get home again. And that's no easy feat when she has no idea who to trust.Hunt Athalar has found himself in some deep holes in his life, but this one might be the deepest of all. After a few brief months with everything he ever wanted, he's in the Asteri's dungeons again, stripped of his freedom and without a clue as to Bryce's fate. He's desperate to help her, but until he can escape the Asteri's leash, his hands are quite literally tied.In this sexy, breathtaking sequel to the #1 bestsellers House of Earth and Blood and House of Sky and Breath, Sarah J. Maas's Crescent City series reaches new heights as Bryce and Hunt's world is brought to the brink of collapse-with its future resting on their shoulders.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5 - ⭐️⭐️⭐️💫It feels surreal to have finally read a book I\'ve been anticipating for two years and I am a sobbing mess after finishing the HOFAS. I\'m already missing these characters so much.The following review will contain major spoilers fromHouse of Flame and Shadowso if you haven\'t finished reading I advise you not to read this review until then.Also, Sarah recently confirmed Crescent City book 4 is happening (probably in a few years). This one is a conclusion for Bryce\'s story.[MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW]...................................This book was one hell of an emotional ride and it might come as a surprise that I haven\'t rated it 5-star, but the more I thought about the book the more issues I found in it so I decided to deduct it from my 4-star rating to 3.5-star which is how I feel.I got some theories right which I\'m very excited about, I also got some theories wrong which was expected because I knew Sarah would throw a curveball at me in this book. It\'s fun to explore the possibilities as a reader but also I love it when the author surprises me and Sarah did, especially in part 1!!!Let\'s begin with the ACOTAR segment:Keep in mind that SJM changed the timeline gap she originally intended between ACOSF and HOFAS (which was around 6-9 months in her first draft)The gap between ACOSF\'s ending and HOFAS events isapproximately 3 months(Nesta said she killed Lanthys 7 months ago, which happened a month before Winter Solstice in ACOSF). So it\'s June/beginning of Summer in the ACOTAR world.The Middengard Worm making a cameo was not on my bingo card.- Nesta deserves a 5⭐️ for being the badass that she was in all the scenes. I loved seeing her in action and to see glimpses of the warm person behind an ice cold mask she mastered wearing. We see more of her sentimental side when Bryce plays music (in the bonus chapter) and when Nesta bids Ember and co. farewell. Nesta is set up to be an important player in ACOTAR5 now that she was left with Gwydion/Starsword and to find out why she got the eight-pointed star tattoo.- Azriel, my beloved, also deserves a 5⭐️. Seeing the spymaster and the Shadowsinger in action alongside Nesta was fun but also the crumbs SJM littered in the ACOTAR segment for him makes me even more thrilled for his arc in ACOTAR5, now that is a protagonist that is being well-prepped for his own book. We touch upon his mother and fondness of music in the bonus chapter, we still don\'t know how he got Truth-teller and the fact that his precious knife was originally owned by Enalius (the first of the Illyrians) and that is another tie to Illyria, we don\'t know how his shadows and magic work, he finds out through the Asteri under the Prison that the Illyrians were made by them, and honestly SJM gave more than what I expected when it comes to him. His personality is even more fleshed out and to my delight many of my friends and readers are warming up to him (he always had a personality you just needed to look closer).""[...] that wasn\'t there as Azriel landed fromabove them. His wings were spread so wide they nearly touched either side of the cavern.""Thank you Janet for confirming who has the largest wingspan yet again.- Now, Nesta and Azriel as a duo are incredible!!! I love their bond and friendship and seeing how much they look out and care about each other. They understand one another and that has been obvious to us since ACOSF, they both master putting on an icy mask to hide their emotions.Rhysand alongside Amren made a brief appearance at the beginning of the book and he seems apprehensive about the Asteri and the fact that anyone can walk into their world (I think we will see implications of that in ACOTAR5 being that Rhys saw two alien females fall into his world only months apart). He\'ll grapple with the question of who else can enter their world and how do they put a stop to it.I loved the ACOTAR segment so much because it was lore galore and I was craving all that info dump since ACOSF.The whole history of High King Fionn, Queen Theia, and Pelias was darker than I expected and I\'m glad Fionn did not turn out to be evil. I still feel enraged and devastated with what happened with Helena and Silene (Theia\'s daughters). It\'s almost impossible to excuse their actions but it is still sad that Theia damned her own family and people because she thirsty for more power.I can\'t wait to see what more will be revealed in ACOTAR5!The ACOTAR-related bonus chapters include: Walmart edition (Bryce, Nesta, Azriel) + BAM/Indigo (Ember and Randall).My current theory is some of the events in ACOTAR5 will happen in parallel with HOFAS (at least the first 30% of the book).To conclude this part, I\'m glad the crossover did not take over a big chunk of the book because it IS a Crescent City book.I wasn\'t rooting for a major crossover either with Throne of Glass (as much as it pains me to say it because I miss them), it would\'ve tangled up all 3 series and we would end up with a messy storyline. Major crossovers work for movies, not for books.The crossover was important for ACOTAR and CC because they are tied by history and we got answers that are important for both. We got resolution for it in this book, but not yet for ACOTAR. I didn\'t clarify earlier, we did get some TOG crumbs but it doesn\'t have the same level of implications as ACOTAR and it does leave the door open for a future crossover, but as of now we know most of TOG storylines had their resolution but Sarah did leave the door open for more stories.Now... moving on toCrescent CityI was rooting for Bryce but I did find her reckless and insufferable in many moments. It makes me miss HOEAB Bryce but in this book she\'s coming off too much self-absorbed.It\'s hard for me to buy the suprise schemes Bryce pre-planned, I mean it works for a character like Aelin but not Bryce. Certain scenes are convincing and some came out of the blue or were too convenient.Hunt is my darling and it was obvious throughout the book he is hesitant and triggered by his trauma since Shahar\'s rebellion so he will question every step they take, and Bryce seems pretty dismissive to him during those moments which... is not doing her any favors. She\'s not helping him through it and it makes my heart break even more for Hunt because he is so wary of upsetting her about it. Like, Bryce darling... he went through very gruesome torture sessions recently so cut him so slack.Don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE Quinlar and I\'m always rooting for them but... I hoped we would be past their trust issues and disagreements over minor things. I still want them to argue and fight, I don\'t want them to be a perfect couple but all this still rubbed me the wrong way.I also expected a soul-shattering, emotional reunion after the whole ""our love spans across time and universes"" quote but I felt underwhelmed with what I got given one of them was in another universe and the other was being tortured.Still, I got many other moments that I loved and cried and gushed over. Especially their bonus chapter!On the other hand, I devoured all of Ruhn and Lidia\'s chapters. Lidia\'s chapters especially are just *chef\'s kiss*.This book made me fall in love with them more and I was eating up all the angst, all the longing, and the intense sexual tension between them.I wish they got their own book though I need more of them.There were a few surprises about Lidia that I did not expect but I also love that for her and it helped to better understand her motivations.The chapters I struggled with the most are Ithan\'s and Tharion\'s. I\'m sorry but they were a snoozefest except for a few scenes.I\'m happy with what Ithan became and the resolution he got towards the end of the book, but the whole Fendyr/Reaper storyline wasn\'t all that interesting. At least I got more of Jesiba who also has her own very interesting backstory.Also, totally rooting for him and Perry.Tharion\'s chapters didn\'t get interesting to me until Sathia came into the picture. It\'s painful to see him make one miserable decision after another. It\'s like Sarah testing how much can one character fuck up.Sathia was a delightful surprise, I didn\'t expect Flynn\'s sister who made her seem to be nothing but trouble come off as a compelling character. I hope we get her POV in CC4. I want to explore a Fae female\'s POV who lived among the Fae and how their views and treatment of females turned her into who she is and how she can move on from it.I\'m a big fan of marriage of convenience trope so I\'ll consume all of it (if SJM manages to make Tharion more likable).Flynn (and his sprites), Declan, Baxian played important roles and I still adore them. I just can\'t help but think of how Baxian will live on without his mate Danika, it hurts.I was totally bamboozled by who Hunt\'s father is, let\'s just say he was conceived through team effort. He has three dads.Moving on to the villains:I\'ll start with the character that had the most satisfying death and it\'s Pollux. Lidia the female that you are. It was perfection.I didn\'t like how the Autumn King and King Morven of Avallen were off\'ed. It felt too convenient and I wanted a more satisfying resolution between Bryce/Ruhn and the Autumn King. He can get killed all over again for all I care, I just hoped it would be under a different scenario.Good riddance Sabine is dead.I expected something more in the final confrontation with the Asteri but it wasn\'t as epic as I expected it to be. I mean I\'m glad they\'re gone but I don\'t know... it was too easy. I don\'t think it even took 50 pages to off them.I felt like every villain was eliminated way too easily and way too conveniently. I think it would\'ve been better to spread out their deaths between HOSAB and HOFAS.I\'m glad that we saw Aidas, Apollion, and Thanatos but I was hoping for an epic battle between them and the Asteri. That one was too quick.There is one trope Sarah likes to pull in the climax but I\'m getting bored of it because she did it too many times to the point it no longer is impactful as it intends to be.Another thing that threw me off was shift between different character POVs mid chapter which felt like a whiplash and needed better formatting. To me I don\'t think Sarah is weak when it comes to writing multiple POVs (look at Throne of Glass), but for some reason it didn\'t have a smooth flow in this book.Overall, I did enjoy parts of book but Sarah took a big risk with the crossover.Though will say I\'m left with questions like:• What happened to the comms Crystal Ruhn gave Bryce before she escaped to Prythian?• What about all the Thurr connections and comparisons to Hunt?• What\'s the point of Ariadne and her dragon flame being able to burn even Princes of Hel?• Did we just forget about Viktoria?• Octartis (the Asteri) was a female in HOSAB, but in HOFAS it\'s a male?There are obvious continuity errors, typos and inconsistencies this book suffered from.Don\'t let my review impact your experience with this book or your rating, I love these characters and this world and I will miss them dearly but I always planned to keep my review transparent when it comes to this book. Sarah is one of my all-time favorite authors and half of her books are 5-stars to me so you\'ll know it will take a lot to sway me from that rating.I will definitely revisit these books in the future, I have attachment issues with Sarah\'s books.I will end this review with my favorite quote in HOFAS that made me sob even harder the moment I read it because of what it meant to these characters and to me.The friends they’d made were what mattered in the end. Not the enemies.Through love, all is possible.Thank you Sarah for another emotional journey I\'m forever grateful for the stories and the characters you always gift us ❤️'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3⭐️ Definitely had its moments but it wasn’t my favorite.***This review containsSPOILERSso if you have not read HOFAS or the previous books in the series, STOP SCROLLING ***PS: If you want to read the bonus chapters, I have them ALL on my story highlights on Instagram @thebiglittlelibrary 🫶 My favorites are Target\'s & BAM\'s!...Here\'s a fun, little summary of what happens:✨ ACOTAR crossover✨ Bryce eats a magic bean✨ Middengard Worm cameo✨ History lesson with a ghost✨ Nesta slayyyyyys✨ Tharion is an idiot✨ Baxian gets hungry in the dungeons✨ Ithan packs one hell of a punch✨ Lidia Cervos serves cunt✨ Boring Quinlar reunion✨ ""We All Live In A Yellow Submarine"" 🎶✨ Lidia\'s is legit Mother✨ Lots of sad boi energy✨ Hunt has a wardrobe malfunction 🍆✨ Asteri just being their usual asshole selves✨ Hypaxia is . . . there✨ “Don’t Fear The Reaper” 🎶✨ A random arranged marriage✨ Hel is DTF with an alliance✨ Hunt learns he was a test tube baby✨ Parricide 👏✨ Avallen gets a makeover✨ Bryce becomes death✨ Ithan nuts up✨ Hypaxia cures COVID✨ Epic final battle✨ Hel + sprites to the rescue✨AelinLidia serves even more cunt✨ Pollux gets fucked✨ ""Super Massive Black Hole"" 🎶✨ Bryce takes a trip to space✨ Hunt becomes Iron Man✨ Jesiba pulls a Ben Solo✨ Happily Ever After✨ My Little Pony reboot✨ House of Many Waters COMING SOON featuring Tharion (and Ithan)My Thoughts:Was it a bad story? No. But was it the best? No. There were things I liked and didn\'t like. I\'ll be going over all of it. So buckle the fuck up because this is going to be one hell of a review.First, I want to address the ACOTAR crossover.Honestly, I\'m indifferent about it all. I was surprised we mostly see Bryce interacting with just Nesta and Azriel, but I wasn\'t mad about it. I actually liked Bryce and Nesta\'s interactions and could DEFINITELY see them as friends under different circumstances. But honestly, Nesta was the best part of this entire crossover. Even after ACOSF I wasn’t a huge Nesta fan but after this, I really like her. I enjoyed seeing her from a total stranger\'s perspective!The entire point of the crossover was learning about Theia and her connection to the ACOTAR world - and it did its job there. HOWEVER, knowing that Hel knew the same history and could have easily shared this with Bryce is where my problem with the crossover comes in. If Hel had stepped in to give Bryce all the information (which Aidas says he didn\'t do because \'Bryce wasn\'t ready\'), there would be no need for a crossover. I mean, I guess at some point she’d have to visit the Fae world to absorb Silene’s Starborn power, but I believe it could have been done without even seeing any of the ACOTAR characters. Which pretty much makes me believe SJM did this as a fan service and/or as a way to get fans who haven\'t read CC, to read it. It was a genius marketing strategy, but I don\'t think it did much for the story. And unfortunately, I’m hearing from quite a few people that the crossover disappointed them. So, in the end, it may have backfired on SJM. But if you enjoyed the crossover, I\'d like to know and hear your thoughts on why. 😊What I liked:The overall plot.Listen, I gotta give it to SJM, she sure knows how to weave a story together. It\'s wild to me that even the smallest of details tend to have some significance later on in the story - things you may not have even realized are of any importance at all. I enjoyed the journey we\'ve been on since book one, and I thought how everything came together by the end was phenomenal.The insanity and possibilities of the Maasverse.I am still reeling from all the connections Midgard has to the worlds of ACOTAR and TOG. We mostly focus on the connections to the ACOTAR realm (the Fae home world) but we get some bits and pieces of the ties to the TOG realm thanks to the stories from Aidas and Jesiba. I am honestly in awe of how Sarah J. Maas is able to keep all this information straight and continue to build upon it. This is what I really admire and respect about the Crescent City series. From a fantasy standpoint, I think it was incredibly well done. This is a complex world with a complex history and magic system that can definitely be understood by a first time reader, but is probably appreciated more by those who\'ve read her other series. I\'m excited to see what Sarah does next in terms of connecting these worlds in the future.History lessons with Theia\'s daughter, Silene.This was so freaking cool. I absolutely LOVED learning more about our beloved ACOTAR world as well as the beginnings of Midgard and the role the Asteri played in all of it. It was a lot darker than I expected, which made it that much more interesting. The only thing I predicted beforehand was that the Prison was the Dusk Court, but besides that everything else was new information and super fun to learn about!Lidia mother-fucking Cervos.She is a baddie. Period. End of story. The things she\'s done. . . the things she\'s put herself through for years all for the sake of her sons. . . I\'m in awe. Lidia is the definition of strength. Her backstory was so heartbreaking. I legitimately cried. The way she sacrifices her entire being (mind, body, and soul) really reminded me of the way Rhys sacrificed himself while under the mountain. Both these characters put on a mask and became monsters in order to protect the ones they love. Even how they act after they are free and deal with the trauma is very similar. There\'s a lot of parallels between the two, which is why I probably love them both so much. Honestly, Lidia is my favorite character of the entire series and I wish we\'d gotten more time with her. Also, the fact she’s a descendent of King Brannon from the TOG world and therefore related to Aelin and Dorian in some way was not a surprise but super cool nevertheless.Lidia and Ruhn\'s romance.These two have my whole heart. 🫶 I absolutely ADORE them! They\'re probably my second favorite mated couple besides Feysand. They went through absolute hell in this book. Ruhn getting tortured and Lidia having to participate was so hard to stomach. Lidia saving Ruhn\'s life and nearly dying only for him to say“You’re dead to me,”made me want to scream. And finding out Lidia has children and her real motives for being the Hind absolutely broke my heart. 😭 They endure so much in such a short amount of time, and even though there was so much broken trust between them, they\'re able to accept the past and be there for one another. Lidia and Ruhn deserved their HEA. And if you haven\'t yet, RUN to the link in my bio at @thebiglittlelibrary and read their bonus chapter because it is so perfect!Ithan\'s character arc and story development.Did his rise to power feel a bit random and rushed? Yes. But I didn\'t expect it, so I liked that his story wasn\'t predictable - especially when he kills Sigrid by punching her through the throat. I GASPED so hard. lol Ithan was actually someone who really annoyed me in book two - he was immature and seemed lost - but his guilt for killing Sigrid takes him on a journey that ends with him coming into his own and finding his purpose as Prime. He grew up a lot and I honestly wouldn\'t be mad about seeing more of his story in future CC books. I\'m also excited by the fact he has the elemental power of snow! Just another connection to the TOG world.What I didn\'t like:The multiple, mid-chapter POV changes DROVE ME NUTS.This was probably my biggest issue. Most of the chapters had three different POVs. And at the beginning of the book, there were four main plots happening at the same time: Bryce in the Fae home world; Hunt, Ruhn, and Baxian being tortured, Tharion with the Viper Queen, and Ithan and the other random side characters trying to figure out wtf to do. So each chapter, we\'d follow one character and just as things were starting to ramp up, we\'d shift to another character in a completely different situation. Because of these constantly changing POV, the story didn\'t flow well and I wasn\'t able to truly immerse myself. I felt removed while reading. Maybe if each chapter had only focused on one, maybe two (max) POVs, the story might not have felt so disjointed.The predictable ending.While I enjoyed the Asteri plot, I thought the ending was predictable and incredibly low stakes (since you know no one important is going to actually die and stay dead). This could be because I\'ve read SJM\'s other series and have noticed some patterns and similarities to how she writes her endings. The allying with the \'dark\' forces of Hel, the sprites showing up last minute, the Lidia and Pollux confrontation, and Bryce dying and coming back to life, felt similar to the end of ACOWAR. And while the ending had a different plot, the familiarity of it all didn\'t allow for me to feel any surprise. It definitely wasn\'t a bad ending . . . I just didn\'t really pull me in.The story is plot heavy with not enough character / relationship growth.There was too much going on plot-wise with too many different storylines and too many POVs. While everything neatly came together in the end, the journey to get there was messy and overly complex. I think SJM could have found a way to simplify the plot and cut some POVs to make this easier to digest. But at the same time, because there was so much focus on the plot, a few of the characters and relationships didn\'t get the attention they deserved. Specifically, Hunt and Ruhn dealing with the trauma from their torture, Lidia dealing with her trauma, Ruhn and Lidia\'s relationship (see below), Ithan\'s and his character arc, and Tharion as a whole because what growth has he even gone through throughout this entire series?Not only did Ruhn and Lidia not get enough screen time to truly work through their trauma, trust issues, and anger, but THEY WERE ROBBED of a beautiful romance journey.(Sort of how we were robbed of more Elorcan in TOG.) I totally get the need for more plot in this book because it\'s the ending to the series and things need to wrap up. However, we barely scratched the surface of Ruhn and Lidia\'s romance in HOSAB. And then in this book, things are bad for a while before they come together without spending adequate time resolving any issues, healing from their traumas, and growing as a couple. I understand that it wasn\'t possible to do this in an already 838 page book, but I truly believe other things should have been cut to make their story more impactful. Or, I think they shouldn\'t have been a couple at the end so we\'d get a book that focuses on Ruhn and Lidia. Regardless, I think not diving deep into their story was a missed opportunity.Hunt and Bryce\'s \'reunion\'.This was one of the most anticlimactic scenes in the entire book. I was expecting Hunt and Bryce to immediately jump into each other\'s arms . . . to sob . . . to kiss . . . and say some incredibly romantic and sappy shit to one another. BUT NONE OF THAT HAPPENS. After everything they went through to find each other again, this was not the reunion I was hoping for.Hunt and Bryce as a coupleListen, I don\'t want to get into it but I don\'t think they have chemistry. Compared to SJM\'s other couples, they\'re definitely one of the weaker pairings. I get that in the story, they supposedly have this insane connection that spans across time and space, but I just never felt it. Side note: I LEGIT forgot they were married. 😂If you like Bryce and Hunt (and the rest of the Crescent City characters), I believe you\'ll really enjoy this story. But if you\'ve struggled to like or even connect with most of them, this story will probably disappoint you.Unfortunately, I fall in the latter group. As a whole, I think the CC characters are a bunch of immature idiots who act more like the stereotypical frat guys and sorority girls than people capable of saving the world. I mean, the majority of the characters are in their 20s but even the ones who are older still act childish at times.Bryce.I\'m sorry, but she\'s my least favorite SJM FMC. She\'s a selfish, immature, pick-me girl. If I had to read another sentence about how hot she was according to EVERY SINGLE GUY besides her brother, and listen to more of her shitty jokes (which EVERY SINGLE GUY thinks is so fucking funny), I was going to scream. And I get Bryce is a sarcastic bitch to everyone, but there\'s a time and a place for everything, and being obnoxious doesn\'t ever actually get anyone anywhere.Bryce also isn\'t a character that earned my respect as The Chosen One. Let\'s look at the origins of SJM\'s other main FMCs. Feyra was a hunter and Aelin was an assassin, while Bryce was . . . a party girl? The other FMCs proved themselves to be worthy of being the Chosen One but Bryce had zero skills to qualify her as a fighter or good leader yet somehow she was able to amass a group of people to follow her. Also, she never learned new skills. She solely relied on her inherited powers and the skills of others. Nepotism at its finest.Bryce was incredibly selfish when she unleashed an Asteri onto the Fae home world without a second thought for the millions of lives there . . . all because she wants answers, which she doesn’t really even get! Thank the Cauldron Nesta was there to save the day! And then, when Bryce tells Hunt, her supposed soulmate, to sack up and get over his trauma. Girl, WHAT?!Lastly, Bryce hating ALL fae because she’s had some bad experiences with a few seems incredibly close minded and just plain stupid. What about the fae in her life like Ruhn, Declan, Flynn and countless others who are kind and fight for what’s right? Apparently they don’t count. But how dumb is she to write off an entire race/species based on the actions of a few?Tharion.I didn\'t care for him in book one. I disliked him in book two. And I absolutely hate him in book three. I mean, does ANYONE like Tharion? Please, if you do, let me know in the comments and tell me why because I must be missing something. From what we\'ve seen, he is a selfish, immature, fuck boi that doesn\'t go through any character growth throughout this ENTIRE series. I was extremely annoyed that his POV took up a huge chunk of this book when it added little to this story. But it looks like SJM was mainly setting things up for him (and Ithan) to be the MCs in her next CC book. 🙄 I know I\'ll read it because it\'s SJM, but I won\'t be happy about it. He better undergo a serious transformation, like Nesta in ACOSF, or else that\'ll be the end of my CC journey.So many side characters that don\'t matter.Declan and Flynn.Okay, Declan\'s THE tech guy who only has use whenever SJM needed someone to hack something. How convenient. 🙄 But Flynn . . . I CANNOT for the life of me remember anything useful he did.Baxian.He\'s Danika\'s mate. Cool. And? I guess he\'s a hunk of meat that Bryce can call on during a fight. But as a character, he\'s not THAT special.Sigrid.She had so much potential but only propelled Ithan\'s character arc forward. Super pointless but probably setting up for the next book.Sathia.The most random of all characters. She pops up out of nowhere (I genuinely forgot Flynn had a sister) and married Tharion? This has to be a setup for the next book, but it just added another unnecessary piece to an already overly complicated story.Fury and Juniper.Bryce\'s ONLY female friends and I forgot about them lol. The fact Fury doesn\'t play an active role in this series is another missed opportunity. What\'s the point in Bryce having a badass friend if she doesn\'t even help??? I truly believe Sarah could and should have cut out a few of these people to simplify the story.Aidas\' reason for not just telling Bryce the entire truth about everything was flimsy.Apparently, it\'s because ""Bryce wasn\'t ready"". He couldn\'t risk her telling the wrong person and the Asteri finding out. So instead, he\'d rather have Bryce go on an insane goose chase and risk her life doing a bunch of other dangerous shit because he didn\'t think he could tell her the truth and convince her to keep her mouth shut. This entire situation just brought up my PTSD from when Danika withheld the truth from Bryce. Riddle me this, how is it that someone who no one seems to trust ends up with the most power and becomes the savior of Midgard??I also found it strange that Hel, a realm that has been trying to eradicate the Asteri for 15,000 years from Midgard and is currently helping other realms fight these beings, are fine sitting back, letting millions, if not, billions die throughout the years. From what I remember, after the initial rebellion with Theia, they tried helping once by creating the Thunderbirds. But that was eons ago and I don\'t believe they really tried since. It\'s like they were fine waiting till one of Theia\'s heirs was ready to take on the mantle and become the catalyst for a successful rebellion. But again, once they found Bryce, they didn\'t do shit to help her understand her powers or the history of Midgard and the Asteri. Ugh. Why??? There just isn\'t a good enough reason. So overall, I think Hel not stepping in more didn\'t make sense for a realm that is \'eager\' to help the universe, but also Aidas not revealing the whole truth earlier was such a cop-out and made Hel\'s entire involvement useless until it was convenient for the story.Overall, House of Flame and Shadow was an okay conclusion to the Crescent City series. I enjoyed how everything came full circle and how SJM scratches the surface of the multiverse. Sarah J. Maas is still one of my favorite authors, and even though this may not have been my favorite book, I respect the hell out of her and admire her. She\'s created some of the most magical worlds and stories that have changed a generation of readers, so she\'ll always hold a special place in my heart. I am excited for the next ACOTAR book, but I do hope she does what she does best and gives us a story with the perfect combination of a compelling plot, character growth, and romance. And for the love of god please don’t let it have more than 2 POVs.Favorite Quotes:“You’re as much of a monster as they are.”“Love will do that to you.”_______For Bryce, home was - and always would be - Hunt._______“You’re a prince, start acting like one.”_______“I don’t fucking care who you are, so long as you’re mine.

Because it\'s 1 AM and tomorrow 5 of my bookish friends are coming to spend the weekend at my place, I\'m going to post some of my raw notes because I don\'t want to leave you hanging. The plan is to come back on Monday and edit these into something easier to read lol. Don\'t expect these to be in an order that makes sense.

Not to mention that this series was supposed to be about female friendships. We just, do away with fury and juniper altogether in this book. Stupid. Also, Fury literally makes a scoff about how all she’s doing is playing babysitter and I was like UH YEAH. THE FUCK?JesibaThere should have been breadcrumbs. We should have seen her interact with SOMEONE who knows Appolion *ahem, Aidas* and had her trash talk him. Then we’d be like what’s her beef?Book of breathings/library of parthosbig old plot hole. Disappointing.reunion between Bryce and Huntone of the things that made me SO ANGRYYYYYY like in the moment I was walking around saying “the fuck??? Wait WHAT???” I don’t see Pete for 24 hours and I will leap into that man’s arms. You’re telling me that *mates* who’ve been tortured and never knew if they’d find their way back to one another were going to like the fucking Ocean Queen stop them from falling into each other’s arms??? You cannot tell me they shouldn’t have been sobbing together. bullshit.Lack of character dev.I was surprised by this. I expected the book to at least take place over the course of a month, not like, a week. I get we don’t tend to change as humans thaaaaat much over a week but it\'s historically been something I appreciate that in her writing and we got none of it.Silene / Princes of Hel info dumpsI could go on and on here, but in essence, it’s bloody infuriating that there were people who knew everything all along and never guided or drop-fed that info to us over the three books. “You weren’t ready” I WANTED TO THROW MY PHONE what a cop-out. Secondly, by sharing all this info all at once, the reader doesn’t get to chew on any of it, the think about what it means. We’re just hanging on for dear life trying to take it all in. It’s like someone tossing us a ball… versus having a cannon full of tennis balls shot at you all at onceGeneral messiness/she bit off more than she could chewWhen I’m over here wishing that she’d kill some characters off, just so that we could have some emotional impact AND narrow the field, we’ve got a big problem. I think about Chekov’s Gun all the time when I’m reading… the rule in writing that if you include an element, you should use it by the book’s conclusion. And she just… doesn’t. I’ve never been more convinced than I am now after HoFaS that SJM doesn’t actually have some crisp master plan. She just leaves a fuck-tonne of Chekov’s Guns lying around, and picks them up willy nilly when it sort of works in a future book. That’s why it feels so messy, plot-hole-y, and just kind of ???the (anti)climaxthe whole final fight scene was anticlimactic, it never felt like anyone was actually in danger, and legit in all caps I was fuuuuuuming about the bringing her back to life. Nah. I’m fucking sick of it. Death is there for a reason. Get rid of it and you have NO stakes. Which makes all your hard work trying to get the reader to be worried about the character’s wellbeing null and voidOther things that made me real mad:•\u2060 \u2060what was the point in the viper queen getting a private fight between Sigrid and Ithan????•\u2060 \u2060\u2060SIGRID. are you fucking kidding me all of that round and round in circles and FOR WHAT.•\u2060 \u2060\u2060Ithan choosing to try to bring Sigrid back from the dead (reaper form) instead of focusing on what’s ACTUALLY important aka THE FIGHT OF THEIR LIFE WITH THE BIG BAD?????•\u2060 \u2060\u2060Bryce opening the coffin. why she acting like a dumb bitch? I literally wrote down: “????? Girl why so reckless”•\u2060 \u2060\u2060over promising and under-delivering: don’t make it seem like we’re going to get any face time with the acotar crew only to give us two of them•\u2060 \u2060\u2060The parasite is something they should have learned in the previous book.

They’re supposed to heal quickly, so which is it?? She’s spent over a decade in an abusive relationship with Pollux, so because he walked with her sons for a bit they’re just fine with it? Nahhhh fuck that. They shouldn’t have ended up back together by the end of this book and we should have gotten him making ALL the amends, her fighting with herself to learn how to trust him again, etc in the next book. THATS the character growth I want to see. ughhhhhh I’m still so mad lol.•\u2060 \u2060\u2060all that nonsense about to join or not join the blades… and she can simply summon the void herself???Lastly, and possibly most hilariouslysomething that didn’t really matter but spoke to how inconsistent SJM was with her own established rules: WHY DID IT TAKE RHYS 80 YEARS TO GET TO THE HOUSE OF WIND? TWIIIIIIIICE? He has literally winnowed just outside the wards and flown inside in a matter of seconds/like, a minute. He does it when Nesta is stuck in that nightmare in ACOSF. and TWICE we get oooooo he’s coming. look at that encroaching darkness. ooooo you better go. (proceeds to have a long, heartfelt goodbye with mom hugs) *closes portal before he ever arrives* bsffr.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""When you manage your expectations by being realistic and enjoy tf outta this masterpiece 😌🤭SPOILER FREE REVIEWI honestly feel so emotional finishing this book, saying goodbye to Bryce and Hunt's story. I was thoroughly entertained, invested and satisfied with the way this book was written. I would say that when you go into this book,please keep in mind you're reading Bryce's story, simply put you are going in for Captain Marvel and not Avengers Endgame 🤷\u200d♀️I also see people disappointed with the way Bryce was in this book.Even though she had few moments where I felt frustrated with her, I fully understood her. In a strange environment, she is not going to or supposed to act calm. She will be paranoid. Meeting new people whom SHE doesn't know and acting suspicious, trying to escape makes ABSOLUTE sense. Even in her irrational actions, there were rational intentions 👀Coming back to the book which is divided into Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3 like any other Crescent City book.Part 1explored more folklore, history, new places and people (for Bryce) and setting up a much more powerful world building. I found myself loving it, there were some big reveals and connections. I was also shocked to see one of the creatures back in the world and it brought intense memories. It also ends on a brutal note. Iykyk.Part 2was more hands on action, it built on to the reveals made in part 1 brilliantly. I see MANY people saying that this part bored them and dragged on. On the contrary, I found it to be much more intense and mind blowing. Lidia and Ruhn carried it beautifully. Part 2 ends on a very nerve wrecking note, and you'll immediately want to binge the rest of the book.Part 3was simply put- Binge worthy. Big reveals happen here, characters in this world get what they deserve and I ate it up. Ithan and Bryce were my favorite here, and surprisingly Jesiba too. It ends on a satisfying note and I just can't wait to see how it's going to add up to the future books.Onto the characters-❤️\u200d🔥Bryce-Although a bit erratic her actions are completely justified imo. She is the same Bryce we have grown to love- smartass, funny, badass, always standing up for the right and calculating. The sacrifices she's willing to make was emotional to see. But like any other, she does have flaws and is imperfect.⚡Hunt-My man. The way he cared for Bryce was everything. Even while getting tortured to the point where he is close to death, all he cared about was Bryce and his friends. He would do anything to protect them, even if it means he's gonna end up hurt. His big reveal was one that I was never expecting and I was shook. I loved seeing him unleash and put Celestina in her place.🔥Lidia-I LOVE her. She did so much for literally everyone good in this book, such huge sacrifices. She did not put herself first once and I loved her. I swear I just want to give her the biggest hug.🖤Ruhn-Loved seeing the way he felt for Lidia. Man's had me gasping, crying, emotional for more. His bond with Hunt and Baxian was intense and so loyal. The way he was protecting Bryce was everything. Tho that one scene made me dizzy (you know which one).🐺Ithan and 🧜\u200d♂️Tharion-Although different paths, I found them to be quite similar with the way they deal with their struggles. Before anyone gets frustrated with these two- Have you ever made a mistake and in order to correct it desperately, you make more bad decisions and more mistakes?? That sounds pretty relatable to me. Not all of us are perfect. Living in self loathing, guilt, and anxiety isn't easy. Tharion and Ithan thinking that they don't deserve anything good happening to them after making so many mistakes is real and it's amental health representation at its best.So many people acting like Tharion and Ithan were annoying breaks my heart cause I found them to be so endearing and loving, so loyal, so worthy despite what the two thought. I just wish to hold them and talk to them about it all.Baxian-All I'll say is he has strong teeth 😭Jesiba and Hypaxia-I appreciated so much what these two did, especially Jesiba. Without giving too much away, am sure you'll like them more.The romances-Bryce and Hunt-Honestly, after Feyre and Rhys these two are my favorite SJM couple and they are immensely underrated. Even in their arguments, they know when to support each other. They're the couple who will support each other in public even if they are wrong and correct the other in private.Ruhn and Lidia-So angsty. It's like they broke my heart multiple times and mended it to complete perfection. Literally everything about them is PERFECT. I loved how they communicated and bared themselves to each other.Also, did SJM throw in the marriage of convenience trope? 👀Y'all gotta find out for which couple, no spoilers here. 🤭🤭I believe people have forgotten that this is Bryce's story. In order to enjoy this book, you gotta keep that in mind. I can already see that SJM has foreshadowed a lot of multiversal possible scenarios. Hopefully she'll explore them on an Endgame level someday.But for now, am excited to see where the Crescent City series will go from here 😉 I highly recommend reading this series after ToG and ESPECIALLY ACOTAR.I did not want this to end, I could still read another 500 pages of this beautiful book and world. Already can't wait to reread 😭❤•~•~IT'S FINALLY HERE 😍😍 In all it's glory 🥹🥹~•~•~Am so ready for Jan 2024""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'The weakest conclusion to an SJM series by far. This book was one big deus ex machina clusterfuck. But I think most fans will overlook the huge issues in this book because we get to see some old favourite characters.Let\'s start off with the good parts:- Lidia Cervos 🧎🏻\u200d♀️🧎🏻\u200d♀️🧎🏻\u200d♀️Few characters had any agency in this book. Lidia was one of the few people who actually made a difference in this book. She really stole the show from Bryce and Hunt.- In the same vein as Lidia, Nesta lit up every scene she was in. Every scene she was in, I only noticed her. She really carried every part of the story she touched and she is so fun.- And obviously the entire Prythian part because those characters are elite. Loved the lore drop we got.- There was a particular scene with a few characters waving at each other that broke my heart.Now on to the bad:- Welcome to the Bryce Quinlan Show, where I spent 50% of the book asking myself ""Why are Tharion/Flynn/Declan/Sathia/Hunt/Ruhn even in this scene??"". So much of this book involved Bryce and Co. going somewhere to do something. But they all could have been Bryce\'s solo missions because it literally would not have made a difference if her companions weren\'t there. I think this was made particularly evident because there were 3 or 4 times where Bryce had to relay stuff she had done in the previous chapters to her group of friends. Because her friends weren\'t doing anything. The side characters felt soooo unnecessary in so many points in this book.- Another note on Bryce, she has some smart moments in the book but so much of her dominance is because she is The Chosen One. Everything she gains is because she is related to XYZ and has ABC in her blood. It makes it really hard to root for her because she didn\'t have to earn anything.- As I already mentioned in HOSAB, Bryce is only interesting in the context of Danika. By herself, she isn\'t that particularly interesting or someone I would root for. I think the strongest part about her was her friendship to Danika. This is particularly evident when anything happens between Hunt and Bryce. They just don\'t have that much chemistry tbh. I really wish this series had been about Bryce and Danika. Hunt really felt like a side piece. I really dgaf about this man.- I can\'t believe I had to read about Hunt going commando because his d**k is too big to fit into his underwear. I actually wanted to gouge my eyes out. 🤢😵\u200d💫😵 Also Hunt and Bryce getting handsy while their friends were fighting for their lives? Why were Ruhn and Lidia trying to get it on while their friends were literally right beside them in the cave? The most unnecessary scenes that were added just so this book can be spicy.- Ithan LOLOLOL. If you look up ""filler character"" he would be the #1 offender. He actually didn\'t do anything in this book for the first 70% and then he suddenly just have everything happen to him. His rise in power was the most eye-rolling experience because he doesn\'t deserve any of this.- Tharion sorry babes I wish I had skipped every scene you were in. I actually do not give a fck about this man. Suddenly Sathia appears. What did she even add to the story? Tharion and Ithan were the two most ridiculous characters in this book. I\'m actually so mad both of them got so much ""screen time"". But Tharion might get the ""Nesta"" treatment because it is clear his story isn\'t over.- In true SJM fashion, we get the ""We could have told you all of this in Book 1 but you weren\'t ready so we are just going to explain everything now"". I\'m so sick and tired of important information being gatekept for the sake of having a plot.- I want SO MUCH MORE grovelling between Ruhn and Lidia. I wanted the angst and yearning and the hurt x comfort. They are by far the best couple in this series.- LOOOL COOPER. Why did we focus so much on Sophie and Emilie in book 2 for them to basically not matter at all.- Sigrid and Ariadne felt like loose ends. Perhaps they will be important in future books but they took up too much time in this book for them to not matter much at the end.- OK, so book 1 had that big dramatic massacre, which really got my hopes up that SJM would actually commit to some gruesome ends for some of her main characters. SYKE! I\'m so tired of none of the characters actually being in danger.- Hypaxia exists to be a deus ex machina. Her and Jesiba\'s sole purpose in the series is to get people out of a pickle. They literally didn\'t serve any other purpose.- Also where were Juniper and Fury? They were completely neglected except for one scene.- While writing this, I just remembered I haven\'t even mentioned Baxian. That just shows how insignificant he was in every scene he was in. He just gets lumped in with Hunt and Co.- The Harpy comes back for her to get KO\'d in 0.2 seconds?- Hypaxia defeats a certain character very quickly. It felt so out of left field and rushed.Overall, this book felt sloppy.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'The harder you rise, the harder you fall. Sarah J Maas wrote her own kill switch to the “Maasverse” and activated it when this was published.Disappointed does not even sum up the entirety of how I’m feeling. For those people who are really enjoying and loving this, I am so happy for you, and I wish that was the case for me. But I am just glad to have finished it so I never have to think about it again. Long live the Crescent City duology. I am envious of the characters who got to die in HOSAB/HOEAB so they didn’t have to experience HOFAS and the defamation of character that touched every single character I had previously cared about and rendered them boring, two dimensional and soulless.For a book “millions of fans” have been waiting for for two years, Sarah did not deliver. She did not even purchase a postage label. The epic conclusion to the crescent city trilogy, which had so much potential, was reduced into a messy concubine of soap opera, unwanted comedy and minimal stakes. There was so much potential. So much potential and this is what we got. I am so angry.The writing in this book leads me to believe Sarah no longer cares about Lunathion, or her characters. This book is a testament to laziness, loss of passion and the arrogance of knowing no matter what she wrote, she would be making money.Through love all is possible… yet there was no love in this book. It was rendered impossibly cold and distant from anything else she could have possibly written. Through “convenient coincidences”, all is possible, should be her new slogan.I don’t even understand how in any stage of production, anyone at bloomsbury could confidently look at this and not question the drastic changes to characters, such as Bryce’s complete tyrannical selfishness, and Hunt’s stripped down personality and so on and so on. HOFAS was a failure and nothing more.Due to my disappointment at the entire picture, I could not even bring myself to be excited when certain plot points; which I would have screamed at, were unravelled, they felt anticlimactic and convenient at best. The the potential Sarah carefully constructed in not only the last two books, but the small sprinkles of lore throughout all her books, remains completely untapped and unused. Fans and theorists could have patched together a better ending to this series and (as someone who grew distasteful of theorists and did not look forward to a crossover) I’ve seen theorists who care more and know more and understand more of Sarah’s precious worlds than she seemingly did in this book.I am so so so angry. Sarah chose convenience, palatable and cheap shock factor over writing something meaningful. I can only guess this comes from the fact that “fame” has gotten to her head. Sarah has done a disservice to long standing fans in an attempt to suck in and appeal to celebrities and influencers, blending epic backstories and well planned out history into grey palatable mush that can be consumed by the masses, instead of the quality book it could have been to be consumed by the people that make this all possible for her.Even her regular fashion of fast paced, “epic” final 100 pages could not overcome first 700 pages of convenience, low stakes nonsense. There was no slice of life, no character development, just a long endless cave of info dumping and convenience.Sarah’s best writing is a footnote in the past. Bloomsbury I am so so disappointed in you for allowing this, marketing this, profiting off this. House of Flame and Shadow is a mockery of everything good in fantasy and did not deserve our excitement, our hope, or our joy.I normally restrain myself from negative reviews, because I do believe all art is subjective and everyone has a right to enjoy art as it comes. But this was objectively bad and there are no excuses. There is no explanation. Someone as revered as Sarah J Maas should be doing better as she rises, not worse. I hope HOFAS/Sarah and the rightful people at bloomsbury receive the criticism this book deserves so that they can ensure future books do not suffer the same fate.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""By now I’m sure we’ve all seen the news for special editions. Everyone is excited for the Adriel, Nesta and Bryce chapter so clearly Walmart is the move right? Everyone is happy. And excited. And that’s fine and dandy.But let me ask you this.WHERE IS CASSIAN???????WHERE’S MY MAN IN ALL THIS!He wasn’t included as one of the people in the bonus chapters and no one is concerned!!Did we forget that Elain saw a vision of Cassian dying??Why are Nesta and Azriel together while Cassian isn’t there????I’m scared guys. This book isn’t out and I’m already stressed.First of all, if Hunt, Bryce, and Ruhn don't live happily ever after in this. We riot.Second, if we don't get an Avengers level team up in this book I'm suing for getting my hopes up. That ending killed and then revived me and I don't know how I'm going to wait for this.Third, get ready for some crackpot theories cause my brain is spiraling!!! I don't know anyone in real life who has read this book, or who is just as excited about any of this as I am, so I have no one to scream these at. Instead, I'll scream them at you all!- Rhys' last name is Danaan?????- Either that or Ruhn isn't actually the son of Autumn King since he's clearly a descendant from the Night Court (Bryce literally thought Rhys was Ruhn so clearly there's a blood relation, But like the Autumn king is clearly from the Autumn court???? pls give me theories!)- Azriel has major ties to fey in Lunathion since he had Truth Teller and was the one that casually found Bryce. I no longer believe in coincidence. Everything is suspicious. If the whole ACOTAR gang can't cross to Bryce's world, I think only Az might. (The starborn sword and his knife have to fight together.- Fury and Amren are related or have similar powers or are of the same species (they basically act the same and no one knows what Fury can actually do). Are they one of the Asteri's creations??? Like how the Asteri made the angels and mentioned creating prototypes for the angels in the previous world which I assume is what the Illyrians are????? Where Amren and Fury creations of theirs in another world??-Hunt is part Thunderbird (We're told that he was literally bred for something and his father is a mystery) Like clearly one of the princes is his father, but like, the guy can literally absorb and use energy which is pretty thunderbird-ish.- Hunt is going to literally just suck the energy out of the Asteri and that's how he'll kill them. (I kept thinking that's what the thunderbird was going to do and then that went nowhere).-Cormac isn't dead. (I've decided that I like him and so he can't die.)- Cormac's side of the family might be related to Aelin and her world.- The shifters obviously come from Aelin's world and the wolves are lowkey related Fenrys????- I don't think Aelin will make much of an appearance. (the girl is tired, she went through too much let her rest!)- If Aelin does show up, it'll be brief. (As I said, she's tired, she's not here to fight) But if she does, I really just want her, Bryce and Cassian to interact because the chaos and badassery they would bring would be unmatched.- Ruhn and Lidia are obviously mates. Because duh. (Also, I totally called her being Agent Daybright. I knew right from chapter one that Lidia would be a good guy when she threw Sofie into the water.) But anyway, she might have some connection to Aelin???? I just get a vibe from her.Feel free to tell me I'm crazy. At this point, I'm grasping at straws and I know it.""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Erm, it’s no from me.I’ve said this before and I’ll say it again:Sarah J. Maasownsmy ass.I don’t feel this level of obsession for any other author.But this book? Was a shit show. I’m so glad it’s over. 😓I don’t even had it in me to be sad about this. I just wanna hate. Respectfully.✨Incoming rant review! ✨NO spoilers. Just a general overview.The first half had me captivated. I loved being back with these characters, discovering the world and the lore. Things were exciting!But, the second half lost me completely. The amount of running plot points we had started to read scattered instead of it coming together.Bryce, honey? You can suck my dick.🙂Her character arc was so messy, it made no damn sense! 😑The development was not there. Instead of growing into her power, her knowledge with wisdom, with the support of others that are much more skilled and smarter than she is, that understand the political nuance of the world better than she does, she chose to act like a spoiled, entitled brat, had the nerve to call herself a leader, yet was acting on her own accord all the time.She was running on arrogance and recklessness. She read stupid. She became the ‘alphahole’ she kept complaining about.I don’t understand why this was the direction her character went in. I don’t know what SJM or her editors were thinking. Or am I not understanding things correctly?No, I’m not the problem here.Bryce ruined it.She read like a bootleg version of Aelinand it was embarrassing to read. 🙄At some point, I had enough of the world-building too. A lot of information was being revealed and it was not smoothly laid out or explored. It just kept being piled on top of one another and I got bored. I don’t want to be reading pages of it.The crossover was another thing that was so poorly and boringly told. If you’re going to have a crossover, do it right. Incorporate the worlds together, because otherwise, why introduce it in the first place? The potential this aspect of the story had was squandered and fucked with. 😑Whilst I’m a fan of multiple POV’s, the constant switches here were making me dizzy. 🥴We had multiple perspectives within the SAME chapter. The paragraphs were too short. There was no time given to truly connect to their POV and immersive oneself in their struggles before we swiftly moved on to the next POV. I wish chapters were dedicated to them instead.This is by far my least favourite novel from SJM and now my least favourite series.This is not the SJM I’ve come to know and love. The one that creates found families like no other, romances like no other, mental health and trauma representation like no other with far tighter plots.I wasn’t expecting for my feelings to go in this direction. This was underwhelming and such a disappointment. I’m holding out hope that whenever the next book releases and I reread this*shudders*I’ll like it more? 😬I need ice cream.

I applaud her (yet again) for her ability to weave so many threads, characters and mythology into one insanely action packed tale.SPOILERS BELOW...I'm going to start with Bryce. I adore her. I feel like the theme of this book was ‘Level Up’, and she did this and then some. After all of the shit she went through in the previous books I loved see her step fully into her own.I’ve seen a few reviews criticising her character as being ‘insufferable’, which I find kind of interesting … mostly for the fact that when we judge something, it’s most often the thing that we don’t give ourselves permission to be or feel, or are judging within ourselves. As a collective, women have been taught to fear our own power, and here we’re presented with a fully fleshed, whole person that doesn’t feel the need to humble herself or shrink to make herself more relatable to others. Given the above, I get this can be polarising for some people who identify as female… but for me? I freaking LOVED this. The scene in particular between her and the two fae kings was so cathartic. SJM was really channelling some feminine rage and putting a metaphoric foot down against the patriarchy. Honestly, the amount of times I wish I’d been in a position to fight back like this… it was so wonderful to read.Bryce’s character arc across all three books felt right to me. The bit of tension between her and Hunt also felt valid - I could see things from both their sides and it felt true to their characters. Ultimately, Bryce was carrying the sole weight of being the key to destroying the Asteri, and her mental fortitude (while maybe it came across as being too headstrong at times) was needed in order for her to carry this out. Sorry not sorry.Onto Hunt - bless him, he really went through it in this book. I also thoroughly enjoyed his ‘Level Up’ towards the end. The romantic tension between he and Bryce was definitely higher in books 1 & 2 - here they were more in the ‘marriage phase’ of being a couple, which I guess is fine… although I wish we’d had a little bit more of a dramatic reunion / spice. Overall Hunt has always been a solid character in my mind.Lidia & Ruhn… I LOVE. They carried the romance in this book. Lidia was an incredible personality to work into the mix - she kind of reminds me a bit of Manon in that she’s not the FMC, but easily could be.Ithan - his scene with Connor had me sobbing. I had secretly hoped he’d end up as the Prime!Nesta - I’ve never been a massive fan of hers, but I was surprised by how much I enjoyed her in this book!. All of the snark and banter between her and Bryce was fantastic.Azriel - honestly, I’ve never gotten much from Az, and this book was no different. I think people project onto his personality (which is very quiet) and build stories about him in their own minds, because in reality we know very little about him, and he doesn't really speak that often. That being said, I loved the sweet moment between him and Nesta when he convinced her to take off the mask - it did mushy things to my heart.THE ENDINGI have no words except… what in the holy Interstellar!!? SJM can sure write a mind blowing action scene. So. Freaking. Amazing.THE ACOTAR CROSSOVERFor the most part, I was OK with how this panned out. There was always going to be a fine line between this remaining a Crescent City book vs turning into an ACOTAR take over.I think I would have liked just a **smidge** more from the interactions between Bryce and the gang - particularly with Rhys, Cassian and Feyre (who did not make an appearance at all.) It honestly felt like a Nesta x Crescent City crossover in the end, but I’m not mad about it. I am glad SJM stuck with the Crescent City POVs and that it stayed firmly a CC book.Furthermore, now that she has opened the connection between the two worlds, it leaves room for CC characters to cameo in future ACOTAR books which I wouldn’t object to in the slightest. And with the Starsword now back in Velaris… I’m sure it will come into play in future books.Side note: Randall & Ember’s bonus chapter - IDK why, but she continues to portray Rhys as an overbearing asshole? I just want the Rhys we know and love back.THE NEXT CRESCENT CITY BOOKI’d guess it will be a continuation of Tharion’s story. His journey in this book, was, essentially a retelling of The Little Mermaid - it would make sense for the next book given House of Many Waters is the remaining title. I think SJM put Tharion through the ringer in this book to lay the groundwork for a lot of character growth and redemption should his story continue. Maybe he and Ariadne are going to wind up together??Ithan's romance was also hinted at with Perry, but again there's a wide open space there so that's also another possibility.TO SUM UPI'm really sad this series is over, I've loved every second of it. <3""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Part One: The DropRuhn is pretty pissed at his girlfriend and our winged boys (feathers not leathers) aren’t doing great. Bryce is in a dungeon with a weirdly polite Rhys and friends but not the High Lady which seems not very “we are equals”-y. I had to Google Flynn because I could not remember who he was to save my life. Tharion is now a drug-addicted UFC fighter which I’ll call a step backwards. I have no idea where Syrinx is and this is very distressing. Nesta keeps being referred to as a warrior even though we all know that the biggest foe she’s ever faced is Cassian’s dick. Bryce’s Boob Star acts as MapQuest and Ithan accidentally kills someone he’s known for three days. Bryce finds out she hails from hella colonizers and then wakes up a haughty old bitch. Homeward bound! Azriel is apparently now the Nesta Whisperer?Part Two: The SearchBryce teleports into her dad’s office and he is a predictable dick about it. Ruhn, who asks to have his hand chewed off, is rescued alongside Hunt and Baxian and I cried. Lidia dies but this is a Sarah J. Maas book so she also un-dies. Ithan gets a job as an executive assistant in exchange for reanimating a corpse. Ruhn discovers that Lidia has little fawns and Hunt and Bryce reunite in a really unsatisfying way. You’ve heard of the Avatar, the master of all elements, now meet Hypaxia: The Fendyr-Bender. Bryce and the gang go treasure hunting on the island from MYST. There are many hieroglyphics and Hunt is a huge bitch while in Hel where he meets his dads. Ruhn kills their father (Vanserra boys take note), then Bryce sticks her sword in the floor of a cave and the land heals itself like the end of The Lion King.Part Three: The AscentSyrinx is with Bryce’s parents so everybody (me) can relax. The Asteri blew up a town square and killed a lot of people so Bryce decides to rip a hole in the space time continuum to get rid of them; perhaps they can be lured by a line of treats on the ground. Nesta just hands over her death Mask, which is totally like her and completely in-character. Bryce makes major decisions regarding other people without consulting them and isn’t sorry because deez nuts. Hunt decides he’s tired of his slave halo and just gets rid of it, I guess. Lidia is apparently Aelin’s granddaughter or something. Bryce sucks all the baddies into a void and then dies and comes back because SJM cannot stop writing anticlimactic endings. Nesta gets a nice hug. What happened to Tharion and his wife and the dragon and the dead alpha and the Viper Queen? What great questions that have no answers.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""1.)House of Earth and Blood★★★2.)House of Sky and Breath★★★♡ all 5 HOFAS bonus chapters:tumblr+redditthis was a reading experience, friends! after my content and trigger warnings, i will do a spoiler section of my thoughts because at this point in the sjm universe / maasverse, and this being the third book in the crescent city series, it is difficult to talk about anything without it being a potential spoiler!i had a good time reading this. I really loved lidia and ruhn’s storylines and they really made the entire book for me. I am also still so very in love with hypaxia, and the things i would do to get her pov. speaking of, I felt a little bored at some povs in hofas - mostly ithian and tharion (i am so sorry to these men, i love them and feel so much empathy for them, but it is true). and bryce’s pov made me feel a range of emotions, that’s for sure, but most of the time it wasn’t the best emotions. ultimately, i think there were too many povs in this book and sometimes the switching between them felt very jarring and unbalanced. i also feel like there was just so much going on, which valid, but instead of it being information that we started to learn in the first two books, it felt like sjm was kind of just throwing out every plot she could think up. and i think this all made the pacing of this book a bit weird feeling. but i did love that baldur’s gate unexpected cursed dot storyline a lot.like all sjm books, this could have been edited down a little bit (or a lot a bit). But i think what all sjm’s books do exceptionally well is discussion of trauma and grief and learning to live coinciding with those two very heavy things and also trying to heal from them, and how those healing paths can look very different for everyone. I feel like we can really see that in her crescent city series and it is always something that i will appreciate her putting out into the world.overall, i had a lot of fun reading this and making connections between all the things. if you follow my reviews, you will know how much i love theorycrafting and connecting different universes together, and this book truly took this experience to a different level. each easter egg truly felt like a long awaited gift i was finally able to open. and once i finished this last page, well… and all the bonus chapters, the anticipation i felt for whatever sjm does next was very surprising and a little unmatched. plus reading a new sjm book when it drops, with what feels like half of the online book community, feels special each and every new release.trigger + content warnings:death, grief, blood, captivity, slavery, extreme torture, a lot of violence, gun violence, maybe cannibalism / maybe just a lot of gore, battle, war, loss of a loved one in past (and a lot of talk about it), loss of sibling in past, defecation and urine mentions, self harm to get blood, sexual abuse, threat of rape, talk of forced breeding, talk of medical experimentation, talk of domestic abuse, talk of parental abuse, colonization, needles, bombings, a lot of talk and mentions of hurt children, vomit, a lot of talk of parasites, drugging / poisoning, self sacrifice / a lot of attempts at self sacrificingthis next section of this review will be filled with spoilers!please use caution!and please make sure you’ve read the entire throne of glass series and the entire a court of thorns and roses series!us finally getting the throne of glass crossover moment we have all been waiting for? I was truly screaming. lidia cervos, the woman you are. the stag throne, the hidden flame powers, the ruby ring, the blatant descendant name drop of whitethorn galathynius. i am still losing my mind while i type this. obviously bryce and ruhn being somehow related to rhysand is pretty cool. and i truly believe Ithan is a descendant of dorian because of the ice powers (and by the end of tog dorian was a shifter). but lidia being related to aelin? i am just speechless.lidia was the best character in this book for me, too. And she had the most heartfelt and empowering story going on throughout as well. and the naming of her one son brannon? truly, her and ruhn really were the stars of this third book and their povs were hands down my favorite. (that target bonus chapter? so good)okay more throne of glass crossover screaming - the under king! full credit toemmahalbrook on tiktok!but my jaw is still on the floor. i am just so excited to read reviews and find more crossovers that i missed, and to see all the crossover content that is still to come!my mind is still trying to process everything with theia and aidas (and helena and silene). i know rhysand is a descendant of theia and amren told him she was a prisoner of theia. But this book kind of makes it appear like amren was a captured “pet monster” of silene. i need to do more research but amren connecting all the gods and theia is really cool and something i think the fandom has been wanting more confirmation of for a really long time.okay back to crescent city, hypaxia was amazing, as always! i just love my sapphic necromancer queen. i know i made the baldur's gate joke above, but wizards of the coast are quaking at her finding the antidote to defeat the parasites and still finding ways to make it more easily accessible and forever lasting. she is actually the real mvp of this book.ruhn, hunt, and baxian going through some dark stuff and making jokes to keep light getting out of that dungeon. I actually really loved seeing their friendship in this book, even if… again, some dark stuff.i don’t want to talk about this, but ultimately i know i need to because i feel like this is the reason i am giving this book three stars, so let’s talk about it - bryce wasn’t my favorite in this book, sadly. her leaving cooper was just so cruel to me. i know many other reviewers are saying this, but bryce did so many things that made readers question that maybe she is turning into the villain (which might have been a little cool actually). but her leaving him behind was just wild to me. ember and randall showing they are upset because of this and voicing that bryce was wrong for leaving him still (or maybe even enhanced) made me so upset at her. But there were so many other instances too, like when she called lidia’s kids baggage? like when she told hunt to get over himself when the man was really going through it in those dungeons? what was all that? she felt so reckless and so careless and even heartless. ahhh i dont know, i just feel like bryce is easily my least favorite of sjm’s main characters, and i just liked her less and less each book, which feels so bad to say, but it really is how i feel.this is so random, but i also need to admit that i truly didn’t think cormac was dead dead, so i was so surprised when this book wrapped up and i guess that man really is! man oh man, i was truly waiting for that reveal and it just never came!okay, the ending! i loved seeing those three fire sprites truly saving the day. and them working at griffin antiquities at the end? oh, i really loved to see it. i shed many tears at jesiba actually saving the day, and i shed even more at bryce seeing danika and connor and everyone she loves waiting for her. and i did actually like the blackhole portal teleporting as well. the last 100 pages of this book were very strong and very heartfelt.and the very end? the way i truly wept at bryce's mom hugging and saying kind words to nesta. I actually felt insane with swollen eyes because of it. (the bam bonus chapter was probably my favorite of all the bonus chapters though. also, i just really want to live in the house of wind!) But yeah, i felt like this was a very strong ending to this book, and a very strong set up for whatever sjm does next! (probably with acotar now that nesta has the sword, dagger, mask, and a harp to potentially find bryce or whoever else whewwwww)lastly, because i cannot write a spoiler section review and not bring this up: when azriel said nyx is waiting too. oh, it got a tear from me. and bryce telling nesta and azriel how a phone works got a giggle from me. i truly cannot wait for whatever sjm gives us next.the acotar reread really came in clutch, especiallyacosf! But this whole reading experience just made me really want to reread tog asap! especially because (i can’t believe i am typing this) i think nesta is really making it hard for me to say that manon is my favorite sjm character!blog|instagram|youtube|kofi|spotify|amazon1.)Throne of Glass★★1.)A Court of Thorns and Roses★★★★2.)A Court of Mist and Fury★★★3.)A Court of Wings and Ruin★★★3.1)A Court of Frost and Starlight★★★4)A \u200bCourt of Silver Flames★★★★""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'SJM??????Byrce ruined this whole book for me..I feel like SJM just wanted to throw in everything in one book and hoped for the best.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I FINISHED….IT’S DONE.I will never recover from this series.

Having said that, there were some things that did bother me in this book. Some parts were underwhelming, which really pains me to say.Overall though, CC will always hold such a special place in my heart. SJM said this was the “conclusion” to Bryce & Hunt’s story, and that honestly makes me so sad. I’m sure it is for some other prominent characters too.It will be a while, but there is a 4th CC book coming, SJM confirmed this. I honestly can’t wait to see who it’s about.

Despite my mixed feelings, I was completely engrossed the whole time and enjoyed it. It genuinely makes it hard to rate the book 🫠 I’m leaning towards 3.5 stars. It's not to say it was a bad book; it’s just not what I thought it’d be, and it gave acompletely differentvibe to CC1&2.Spoilers ahead!!-----The book is extremely plot driven, and I loved learning about the universe’s lore! I don’t think I’ll ever wrap my head around everything revealed. How Sarah can think up these ideas and craft such intricate worlds, I have no idea!🤯Part 1 was intense!The crossover was amazing. I appreciated how the book remained a Crescent City book and wasn’t wholly overpowered by the crossover. However, I didn’t like that too much was revealed all at once, too quickly, and mainly through direct dialogue. It would have been better if Bryce had discovered things on her own instead of being told straight up. It was almost a little too convenient. It set the tone for the rest of the discoveries as well. Nothing was played out entirely to its full potential.The lore was amazing, there’s no denying that, but the execution of it could have been better. It felt flat and almost like a tick box exercise, unlike Sarah’s usual style. With the number of things that were revealed, it might have been better to split this into two books as it sometimes felt rushed. I can’t get over the fact that this entire book's timeline wasONE WEEK!If it could have been spread further, it would have worked so much better, and that way, it would have addressed the lack of depth.My main dislike of the book was the completelack of emotional connection. All the characters lost the usual flair they had in CC1&2. It was as if they all lost their personalities. And maybe that’s with it being plot driven, but something just felt off with them all, and there was a sort of emptiness to them. It’s the complete opposite of CC1&2. Those books had me sobbing, but with this one, I didn’t find it anywhere near as emotional as I thought it would be or what it attempted to be. My issues with this started to present during part 2, with the reunion of all the characters.It was so underwhelming.We know Sarah likes her POV switch ups, and I usually don’t mind it in any of her books, but something was off here. The switches were abrupt and often within the same chapter, so any emotional development happening instantly fell short, and I struggled to immerse myself. Not to be picky, but there were many grammatical errors, too. I found many missing quotation marks, which just ended up disrupting the flow even further, as I was like'wait, when did the dialogue start?'On the other hand, I didn’t find myself getting bored in anyone’s storyline since it was extremely fast paced. It was hard to find a good point to put it down as the plot and the story just never stopped!Bryce frustrated me so much!She almost felt like a completely different character, and her character arc was extremely messy and frankly made no sense. She was acting as if she knew everything and was so unserious. Thankfully, part 3 is where she starts to return to her usual self, and by the end of the book, I was thinking'there’s the Bryce I know and love'. But the arc she went on to get to that point was bizarre.Bryce and Hunt’s relationship is part of what made me love CC so much, but their relationship in this book was flat. It lacked the chemistry, banter, and warmth they usually had. Sarah, why on earth did you have them arguing after their reunion!?!?!? Why were they constantly at odds with each other? I thought they had resolved their trust issues in CC2, so I did not like the angst between them at all. I get that they’re portrayed as a real couple, but I’m sad at how it played out 😭 They just needed to talk to each other and explain their feelings, but it was instantly shut down whenever they tried. That was primarily due to Bryce - I don’t understand why she acted as she did towards Hunt; she constantly dismissed his feelings. And again, the abrupt POV changes did not help. I’m glad they returned to normal in part 3, and I’m happy I got the bonus chapters between them to end it on a good note.Ruhn and Lidia were certainly a highlight!! There were loads of reveals about Lidia, which were completely unexpected. It made me love her even more. I must admit their relationship development felt awkwardly paced to me, though, which is such a shame because their romance journey could have been so much more beautiful 😭Surprisingly, I enjoyed Tharion’s and Ithan’s chapters. They added a nice reprieve from the intensity and added some value to the journey towards the end.Part 3 saved the book for meand was the only part where I felt somewhat emotional, even though the ending was pretty convenient. At no point did I even fear for any character, as it just didn’t feel high stakes enough. Shahar’s appearance was such a lovely surprise. I loved the reveal of Brann’s name. I didn’t connect the dots with that one, so I jumped out of my skin at that!! The sprites were some of my favourite side characters, and the mentions of Lele were a nice touch too 🥺 The Hel plot was handled well, and the reveal of Hunt’s father was a great twist.Overall,I’m feeling pretty bittersweet about it.Part 1 was good, I didn’t entirely like part 2, and part 3 saved it. It set up the next ACOTAR book well, and I can see how the next CC book will play out too.———————————————HAPPY HOFAS RELEASE DAY 🥳———————————————apparently the book has beenleakedand people are postingspoilersof the ending on twitter/tiktok etc😭 thankfully I haven’t seen anything but just had to give you guys a warning to be careful!!!———————————————OMG we have a cover!!!Jan 2024 can’t come quick enough 😫""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Super Magical Starborn waste of my goddamn time.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'oh wow no one died again.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Go girl, give us nothing!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '""The Hind knelt before her undying masters and contemplated how it would feel to tear out their throats.""❤️\u200d🔥-Line 1, Page 1.Spoiler Free Review.SJM has somehow managed to completely capture my heart and blow my mind once again!I want to start by saying that SJM never fails to completely capture my heart.

Do my best to collect myself and then just jump right back in.It is so addictive and fast paced!It was consuming, exciting, riveting, an edge of your seat, nail biting thrill ride!!In the first two books there were times I would get a little lost with the plot because, let\'s be honest- there\'sA LOTgoing on but withHOFASI felt that the story was very clear and concise. No murky or confusing plot points. No need to get out your legal pad to take notes. Lol. 😉The pacing was fast for a good amount of the time but slowed when necessary letting you breathe for a moment to take in all that is going on. The romance is absolutely chef\'s kiss 💋The magic is ohhh so magical.And that crossover - lawd. I need some of ya\'ll to get at me because...All in all SJM delivered, she put in the work on this one.I would say it\'s arguably her best book to date!Okay, maybe not that far.. but still one of the best.I\'m not going to post any quotes or passages at this time as the majority will be spoilers - will update this review at a later time for that. 💗'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""if this doesn't have a scene where ruhn danaan declares his undying love for me i don't want it""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'i literally, don’t even want to talk about it.'}]"

The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo
",Taylor Jenkins Reid,4.41,3431571,2981,"Fiction, Historical Fiction, LGBT, Contemporary, Audiobook, Queer, Historical",389,13-06-2017,"Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband has left her, and her professional life is going nowhere. Regardless of why Evelyn has selected her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s luxurious apartment, Monique listens in fascination as the actress tells her story. From making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the ‘80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way, Evelyn unspools a tale of ruthless ambition, unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love. Monique begins to feel a very real connection to the legendary star, but as Evelyn’s story nears its conclusion, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': '5/5 Stars ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️ ⭐️“People think that intimacy is about sex.

This book is spectacular. This book is outstanding. I have nothing negative to say about this book. It\'s a pure 5 star for me. I\'m irrevocably astonished and astounded.

AFTER THIS LINE I HAD TO FINISH THIS BOOK.And I decided I would finish it. I would read more than 150 pages and finish it. So I went to my obligation the next day with 4 hours of sleep but I was happy about it. Because I knew I couldn\'t survive a whole day without finishing this book. I would die. This is the impact this book has had on me. Now, let\'s talk specifics.Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one in the journalism community is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?Monique is not exactly on top of the world. Her husband, David, has left her, and her career has stagnated. Regardless of why Evelyn has chosen her to write her biography, Monique is determined to use this opportunity to jumpstart her career.Summoned to Evelyn’s Upper East Side apartment, Monique listens as Evelyn unfurls her story: from making her way to Los Angeles in the 1950s to her decision to leave show business in the late 80s, and, of course, the seven husbands along the way. As Evelyn’s life unfolds through the decades—revealing a ruthless ambition, an unexpected friendship, and a great forbidden love—Monique begins to feel a very a real connection to the actress. But as Evelyn’s story catches up with the present, it becomes clear that her life intersects with Monique’s own in tragic and irreversible ways.Historical fiction is my favorite genre of all time. I love it in every form, books, tv shows, movies. But not this kind of historical fiction, theOutlanderandRoss Poldarkkind of historical fiction. The older one, you could say. Also, historical fiction about wars and stuff, which is more recent. But I have never read something about the Old Hollywood. I have only watched movies and tv shows about it. So this was new territory for me.I will admit, it took me about 150 pages to get fully immersed into the story. Up until that point, the book was a 4 star for me. Which is still amazing, but I didn\'t quite understand the hype till that point. A little after Evelyn divulges her secret love, and basically everything starts, my wig is totally snatched. I\'m into the book 100%, ready to knowEVERYTHINGaboutEVERYTHING. The pace was so incredibly fast, there was not a moment I felt my eyes close. The writing was impeccable, some narrations of scenes kept my heart racing. There weren\'t any redundant descriptions of places or rooms, there were descriptions of faces and clothes which kept me enthralled into to the story. The author did an amazing research, it was obvious that she knew her shit, everything was on point. The story kept me on my toes each time with its smart maneuvers, the schemes, the plans, everything the main characters did, all the choices they made, to dodge unfortunate situations. Everything was just... on point. I have nothing bad to say. This never happens. This book was just too perfect. I want to cry because, if not for the hype, I wouldn\'t have picked up this book. And I would have lost such an amazing journey, such an important book. Thank you all for loving this book and making me love it too.Evelyn. Evelyn Hugo is the most flawlessly written character I have ever witnessed. No, wrong. She isn\'t a character to me. She is a person. With influences fromMerilyn MonroeandElizabeth Taylor, the author made Evelyn Hugo her own star. Every time I would read about a scene from one of the movies, I was like ""Oh, I will watch that movie next."", and then I remembered that she doesn\'t actually exist. Which made me sad, because all of the content of this book was so interesting. I felt like I was reading an actual autobiography from a real legendary actress. It was incredible. Evelyn is such a good written character, a good written character, not a good person. She is raw, devious, manipulative, scheming, cold-hearted. She is basically a bitch. But you can\'t help but to want to know everything about her. You want to slap the shit out of her one moment and then hug her the next. She is sensual, enticing, seductive. She always knows what to say to make you believe in her cause. She uses her greatest assets to her benefit, and she isn\'t ashamed about it. She doesn\'t give a fuck. She wants to climb the ladder and she will do anything to achieve her goal. Even marry seven men who will serve her purpose. And she does it. With her scandalous life and her improved acting skills and beneficial movie choices, she climbs to the top. But we also see her sensitive side, her human side. We see her deep friendship with Harry, another remarkable character. We see her love for her child. We see her devotion to Celia. We see her as a human too, with real emotions. And I find that marvelous. I wish all characters in books had so much depth, so much meaning. And not the John Green kind of pretentious deep meaning. The real one.Monique. An underdeveloped character, in my opinion. I didn\'t care that much about her, but her story was gripping. To be honest, Evelyn didn\'t let me care a lot about any other character. She took my attention all to herself. Which is what she did with the entire world. But anyway. An unknown journalist requested to write one of the most popular actresses\' biography. A 35 year old woman, who feels like she hasn\'t achieved much so far in her life. She has a ruined marriage, an under prestigious job, she has been under appreciated all her life, even though she possesses many skills. She is also a POC, and she is mislabeled literally every day. I needed more of her character, I needed to see more of her. But after Evelyn\'s story started, we didn\'t get much of her. But I\'m so happy that she stood up to herself and her self love grew. That Evelyn showed her the way, and she got out of a meaningless marriage, she made deals regarding her job, her future, she stood on her own two feet. I\'m really proud of her.THE REPRESENTATION. THIS BOOK HAD THE BEST REPRESENTATION I HAVE EVER SEEN. Suck it all of you who keep saying a historian fiction can\'t entail good representation.IN YOUR FACES. We have two main interracial characters. One bisexual character, one lesbian character and one gay character. And these are just the main character. We also got side representation, from not as important characters in the story. This factor upped the story so much to me. We got to see the struggles that POV and gay people used to face in a time like this. We got to see our main character hide her true lineage to rise at the top of Hollywood. We got to see two lovers hiding their true sexuality, hiding their undying love for each other because the world would never understand. The conversations between the characters about homophobia of that time period were heartbreaking. I saw so much of our own time in them. So many things have changed since then in our world, and so many have not. We can see the comparisons from these types of books. And it\'s a reminder of how our society is moving forward of backwards. The representation made this book what it is. If every single character was white and straight, I wouldn\'t have been as awed by this book as I am now. And I am myself, a while straight female. Imagine how important representation is for people who can actually relate to it. I would never understand.This book had so many layers. Everything was thought of and processed. Nothing was sloppy, nothing was lacking meaning. Every single word had its reason to be written. I feel privileged to have had the honor of reading this book. It will stick to me for a very long time. I also enjoyed the little snippets we got from the newspapers. They made the setting all the much more real. The relationships were everything, the friendships, the love stories. Evelyn\'s life is so engaging and complicated, you can\'t get enough of it. We truly see how corrupt the Old Hollywood was. And it makes us think about the New Hollywood. Is it still like this? Is everything we see just a fabricated lie? All the lies the characters came up with, seemed to work. I guess, we can never know what happens between closed doors. But I think the New Hollywood is more sincere. It\'s more about talent, at the most part. I\'d like to hope so.In conclusion, I could rave about this book for days. I have so much to say, I could write a book myself. But I\'m gonna end it here. This book was a present sent to me by God himself. I want to read it again and again and again and absorb its wisdom. This book would be such an amazing source material for a movie adaptation.WE NEED THIS TO HAPPEN. But I\'m scared they would ruin it. I\'m always scared with book to movie adaptations. We all readers are. Anyway, I couldn\'t recommend this enough. It doesn\'t matter if you don\'t read historical fiction or adult,PICK THIS BOOK UP. You won\'t regret it one bit. So, till the next one... K BYE!!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '”Evelyn always leaves you hoping you’ll get just a little bit more. And she always denies you.”This book was so, so, soGOOD!!I swear I was barely two pages in and already knew that I’d love it with all my heart! <3 There’s just something about that golden Hollywood era that captivated me right from the beginning and once Evelyn entered the scene I was a goner. I just loved the way her story was told!We didn’t only get the interviews with Monique but also were able to read news articles about her life and this made everything so much more intriguing. I mean “Hollywood Digest”, “Sub Rosa” or the “New York Tribune”, they all wrote about Evelyn’s life and those articles give an authenticity that makes this book feel real. It could have happened, Evelyn could have been a real Hollywood Star and people could have been as fascinated by her as by Marilyn Monroe or Marlene Dietrich.I think to some degree Taylor Jenkins Reid might have even had Marilyn Monroe in her mind when she wrote Evelyn’s character and knowing how awesome Marilyn was this really doesn’t come as a surprise. XD Another thing I appreciated was that every husband got a part of this book and even though there were seven of them, who all influenced Evelyn and left a mark on her character, none of them actually was her one true love. It’s a very particular approach to a great story and I loved the way it was carried out.Still, after I read the ending my mind was reeling and my feelings were so mixed that I had a tough time coming to terms with everything that was revealed. There were so many things I felt conflicted about and even now, after more than a week has passed, I still didn’t manage to sort out my feelings and I still don’t know what to do with them. Maybe I’ll have to get used to the idea that to think about Evelyn Hugo and her seven husbands will always make me feel conflicted and that there’s no such thing as making peace with an ending like that.And maybe, just maybe, that was Taylor Jenkins Reid’s plan all along. ;-)The characters:Welcome to my characters section, aka “The spoilery spoiler zone”! If you didn’t read the book yet and still want to be surprised by its revelations you better don’t continue to read my review. I’m worse than any tabloid mentioned in this book and I’ll spoil you relentlessly! If you still want to read my gossip, go ahead, but don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;-PEvelyn Hugo:”And I didn’t say I was confessing any sins. To say that what I have to tell is a sin is misleading and hurtful. I don’t feel regret for the things I’ve done – at least, not the things you might expect – despite how hard they may have been or how repugnant they may seem in the cold light of day.”Oh, Evelyn! Where do I even begin? I loved that woman so damn much, I can’t even! <333 It’s so rare to meet such a complex character in a book but damn Evelyn just had it all! She was neither white nor black, and if anything she was all different shades of grey. I loved that she was so ruthless, that she did what she had to do in order to get what she wanted, that she was unapologetic about her decisions and behaviour and that she never held back and just wanted it all! Celia was right, at times Evelyn could be really awful and egoistic, but damn did her good qualities make up for it. Compassionate, caring and protective of the ones she loved she would have done everything possible to keep them safe and happy. Gosh,WHAT. A. WOMAN!I think I might be in love with her! <333”Did I want to make as much money as Don? Of course I did. I wanted to get the paycheck and mail a copy of it to him with a photo of my middle finger. But mostly I wanted the freedom to do whatever I wanted.””I told her every single day that her life had been the world’s greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.””I regret every second I didn’t spend with her. I regret every stupid thing I did that caused her an ounce of pain. I should have chased her down the street the day she left me. I should have begged her to stay. I should have apologized and sent roses and stood on top of the Hollywood sign and shouted, ‘I’m in love with Celia St. James!’ and let them crucify me for it.”Celia St. James:”I really like you. I like watching you on-screen. I like how the moment you show up in a scene, I can’t look at anything else. I like the way your skin is too dark for your blond hair, the way the two shouldn’t go together and yet seem so natural on you. And to be honest, I like how calculating and awful you kind of are.”Now here’s the thing, I know that Celia was the love of Evelyn’s life and I could see that they loved each other deeply, but – and here comes the hugeBUT– I had the feeling that I could never truly connect to her. I don’t know what it was that kept me from adoring her the way I adore Evelyn but I think it might have been the sum of thousands of little things that ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth. For instance I hated that Evelyn always seemed to feel like she had done something wrong and that it was her responsibility to set things right again. I mean Celia threw a lot of awful things at her too, but in the end it always seemed to be Evelyn that blamed herself for it. Also I didn’t like that Celia wasn’t only self-righteous but also more than just a little judgemental. You’d think a person who represents the “L” in LGBTQ+ would be more accepting and open-minded when her partner is bi, but nope Celia was almost as bi-phobic as the men in Evelyn’s life and that made me really sad. =(”That was how it was with Celia. When you denied her what she wanted, when you hurt her, she made sure you hurt, too.””So I told myself that the spark between Celia and me was just a quirk we had. Which was convincing as long as it remained quirky.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.”Harry Cameron:”I want to be with someone I love. I want to have a companion. I’d like to bring someone home to my family. I don’t want to live alone anymore. And I want a son or a daughter. We could have that together. I can’t give you everything. I know that. But I want to raise a family, and I’d love to raise one with you.”Aside from Evelyn, Harry Cameron wastruly the best thingabout this entire book! <33 I loved this man so much and I think he’s an angel! He was always respectful and supportive and even more important he accepted Evelyn exactly the way she was. I loved that he and Evelyn always tried to solve every problem together and I hated to see him so sad after the death of John. T_T Harry’s grief broke my heart and even though he was drinking way too much he never did anything stupid. I mean he never hurt Evelyn or got frustrated with her, he only tried to compensate his grief without hurting anyone else in the process. Even when it came to this he was considerate and kind. =(( Poor Harry, though. It made me so damn sad that he had to go and I admit it, I actually shed some tears when he died. T_TMonique Grant:”Why, until this moment, did I not realize that the issue is my own confidence? That the root of most of my problems is that I need to be secure enough in who I am to tell anyone who doesn’t like it to go fuck themselves? Why have I spent so long settling for less when I know damn well the world expects more?”To say their relationship was complicated would be putting it more than just mildly! It was really interesting to see Monique’s character arc though. I mean at the beginning she was a shy mouse that didn’t dare to say anything to her boss and by the end of the book she was a young successful woman who stood up for herself and finally had the guts to make decisions she never even dared to consider. I think that to get to know Evelyn and to find out the truth behind her father’s death was necessary to find her happiness and I’m convinced that both of those things were able to give her some closure. I could understand her anger towards Evelyn, her hurt when she found out what she had done and the inability to truly hate her for it. Because she got to know the person behind the movie star and she knew how broken Evelyn was on the inside, how much pain she had suffered, how much loss she had endured. =( Still, that scene when she pondered whether to get on the train or not, the thoughts that crossed her mind, her inner struggle how to deal with the situation at hand. Damn, this was one of the best book moments I ever had the pleasure to read. Well done, Taylor Jenkins Reid, well done! I had goose bumps following that inner conflict. *shudders*”I’m Evelyn.” She reaches out and takes my hand, shaking it. It strikes me as a unique form of power to say your own name when you know that everyone in the room, everyone in the world, already knows it.””I insist that you be ruthless in your negotiating, Monique. Make them pay you what they would pay a white man. And then, once you’ve done that, every penny from it will be yours.”The relationships & ships:Evelyn & Celia:”I wanted to give her a lot of things. I wanted what I had to be hers. I wondered if this was what it felt like to love someone.”Those two were the death of me, I swear! Their ups and downs, their struggles and fights, their love and dreams, their hopes and shattered realities. ARGH! It was so obvious they loved each other, yet they could never be together. Because the world didn’t let them and wouldn’t have understood, because they didn’t want the same thing, because they weren’t ready to be in a relationship and unable to make arrangements. Because… justBECAUSE!There was always another reason why they couldn’t be happy, another misunderstanding that tore at their foundations, another bump on the road that caused them to drift apart. They loved and lost and loved and lost again. It was so heart-breaking to watch! And Celia, she killed me. With everything she said to Evelyn! I knew she loved her, yet she hurt her so much! >_< I just wished she would have had more sympathy for Evelyn’s outlook and I really wish she would have tried to understand Evelyn’s sexuality. So many of their problems could have been solved, they could have gained so many years if they just would have allowed themselves to be who they are. Their love was so tragic… more tragic than any of the movies they produced over the years. And it really made me sad. T_T”Evelyn, who was your great love? You can tell me.”Evelyn looks out the window, breathes in deeply, and then says, “Celia St. James.”The room is quiet as Evelyn lets herself hear her own words. And then she smiles, a bright, wide, deeply sincere smile. She starts laughing to herself and then refocuses on me. “I feel like I spent my entire life loving her.””It’s not wrong,” Celia said. “It shouldn’t be wrong, to love you. How can it be wrong?”“It’s not wrong, sweetheart. It’s not,” I said. “They’re wrong.””If you love someone enough, you should be able to overcome anything,” she said. “And we have always loved each other so much, more than I ever thought I could be loved, more than I ever thought I could love. So why … why couldn’t we overcome it?”“We did,” I said, turning towards her. “We’re here.”She shook her head. “But the years,” she said.”There’s a difference between sexuality and sex. I used sex to get what I wanted. Sex is just an act. Sexuality is a sincere expression of desire and pleasure. That I always kept for Celia.”Evelyn & Harry:”You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until someone stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”So I fell down.And Harry caught me.Their friendship was everything, absolutelyE.V.E.R.Y.T.H.I.N.G.!!!Gosh, I loved their relationship so much, I can’t even!!! They were so perfect together and understood each other better than anyone else. They were so close it sometimes felt like they could read each other’s mind and I think of all the husbands Evelyn married over the years, Harry definitely was the best! <333 (Of course her last hubby was awesome too but if you ask me no one was able to hold a candle to Harry!) I know Harry was gay and had no sexual desire for women and I know that Evelyn loved Celia but damn those two made so much sense! They shared a love that is sometimes even harder to find than the once in a lifetime love we all crave for and they were so much more than just friends. They were business partners, equals, best friends, partners in crime, confidants, soul mates and kindred spirits. And most importantly, they loved each other deeply! <333 It’s so rare to find a friend like that, so rare to have a connection like that, to be loved liked that… ARGH! I justLOVEDthem!!! This was such a wholesome representation of a deep friendship and I’m incapable to put it into words. *breaks down and sobs*”I promise I’ll do whatever I can. I promise you we will figure this out.”“OK,” Harry said, and then he squeezed my hand back and walked out the door. “We will figure this out.””I want you to stay, Harry. We need you. Me and Connor.” I grabbed his hand tighter. “But if you have to go, then go. Go if it hurts. Go if it’s time. Just go knowing you were loved, that I will never forget you, that you will live in everything Connor and I do. Go knowing I love you purely, Harry, that you were an amazing father. Go knowing I told you all my secrets. Because you were my best friend.”The bi rep:”It really makes you think, doesn’t it? That people were so eager to believe we were swapping spouses but would have been scandalized to know we were monogamous and queer?”And now we finally come to one of the most important subjects of this book: The bi rep! And let me tell you, it was spot-on! Evelyn is a bi icon and for the rest of my life I’ll never get tired of emphasizing how important this kind of representation is! Throughout the entire book Evelyn is confronted with bi-phobia but she always took it in stride! She accepted herself the way she was and she did an amazing job at trying to explain her sexuality. I know some of you might say that it shouldn’t even be necessary to explain your sexuality to others and I’m inclined to agree, but the bitter truth is that we have to explain it no matter if we want to or not. I can only speak from personal experience here but usually straight people have a hard time understanding how you can love both sexes equally and make no difference, while lesbian or gay people might just try to label you as one of their own. What Celia did?! It happens! It happens way too often and even though her actions and behaviour left a bitter taste in my mouth it still represented one of the many facets of reality. I loved the way Taylor Jenkins Reid gave Evelyn a voice though. Evelyn Hugo didn’t accept those prejudices, nope, she gave us her honest opinion, her point of view and made the other characters acknowledge her for who she was! And this was wholesome and healthy and might help a lot of people to accept themselves! So thank you Taylor Jenkins Reid! Thank you very much! <333”Being bisexual didn’t make me disloyal,” Evelyn says. “One has nothing to do with the other. Nor did it mean that Celia could only fulfil half my needs.””I hated being called a lesbian. Not because I thought there was anything wrong with loving a woman, mind you. No, I’d come to terms with that a long time ago. But Celia only saw things in black and white. She liked women and only women. And I liked her. And so she often denied the rest of me.””Wow,” he said. “Incredible. I married a dyke.”“Stop saying that,” I said.“Evelyn, if you have sex with women, you are a lesbian. Don’t be a self-hating lesbian. That’s not… that’s not becoming.”My conclusion:The more I think about this book, the more I love it! This is such an important read! I know Reid tackled a lot of problematic topics in this book, but she did it in such a positive and sensible way that I’m convinced everyone who reads“The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo”will learn something good from it! I’m usually not the kind of person who throws a book at you and says you should read it but in all seriousness: Read this one! Live and suffer with Evelyn, enjoy her good moments and cry with her when the world throws her for a loop! Hate her, love her, accept her the way she is. And most importantly, learn from her mistakes and don’t hesitate to show the world your true self. ;-)I know this review has been already way too long but I still want to thank the ever charmingAshleyfor this wonderful buddy read! We both didn’t have it easy while reading this book together, but we always managed to find a compromise and were able to continue once our lives started to become a little less hectic. *lol* I’m glad we could read this together and I hope sooner or later we’ll find another book to buddy read again! =)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '➸4.5 stars➷ the seven husbands of evelyn hugo by taylor jenkins reid is a captivating novel that delves into the glamorous and tumultuous life of the enigmatic hollywood icon, evelyn hugo. the story is narrated by monique grant, a young journalist who is given the exclusive opportunity to interview evelyn hugo, now in her late seventies, about her legendary career and her seven marriages and tumultuous relationships that shaped her career and personal life. as monique delves deeper into evelyn’s story, she uncovers shocking revelations that force her to confront her own past and identity.— this book honestly surpassed my expectations. i’m always a bit iffy about reading popular books, but i absolutely loved this story! i honestly did not expect it to make me cry so much, seriously this book had no right ripping my heart out into tiny little pieces. i don’t even think this was supposed to be an emotional read but my heart just broke for these characters and how they weren’t allowed to love whoever they wanted. i grew so attached to these characters and parting ways with them was such a tragedy to me lmaoo. evelyn, celia, harry and john are truly my little family. i should’ve closed the book after the picnic scene and just pretended that they all lived happily ever after 😭💔tjr’s writing style is just mesmerising. she has this incredible ability for drawing you into her stories with such vivid detail that you feel like you’re right there in the moment, experiencing everything alongside her characters. this story transports us back into old hollywood and it makes me feel like i’m immersed into the glitz and glamour of the ‘50s and ‘60s silver screen.psa: mick riva needs his own tw. i’m so tired of having to see that deadbeat’s name!! he is a jump scare at this point.➳evelyn hugo:“i’m bisexual, don’t ignore half of me so you can fit me into a box.”she’s an icon, she’s a legend and she is the moment. she’s so effortlessly glamorous, she’s brilliant and powerful but that doesn’t mean she is a good person — but she’s not an unlikeable character. i understand all the decisions and sacrifices she had to make to get to where she is in life. she done some horrible things, but she would NEVER take them back because she only wanted to protect the people she loved the most. she is a flawed character, she’s ruthless, selfish, manipulative and she is unapologetic about her life choices and wasn’t afraid to use her body to get important roles. evelyn always has to get her own way but that made me love her even more and what gave her so much depth. she lived her life the best way she could. she had a dream she was determined to fulfil and she knew what she had to do to make her dream a reality.➳celia st. james:“all i’ve ever wanted was for you to be truly mine. but you’ve never been mine. not really. i’ve always had to settle for one piece of you. while the world gets the other half. i don’t blame you. it doesn’t make me stop loving you. but i can’t do it. i can’t do it, evelyn.”SCREAMING, CRYING, THROWING UP!! I WILL KEEP SAYING IT, THEY DESERVED MORE TIME TOGETHER!! TJR YOU ARE A SICK WOMAN, YOU WILL BE HEARING FROM MY THERAPIST 😭😭oh celia, the love of evelyn’s life. she’s another complicated character but i actually loved her, she’s the complete opposite to evelyn. she embodies kindness and compassion in her own right. while evelyn was portrayed as confident and assertive, celia’s demeanour was more reserved and gentle. she could be mean-spirited towards evelyn, i get she always done it out of hurt and jealousy but she had to understand that evelyn went to great lengths to protect their relationship from ever being exposed. but celia loved and cared for evelyn so deeply. tjr perfectly captured celia’s selfishness and her closeted struggles, as well as her complicated feelings with having to share evelyn with others. i would do ANYTHING for celia’s pov especially during the time when they didn’t talk for 5 years 😖➳harry cameron:“it’s ok, you can fall down now. i’ll catch you.” so i fell down. and harry caught me.the friendship between evelyn and harry is truly so special. they are the epitome of ‘platonic soulmates.’ he was present for the majority of evelyn’s life. their friendship is built on a foundation of mutual respect and understanding. they will always have each others back no matter the circumstances. my heart broke with him when he lost john because he ended up losing himself that day too. i loved his relationship with his daughter, she was truly the light of his life and what kept him going. he deserved the world and he deserved so much better. we all deserve a harry cameron in our life <33➳monique grant:as evelyn’s chosen confidante, monique finds herself drawn into a world of glamour and intrigue far removed from her own humble existence. tasked with penning evelyn’s long-awaited memoir, monique is granted unparalleled access to the inner workings of evelyn’s mind and heart, a privilege that comes with its own set of challenges and responsibilities. but i’m going to be straight up and say that her character honestly has no importance to me whatsoever. as a secondary character she was overshadowed by evelyn’s life and her character lacked so much depth. the reveal of the significant plot connection to evelyn later on left me feeling underwhelmed due to the lack of emphasis on monique and her story throughout the book.꒰evelyn + celia:꒱“i spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much i loved her.”i am a evelyncelia defender for life!! if they have no fans, i am dead. their love story is absolutely heartbreaking. their connection is electric, their moments together is filled with so much raw emotion and undeniable chemistry. yet as the story unfolds, it becomes clear that they are star-crossed lovers, bound by societal expectations and personal sacrifices. yes it seemed complex but at times their relationship was toxic. the ache for more time together is palpable — i’m so mad bc i wish they had so much more time together, to bask in their love without the constraints of society or circumstance. they were robbed of many precious moments and they lost so many years. every stolen moment between them is filled with longing and passion, it constantly had me yearning for more. yet amidst all the heartache, their love for one another shines so brightly. they are truly the epitome of soulmates. their relationship was so heart wrenching because they truly deserved so much better. they deserved to love each other freely and unabashedly!! ❤️\u200d🩹— overall, this book is a masterful tapestry of love, ambition, and the search for identity set against the dazzling backdrop of old hollywood. tjr’s exquisite prose and nuanced characters invite readers on an unforgettable journey, challenging them to reflect on the true cost of fame and the enduring power of authenticity. with its gripping narrative and rich historical detail, this novel transcends its genre, leaving a lasting impression on all who have the pleasure of delving into evelyn hugo’s captivating world. this story made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me angry but i adored this book and these character with my whole heart. i can’t wait for the netflix adaption, my heart is going to be broken all over again and i’m so ready for it lmaoo.───♡─────────────why did this book have me crying like a lil bitch 😭 i am evelyn hugo’s #1 defender until the day i die!! rtc—this slump is eating me alive!!! also the fact i still haven’t read this book is criminal. in tjr we trust 😩'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This review contains a spoiler for a reveal around 100 pages into the novel. I knew this reveal going in and do not believe knowing this reveal hurts the reading experience.I think a lot about the idea of love as something dangerous, as something that you have to fight for. And it's only recently that I've decided that's something that probably has to do with loving women. I have been very lucky, in growing up in liberal California and in the 2000s. But I received marriage rights in my country four months after realizing I liked girls, and in reading about the past and thinking about the past, I am constantly, daily, reminded how being born ten years earlier would have made everything that much more dangerous, that much more violent, that much more fearful.And there is something so woefully romantic to me about the fact that there were people who braved that climate and loved anyway and paved the path, while doing so, for me and so many others.So that's all to say that this book made me experience all five stages of grief and simultaneously made me feel every positive emotion in the world and I have no idea how that is possible. but listen, if you only read one book I recommend you this year, I want it to be this one.“Make them pay you as much as they would a white man.”The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois, yeah, about the seven husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Seven husbands who are sometimes awful and sometimes sympathetic and sometimes somewhere in between. Ernie, who she used to get to where she is, Don, who beat her till she barely knew whether to continue, Harry, who she loved more than any of them, Max, who loves the idea of her more than he could ever love her.But I think, despite its marketing, this book is really about Evelyn.Awful, complicated, completely lovable Evelyn. Evelyn is a flawed, compelling, brave, ambitious woman who got to where she was with teeth and claws and never gave up. She is also, and I’m not even joking, one of the most iconic characters I have ever had the pleasure of reading about. She is a woman with a lot of ambition but also one who loves and wants to be loved. She issucha good character.This book is also fiercely and unapologetically socio-political and Ilovethat. Evelyn’s story is one of being a woman in a man’s world. It is one of being a Cuban woman in a white woman’s world. It is one of being a bisexual woman in an era where attraction to women was demonized by the whole culture. It is one of hiding yourself for ambition, one of trying to decide which one takes precedent, one of aging, and one of never knowing whether your choices wereright.Annnnnnnd this book also has the most fucking heartbreaking romantic relationship I have had the displeasure to read about in my entire life. I don’t… I don’t know if romantic relationships should be considered spoilers, but… well, I knew going in who the actual love of Evelyn’s life was and it STILL WORKED FOR ME. So here it is: Evelyn Hugo and Celia St. James are one of my favorite fictional relationships, of all time, ever. These two have a complicated, flawed, at times tumultous relationship, and yet they love each other so much, always.“People think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.”And perhaps my favorite part was the messaging around the importance of actual love in relationships, rather than just a willingness to try.“You didn't come here and tell me how much you miss me. Or how hard it has been to live without me. You said you didn't want to give up. And I don't want to give up, either. I don't want to fail at this. But that's not actually a great reason to stay together. We should have reasonswhywe don't want to give. It shouldn't just bethatwe don't want to give up. And I don't... have any.“You have never felt like my other half.”I know I’ve talked about a lot of specific things in the book, but I don’t know exactly how to put into words what this bookmeantto me. You can almost feel how much Taylor Jenkins Reidfeltthis book.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoleft me an emotional mess, but also ahappymess. All I know is I feel ruined for any other book, and I want you to be as well.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""CLICK HERE for a Booktube Videoabout:Ten Fabulous Book Reviews and One That Will Make You Go -doesn't that belong to Miranda Reads?Now that you know this one made the list check the video review to see the rest (and find the stolen surprise)!The Written Review3.75 starsHeartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.Evelyn Hugo was the star of the century.She dominated the big screen for more than four decades. Every man wanted her and every woman wanted to be her.Perhaps most famously, Evelyn Hugo wasmarried seven times.Each divorce only increased her fame.Rumors swept through the tabloids like wildfire.I’m under absolutely no obligation to make sense to you.And now, age 79, Evelyn Hugo decided to auction off her mostwildly famous gownsand offered one lucky journalist (Monique) an interview that will last a lifetime.However, Monique soon learns that this is beyond a two-page spread. Evelyn Hugo is offering a tell-all - a full biography - that promises to be the mostscandalous and salaciousthing that has ever graced this world.Monique would be a fool - an absolute fool - to pass this up. But the thought, the 'it's too good to be true' sort of thought, continues to replay in her mind.Sometimes reality comes crashing down on you. Other times reality simply waits, patiently, for you to run out of the energy it takes to deny it.Overall, this one was good but I was never wowed.Everyone and their mother was talking up this book and while I agree that it is engaging and scandalous (in a good way)...I don't know.I just expected more from it.I definitely think it was well-written...just a bit dull in areas.We start the book with 40 pages of just talking up Evelyn Hugo and it really did drag. There's only so many times I can hear about howwonderful and stunninga person is before it gets boring.I think if more of the marriages were teased in the beginning - just to give the audience a taste of the mystery surrounding her love life (rather than going on and on about how intriguing it was...without telling us what was intriguing about it) would have helped significantly.Once we got to her life, the book certainly picked up.I really lovedhow Evelyn's sexuality was portrayedin this book. I liked watching her grow as a person - from a teenager using sex to get herself out of a hellhole to falling in love and finding it something to be cherished.Her love forCeliathroughout the years truly made thiswildly unbelievable story cinchfor me. Honestly,her relationship with CeliaTheir love was expertly done, with all of the fear and paranoia associated with the times, that it truly felt like real life.Ultimately, this was an enjoyable read, a bit slow paced, but enjoyable nonetheless!Never let anyone make you feel ordinary.YouTube|Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Facebook| Snapchat @miranda_reads""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""WOW I NEVER POSTED THIS. What a pleasant surprise! After dozens of unposted-unwritten reviews, finally an unposted-but-written one. Life is beautiful.But first off (I can call this first off if I freaking want to!!!) I wanna say: DON’T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT HISTORICAL FICTION CAN’T BE DIVERSE. Tell that anthropomorphized tennis ball they’re either uncreative or a secret bigot or a full-on dunce or ALL THREE. Because this book pulls it off with more than a tablespoon of grace, I’ll tell you that.My guy, there aren’t even that many characters in this book. And we’re following the majority of them starting in the 1950s. Not exactly, y’know, the peak of support for diversity in America. AND STILL WE DON’T LACK FOR REPRESENTATION. Do you get how great that is? I’m ready to punch the whitesplainers of Disney’s Frozen in their boring pale faces. The word “Frozen” is actually a reference to the lack of movement in the creativity centers of their brains. (Follow for more behind the scenes Disney-Pixar facts.)This book includes three (three!) interracial relationships. Actually, it’s more like ten if you count the fact that our protagonist is Latina. Yes! This may be the bare minimum, but I’m so used to YA wherein one pale as snow teen romances a - gasp - pale aspaperteen! Diversity in young adult books = one character is of Western European descent and the other Eastern European. Talk about a vanilla romance. (Buh dum ch.)This book proves how important it is to provide diversity. The difference in the believability and intricacy of the story is incredible.I will say we don’t often get a good look at the variance in culture that comes with diversity here. Evelyn Hugo, though the daughter of Cuban immigrants, purposefully represses her heritage in order to fit in with the whitewashed 1950s and ’60s cinema scene. Our narrator, though half-black, expresses a fear that someone will tell her she’s “not black enough.” I wish the ethnic diversity played a little more into the text, but it didn’t feel unrealistic or anything. The reasoning was explained.But there’s even more diversity. Like, it gets even better. Because, again, despite the time setting, this book contains A SH*T TON of LGBT+ rep. And these are some of the most beautifully portrayed LGBT+ relationships I’ve ever read. If you don’t read this book for anything else, read it for that fine-ass inclusion, boi.Beyond that, this is the ultimate guilty pleasure book. IT IS SO FUN READING ABOUT OLD HOLLYWOOD AND OLD MOVIES. I wanted to watch the entire Evelyn Hugo canon after this, and then it was like, oh wait, she’s not real.I don’t have much else to say. This is chick-lit-y historical fiction at its finest. It’s just so fun. Some people say they got bored halfway through, and I get why you could, but I didn’t. I really fell in love with the world of this book, and the depiction of Old Hollywood, and all that jazz.A lot is revealed over the course of the book, and the best part is just being surprised at each twist and turn, so I don’t want to go to specifics even a little. I’m just going to cut off this review here before I risk, like, accidentally mentioning that Evelyn Hugo’s third husband turned her into a vampire and she was a vampire the whole time and she turns Monique at the end of the book.*Damn it!Bottom line: This is very fun and cool and maybe even important. Read it!!!*This isn’t true, by the way. Duh.----------------------rereading updateswas tempted to spend my whole day watching old movies and not reading at all.compromised by rereading this instead.this was a very good plan.----------------------pre-reviewThis book? It's really great.I got a hell of a lot more than I bargained for.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""This right here. This is why I read. For the joy and privilege of coming across an exquisite story like this and being swept up in its magic.CouldThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoreally be fiction, dreamt up entirely in Taylor Jenkins Reid's mind? Every moment felt so real, so tangible. When I reached the end, it was hard to let go, hard to return to a world where this was nothing more than a figment of the imagination.Evelyn Hugo, revered Hollywood actress and icon, is finally ready to tell the story of her life. But she wants to make sure that whatever comes out is authentic to who she is. So she contacts Monique Grant, a mostly unknown writer, to be her scribe. Everyone is surprised by the choice, no one more so than Monique herself. But to be given the chance to write Evelyn's memoir and to understand the person behind the legend is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, one that Monique can't pass up.When I first started this, I thought I was in for a fluffy, gossipy romance set in the golden Hollywood era. After all, why would anyone need so many husbands unless one was in it for a good time? But this turned out to be so much more. At its heart, it's a stunning and brutally honest portrayal of love in all its different forms. It shows not just the joy of love, but also its sacrifices and heartbreaks.I was blown away by how complex of a character Evelyn Hugo is. She is the heart and soul of this story, and her character shines so bright, it's hard to look away. She feels real, coming off the pages wholly formed. She's not perfect. In fact, her flaws and numerous questionable actions make her human, and it's easy to relate to her and cheer for her.The book is written in alternative viewpoints, a little bit from Monique's perspective as she interviews Evelyn and a lot from Evelyn's perspective as she shares the story of her life. When a book has two different viewpoints, there's always a fear that one is more interesting than the other. But not here. I can honestly say that every moment of this book was equally riveting.I adored Reid's writing style. It's filled with so much charm that it just oozes off the pages. The story obviously tackles serious issues, but the writing never takes itself too seriously. It's witty and funny, drawing me in and making me feel every emotion. It manages to convey so much nuance without ever slowing down the pacing or seeming long-winded. I'm in awe.You guys know I'm a romantic through and through. And this story is all about finding and holding on to that great love of your life, no matter what it takes. I mean, how could I not be drawn to that? I'm also a realist and I know that love takes so much sacrifice. So this story spoke to my heart and my mind.I never really had a chance. This book had me good and hooked, right from the first page. It's the sort of story I know I'll come back to again and again, savoring it anew every time.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:Carrie Soto Is BackDaisy Jones & The SixMalibu Rising~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧This was a pick for my Book of the Month box.

It's not the kind of thing I usually pick up, and I haven't read anything by Reid before. But something about it intrigued me. So I checked out the kindle sample. Just a couple chapters, I figured, because I probably wouldn't like it anyway.And I was HOOKED.It's perfect, easy beach read material. It's not particularly deep, it does not take the genre to new levels or make you think about something new, and yet it DID feel different. Evelyn Hugo's story was sodelicious and compellingthat it stood out, and kept me turning pages in a desperate need to discover the stories behind her seven husbands, and the answer to the one question everyone wants to know: who was her greatest love?The framing of the story reminded me a lot ofThe Thirteenth Tale. Like that book, inThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, a young woman - this time an ambitious journalist called Monique Grant - goes to interview an elderly woman. UnlikeThe Thirteenth Tale, this elderly woman happens to be one of the most famous actresses in the world.Evelyn Hugo has lived a life in the public eye, but she is full of secrets. Only she knows what happened behind the scenes in her long career of scandals and highly-publicized heartbreaks. Just like the fictional world of the book longed to know the truth-- so did I. Reid and Evelyn's habit of giving you just enough to leave you wanting more was incredibly exciting. Throughout, we are encouraged to wonder why someone like Evelyn Hugo would specifically request a relatively-inexperienced journalist like Monique. Why Monique? What is Evelyn hiding?The more I got to know Evelyn, the more I fell in love with her. She has made a lot of controversial decisions during her career, but she knows it and she also knows she'd probably do it all again. She's played the Hollywood game, dated famous men to further her career, and used her body to get what she wants. She has experienced the full force of the industry's sexism and, in some ways, capitalized on it. She is deeply flawed and aware of it. She has traded important aspects of her identity for more fame, more roles, more money. She was a badass Cuban woman working in an industry that didn't like women to be badass or Cuban. She manipulated and she lied.Despite everything - and because of it - I liked her.I stayed fully engrossed in the story of Evelyn Hugo - and of Monique Grant - from the opening chapters when Evelyn demanded an interview with only Monique, through decades of Hollywood in all its shimmering ugliness, right until the ending's final reveals.I enjoyed every moment.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Best rereading choice for flashback Saturday is re-devouring my all time favorite TJR book!Evelyn Hugo a. k. a.

She befriends 35 years old Monique Grant, an unknown reporter works for “Vivant” in Los Angeles. Even the boss of Monique has no clue why this Hollywood legend demanded to work with her: she could choose someone more experienced, popular, known in the industry.So many question balloons start to fly above our heads:- Why Evelyn wants to talk only Monique and if she doesn’t, the memoir deal will be off?- Why Evelyn married seven times. Did she love any of her husbands? Does she have resentments? Does she suffer from heartbreak? Which one of is the love of her life?-As soon as their interview starts, Evelyn takes her an adventurous train ride with full of juicy, entertaining, heartbreaking, emotional stories starting from glamorous 60’s of La La Land, the productions of her famous movies, how her path crossed with those men, how she saved them and they saved her, how she got hurt, how she shone, how she burned… and eventually a big secret reveals about her life story which will change everything about true identity of Evelyn and the life choices she’s made!It’s brilliant! It’s unputdownable, addictive, heartfelt time travel in Hollywood.

Don’t do that.”“You do not know how fast you have been running, how hard you have been working, how truly exhausted you are, until somewhat stands behind you and says, “It’s OK, you can fall down now. I’ll catch you.”“Heartbreak is a loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.”""Do you understand what I\'m telling you? When you\'re given an opportunity to change your life, be ready to do whatever it takes to make it happen. The world doesn\'t give things, you take things.

It is a favorite of the year, it will be a favorite of all time. I am wholly enchanted byThe Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugoand I will never forget how much I adore this book.CW: domestic abuse, death/grief, homophobia/biphobia, racismabortion & suicideAdult fiction is not typically my cup of tea, especially a combination of historical fiction and contemporary with the amount of long flashbacks (flashbacks: ALSO NOT MY THING). I have no idea how this combination of literary elements I typically do not like consumed my entire being, but it did. Taylor Jenkins Reid is an immensely talented author. Her prose is beautiful, vivid, and descriptive. There isn’t a moment throughout this story where I was bored or underwhelmed. Every second of this book is completely engaging – it was a huge struggle to put the book down.Evelyn Hugo is one of the greatest literary characters I have ever had the pleasure to read from. The exploration of her Cuban heritage and bisexuality is fascinating, especially given the era and her celebrity status. She is one of those intoxicating characters you will never be able to purge from your mind with her strong will, her independence, her strength, her cunning, and her compassion. Evelyn Hugo is unforgettable in my mind and hearing her story was one of the greatest pleasures I think I have ever experienced as a reader.Personally, I didn’t LOVE Monique, though I am always happy to see another biracial main character in literature. I appreciated her contribution to the story as I feel the book would lose some of it’s strength if there was not another character for Evelyn to explain her actions and motivations to and it was just her story, but it’s for that reason that I sometimes felt she was more of a plot device than an individual character. Compared to Evelyn, I just did not care for Monique’s individual life and problems. I enjoyed seeing how Evelyn influenced her life, but her storyline was so drab compared to Evelyn. Edit 4/3/2019 - After a second read, I GREATLY appreciate Monique. Her character is so nuanced and necessary to the story. I totally relinquish much of my initial feelings on her.The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugois one of my favorite books OF ALL TIME.

This book came in and knocked me off my feet.Monique is working for Vivant, a media company, when she is requested to interview Evelyn Hugo, a very famous movie actress, who has refused to give interviews for years. Evelyn starts to reveal her story to Monique, that life isn\'t perfect, that people are more than just one thing, that relationships are complicated, the power of forgiveness and reinvention, the idea of family, loss, and accepting the choices of others.This book had such depth and tackled so many issues. One of them was the concept of divorce. Growing up in a Baptist church, divorce was viewed as the ultimate sin. As soon as anyone heard that someone was divorced, they had a permanent scarlet letter attached to them. However, as I matured, life isn\'t nearly as black and white. Do you really know what happened? Did the man beat this woman and then run off with all of the money, just to teach her a lesson? Why does society still think it is OK to stigmatize divorced people?There were a tremendous amounts of very quotable quotes, and this was one of those rare books that you hope never has to end.""There are people who see a beautiful flower and rush over to pick it.""This book also tackled some of the issues that women face. ""Oh, I know the whole world prefers a woman who doesn\'t know her power, but I\'m sick of all that.""

It reminded me of the family sagas of the yore, kind of likeThe Thorn Birds. Only this book needed another 300 pages to dig deeper into the dramas of Evelyn's life and her psyche. I was entertained by the events of Hugo's Hollywood adventures, but ultimately this book lacks depth. Nobody else noticed how superficial everything is in this novel - relationships, emotions, portrayals of race and queerness?The novel is framed as a biography written by a talented up-and-coming jornalist, but reads as if thrown together by an employee of a gossip rag, who included all of the salacious parts of a famous person's life, but none of that person's interiority.Totally see why it's a bestseller.

What does she have for someone like the legend Evelyn Hugo wants her to write a book about her life? That\'s the interesting part.So, Monique goes to Evelyn\'s aparment and listens her story. From how Evelyn lost her mother and how she swored she would get out of Hell\'s Kitchen, away from her father and poverty, and because her mother dreamt with became someone famous and live in Hollywood one day. She was born Evelyn Elena Herrera, daughter of Cuban parents, but had to change her name by Evelyn Hugo.She talks about how she made her way to L.A, how much she sacrificed and her husbands, of course.My 3 favorite husbands are: Rex North (he was one of my 3 favorite marriages) to get more money for the movie their starring: Anna Karenina (the gods know how I much love Anna Karenina, so I\'d have given my kidney or soul to see that movie).

I don't think I've ever had as immediate a reaction as I did to reading this book. I feel like my updates have made my distaste for this book pretty evident, but in case it wasn't I'm going to walk through all the things I hated about this book one final time before I try and put as much space between me and this work of fiction as humanly possible.I knew going into the book that Evelyn Hugo was a Latinx character, it wasn't until I started reading though that I discovered our other narrator, Monique, was also a woman of color. [ Don't call her black though, she's biracial. ] And almost immediately I was uncomfortable with this ide. That said I carried on thinking that I was probably just stretching, reaching for things that weren't there. That said I think that the narrative utterly fails at the nuance necessary to tell the story of a Cuban-American finding success in the 50s. Utterly fails to depict the nuance in the way that someone like Evelyn would have to navigate the world, or how her racial identity would have had an impact on most of the things she experienced in life. It's really only brought up at the beginning when she's initially denied roles and Evelyn immediately pivots into this racially ambiguous/spicy white category that she's happy with becuase it ensures her success. That doesn't stop her from later bing mad that her maid doesn't know she's Cuban even though she's actively tried to supress that side of her for literally decades. I won't even get into how the narrative makes Evelyn retiring to Spain to make tortillas her reconnecting with her Cuban roots or how Monique actively distances heself from blackness while never questioning the impact that being raised by a single white mother following the death of her black father might have any role in that. You really mean to tell me that she has memories of her father but not his family? That the first black person she met was a girl in elementary school? Okay. Sidenote Evelyn just randomly dropping that she supported civil rights and MLK Jr towards the end of the book felt totally out of place and while not a big deal that part of the book felt very disconnected from what else was going on.I didn't feel attached to any of the characters really, let alone any of the seven husbands. I have ones I thought were more interesting, but that's only because so did TJR and they were the ones given more time on the page. None of the characters that appear in the novel though are nearly as developed as Evelyn Hugo, something that I think makes it easier for a reader to be drawn to. There is literally no one else. No one is given the time or energy, even the major players in her life. I didn't think that the love story between Evelyn and the person that would be the lover her life was all that compelling if anything I thought that that person was actually lowkey terrible and the romance they shared was almost certainly nothing to write home about.There are a number of deaths in this book, and again, didn't care about any of them.At the end of the day though I did enjoy the voice of Evelyn Hugo, the character to be clear. Though the most revolutionary thing about her is being a bisexual character in their 70s, there's just something about characters like Evelyn that I will always support and that's no different here. Again though it helps that Evelyn is easily the only character crafted with any kind of depth.I can't in good faith recommend that anyone read this book. I got very little enjoyment, but also there is nothing to gain? I realize and appreciate that my thoughts are in the minority here and I in no way feel like my opinion will ever be the one most agree with. If you do decide to pick this up I hope that you are able to enjoy it in ways I couldn't.Also just a warning but this book details incestuous thoughts of child sexual assault, actual child sexual assault/pedophilia, and abuse in general [ definitely physical, emotional up for discussion I'd say ] so just know that if you want to pick this up.2022 re-read thoughtsI wish that I could say that I liked this more the second time, but that would be a lie...Or at least, partly a lie. I don't think that I can raise the rating even if I objectively had a better time reading it knowing the full scope of the story I was going to be getting. Maybe the gut punch of the end of the book being so insensitive being taken out of the equation was enough for me to have a better time, I don't know.I do think that there are elements that work well here. I still think that Evelyn is an interesting character to follow with a very distinctive voice that I would appreciate in the hands of any other author. I feel comfortable saying that because I have enjoyed many a character that share her achetype.For me the ways that race were handled poorly weren't so glaringly annoying this time as much as Celia being a horrible character. From the microaggressions at the first time she and Evelyn have a meal together to the way that she acts for years toward Evelyn. It never comes across as a 'good for her' moment, her standing up for herself... but as shaming Evelyn for doing things that she herself is not doing? Shaming Evelyn for making choices that are good for both of them. I get that communication is hard... but Celia and Evelyn take this to a whole new level. It was childish. It didn't serve love of her life... It didn't serve the one that got away. I deserved better as a reader quite frankly.All of that is to say that the book giving 20ish pages to the explanation as to why Monique was chosen for this opportunity... still by far the worst part of the book. Everything about that getting wrapped up is so rushed. While the whole book feels very surface level, that in particular is damn near unforgivable. Monique deserved better as a character, the readers deserves more, and that TJR thought it was acceptable is pure foolishness.I still think everyone who has wanted to read this has read it at this point... But it really shouldn't be on anyone's tbr. It's definitely not worth the time, even with all the potential this story has.""}]"

Addressed in green ink on yellowish parchment with a purple seal, they are swiftly confiscated by his grisly aunt and uncle. Then, on Harry's eleventh birthday, a great beetle-eyed giant of a man called Rubeus Hagrid bursts in with some astonishing news: Harry Potter is a wizard, and he has a place at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. An incredible adventure is about to begin!","[{'rating': 4, 'content': '(A-) 83%| Very GoodNotes:An effortless enchantment, it\'s lush with warmth and lore: seeded well, it casts a spell, and leaves you wanting more.*Check out progress updates for detailed commentary:Progress updates:01/11/2020- Preamble(1) After nearly 9 months, I finally finished all five ""A Song of Ice and Fire"" audiobooks, I was going to run a poll on what I should listen to next but, c\'mon, let\'s be real.(2) I decided on the Stephen Fry version over Jim Dale simply because I can\'t abide by ""Sorcerer\'s Stone."" It\'s ""Philosopher\'s Stone"" for me or no stones at all!01/12/2020- 9%(1) ""People in cloaks! Mr. Dursley couldn\'t bear people who dressed in funny clothes – the getups you saw on young people!""- With the movies, it\'s easy to forget that everyday wizard attire involves brightly colored cloaks and pointy hats.(2) McGonagall: ""There will be books written about Harry – every child in our world will know his name!""01/13/2020- 16%(1) Harry gets Dudley\'s second room, which seems very much like the Room of Requirement. It\'s used to hide Dudley\'s disused and broken things, but now functions as a bedroom.(2) If this snake was bred in captivity, and doesn\'t often speak to humans, how does it speak Portuguese? I suppose there\'s some Parseltongue iteration of Portuguese.01/14/2020- 23%(1) Hagrid: ""\'The gold ones are Galleons,\' he explained. \'Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle.\'""- It\'s interesting that despite UK decimalization, wizards still use a kind of £sd currency. They\'re sort of American that way: resisting metric.(2) A knut is a wizard penny, I presume after King Cnut the Great.01/15/2020- 34%(1) Harry: ""What are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?""Hagrid: ""School houses. There\'s four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o\' duffers, but–""Harry: ""I bet I\'m in Hufflepuff,"" said Harry gloomily.""- Hufflepuff does sound like it\'s for stoners.(2) Ron\'s both shocked and impressed that Harry said ""Voldemort."" Sort of like cursing, uttering his name.01/16/2020- 43%(1) ""Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head. \'GRYFFINDOR!\' shouted the hat. Ron groaned.""- And thus begins our enemies-to-lovers romance.(2) ""Ickle"" must be Britishism of Britishisms. I\'ve only ever seen it in ""Harry Potter"" books.(3) Hope my GIFs are well-received. Let me know if they ever get annoying.01/17/2020- 55%(1) ""The students all hated [Filch], and it was the dearest ambition of many to give Mrs. Norris a good kick.""- Well, as long as they don\'t actually kick the cat.(2) Re: Football: ""Ron couldn\'t see what was exciting about a game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly.""- I dislike soccer for separate, non-magical, reasons.01/18/2020- 62%(1) Ron saves Hermione from the troll. When it comes to Hermione, Harry\'s invariably placid, it\'s always fireworks with Ron.(2) Before I knew better, I used to think ""Hermione"" was pronounced ""hermy-won.""(3) ""Ron was fascinated by the fifty pence. \'Weird!\' he said, \'What a shape! This is money?\'""- I guess heptagons aren\'t common among wizards.01/19/2020- 69%(1) The problem with the library\'s ""restricted section"" is that anyone can go there. Just keep them locked in a separate room, there must be hundreds of those available.(2) Remembralls are about as useful as tying string around your finger.(3) Harry: ""How did you know – ?""Dumbledore: ""I don\'t need a cloak to become invisible.""- Totally pwned!01/20/2020- 73%(1) “Ron and Hermione [were] playing chess. Chess was the only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good for her.”- I agree, it keeps her humble and open to suggestions.- It’s good for Ron too, having something he’s best at.(2) I love how openly biased teachers are toward their houses. It makes them more human.01/21/2020- 77%(1) Ron and Neville fist fight Malfoy, Crabbe & Goyle. If you ask me, Malfoy\'s Ron\'s nemesis not Harry\'s.(2) ""Hermione... had started drawing up study schedules and color coding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn\'t have minded, but she kept nagging them to do the same.""- Pressuring idiosyncrasies is weird... like making friends dress like you.01/22/2020- 84%(1) Filch: ""Hang you by your wrists... I\'ve got the chains still in my office, keep \'em well oiled in case they\'re ever needed.""- Not an awful idea, motives aside. Manacles can be handy.(2) ""Snape made them all nervous... while they tried to remember how to make a Forgetfulness potion.""- Trick question! Potion fumes might cause them to forget!01/23/2020- 90%(1) The difference between J.K. Rowling and Rick Riordan is that Rowling plays the long game, building scenes toward the climax. Whereas Riordan plays in short bursts, ping-ponging from one mini-quest to another. Here, for example, Ron being best at chess, Hagrid giving Harry a flute, Peeves being scared of the Bloody Baron, etc., all pay-off at the climax.01/24/2020- 90%(1) Dumbledore: ""Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use the proper name for things. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.""- Wonder why Dumbledore doesn\'t give this advice to everyone? Surely people would listen.(2) Lost in the narrative is that Harry kills a guy. Literally kills him with the power of love... it\'s a curious thing.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Publishers have my sympathy. If I try to put myself in the place of an editor picking this manuscript from the pile I can say with some certainty that I would not have recognized it as the ticket to a multi-billion dollar prize. I would have thought to myself that it was a good fun read, revisiting the magic-school trope and doing a fine job for children in the 8 to 12 range. If I hadn\'t had anything better land on my desk I might have published it, but then again, like quite a number of publishers, I might have passed in favour of a book I liked better.I read this maybe 15 years back so I could share in what was exciting my three kids at the time. And I\'ve read it twice to my daughter, Celyn. We read the first 5 some years back, and now she\'s 12 we\'re going to read the whole lot. She\'s very disabled and can\'t read for herself (she can\'t hold the book or see the page for starters...)Having just finished I\'ve checked the shelves to discover we have two copies of book 1 and two copies of book 3, but none of book 2. So JKR will be getting some more of my money shortly!To the review... I liked the book. I have no idea why it has sold a gazzilion copies more than any other children\'s book or why so many adults are so taken with it. JKR writes solid enough prose, though her addiction to adverbs in dialogue tags irks me no end, he said testily. She writes a fun and inventive story, though the internal inconsistencies would have distressed me even as a child. Why do the finest wizards in the land leave a great treasure guarded only by a series of puzzles rather than actual defences? If in the final scenes the puzzle poem hadn\'t been left to give the solution to the potion test ... or the key hadn\'t been left in the same room as the door that wouldn\'t yield to magic ... would that not have been a better way to defend the treasure? Yes ... it was more fun this way, but ... dammit ... kids aren\'t stupid...But yes, funny and inventive magic, school dynamics of making friends and enemies, the hijinx, the evil baddie, the chosen one... it\'s all good. Celyn certainly enjoyed it. She\'s on team Hermionie.The only other thing that really bothered me was the repeated insinuation, present even in the term itself, that \'muggles\' are somehow lesser. That the random gift of magical ability somehow makes you better.I remember that later on (and hinted at in this book) the idea of mud-bloods (wizards born of muggles) is offered up as a proxy for racism and we\'re invited to condemn Draco Malfoy for his views (rightly so). But all the time I read this I\'m feeling the hypocrisy embodied in the whole idea of muggles, which, albeit voiced without open malice, is really the same damn thing.I will report back on book 2 when we\'re done.EDITED IN FROM THE COMMENTS:>>Aliyah wrote: ""Personally I believe the trope is so familiar to you because of JK Rowling. She made this style of fantasy more popular."">My reply: Personal beliefs are fine and dandy, but in this instance ... badly wrong.My first encounter with magic schools was in The Worst Witch series (1974) which centres on a magic school and which I began in 1974. Followed by A Wizard of Earthsea (1968) which also centres on a magic school and which I read in 1975.The mechanics of reaching a boarding school on a dedicated train laid on for the purpose and of sorting a boarding school into four groups to be housed in four towers was something I encountered at a still younger age in the early 70s in my mother\'s copy of First Term at Malory Towers (1946).Join my PatreonJoin my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes...'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Stuck at home?Got some time on your hands?

Hoggy Hoggy warty warts.I think at this point, everyone and their great-great-grandmother has heard of this book.Harry Potter, orphaned before he was one, was sent to live with his Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon. He was always a bit ofan odd child- much to his family's dismay.Things just...happened...around him. Like when he was running from bullies and jumped to the school roof. Or when he got an atrocious haircut (courtesy of Aunt Petunia) and all of his hair grew back in a single night.On his eleventh birthday, a letter comes to him anda whole new world opensin front of his eyes.In short - I LOVED THIS ONE. I thought I loved the Harry Potter books when I first read them, but when I bought the illustrated version...well, that love instantly quadrupled.The fully illustrated Philosopher's Stone still has all the wonder and amazement as the boy-turned-wizard embarks on a harrowing 7-book-adventure and the illustrations bring a whole new dimension.Seriously, I can't emphasize enough how much I love this book.Just look at these images - they're magnificent:Ahh! Just look at sad, tiny Harry. Don't worry kid - life will get better!Not only are thesefull-color, high quality imagesbut there are somanyof them.Often, illustrated books have a picture here or there but not HP. There'spages and pages of pictureslike this - and often the pages without full-sized images will have a small illustrations here and there between the large ones.Words cannot express how highly I recommend this one.

They are now old enough to start appreciating the story so I thought it would be fun to read it out loud to them. While it did take us a while because, you know . . . life happens . . . we were able to find a few minutes every few nights or so to read a chapter or part of a chapter. It was really fun to see them getting into it.They are looking forward to watching the movie and starting in on the Chamber of Secrets!Original review:One of my first jobs was at a bookstore. When I was a kid my Mom would take me to the mall and I would spend tons of time hanging out at Waldenbooks (who here remembers Waldenbooks?) Right when I became legally old enough to work, I went in and submitted my application and a few weeks later I was selling literature to the masses.Why do I tell you this story on this review, you ask? Well, at the time, young adult/teen literature consisted mainly of RL Stein, Christopher Pike, Beverly Cleary, Judy Blume, and a few other classic Newberry Award winners, but certainly we did not have a YA section to the extent you see it today.Towards the end of my tenure at Waldenbooks - as Oprah's book club was hitting its stride and Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus was in its bazzilionth week on the New York Times best seller list - a book display arrived featuring a buzzy new title about a certain boy wizard. I remember the display at the front of the store, and selling a few copies, but I didn't realize what it would become.A few years later (early 2000s), I had kinda gotten out of the loop on what was big in books. I had just finished college, which had taken up most of my free reading time. A friend of mine named Bronco (yup, real name, not a nickname, who also was the Best Man at my wedding) had a copy of this book on his coffee table. Holy cow! Here is that same book we were selling at Waldenbooks about 5 years before - what was he doing with it!?Well, he said it was good, so I borrowed it. I quickly plowed through the first 4 books and then got the pleasure of joining the world in waiting for the release of Order of the Phoenix. And, I noticed when I went to the bookstore, the YA section and selection was not so small anymore. I truly believe it was Harry Potter that opened the door to get more young adults (and even adults, of course) reading and authors interested in writing for that genre.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I\'m going to keep this brief since there isn\'t much to say that hasn\'t already been said. *clears throat*I think the reason I waited so long to read this series is because I just couldn\'t imagine myself enjoying reading about an eleven-year-old boy and his adventures at a school of wizardry. I thought it would be too juvenile for my taste. I was wrong, of course.I can honestly say that I loved every minute of this. It\'s a spectacular little romp with funny, courageous, and endearing characters that you can\'t help but love.It has talking chess pieces, singing hats, a giant three-headed dog named Fluffy, a hilarious giant with a dragon fetish, a master wizard that\'s just a little bit crazy, mail carrier owls, goblins running a bank, unicorns, centaurs(!), trolls . . . and probably much more that I\'m forgetting.And then there\'s the lead characters: Hermione, the young scholar who starts out prim and up-tight but soon becomes a true friend; Ron, the boy who has little money but who has an abundance of family and loyalty to his friends to make up for it; and then there\'s Harry, the boy who starts out sleeping in a closet and ends up being a hero. Harry is kind to those that deserve it, fearless when it counts the most, and wonderfully intelligent. What\'s not to love?In regards to the ending:I feel silly saying this about a middle grade novel, but I didn\'t suspect Quirrell a bit! If there were hints that he was the true culprit and not Snape, I obviously missed them.FAVORITE QUOTE:""But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can\'t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.""Now, if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m off to startHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.*******************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'My original review was a comparison of sorts between Harry Potter and Twilight. However, this is stupid as the two are incomparable. Honestly, its not even worth discussing. Its not just that Twilight doesn\'t come close, it is the fact that Harry Potter transcends other similar works. Its peerless. To quote Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction: It""ain\'t the same fuckin\' ballpark, it ain\'t the same league, it ain\'t even the same fuckin\' sport.""There was a day when I thought I needed to defend Harry Potter, in the midst of the now dead Twilight craze, and you can see that below in what was my original review. It is a testament to the power of this series, that while various other franchises (Twilight, Hunger Games) have surged into popularity and then faded, Harry Potter remains unwaveringly strong after nineteen years. It is clear readers hold just as much admiration for these books as they always have. Time has not dimmed that.I will, one day, write an essay about what these books mean to me. Eternal, this is the one that started it all.Original review (circa 2010)A note in regard to the on-going Potter vs Twilight debate:Go ahed, tell meTwilightis better.Tell me that James is scarier than Voldemort,That the Cullens are a better family than the Weasly\'sThat Edward is cooler than Harry,and Bella is smarter than Hermione.Tell me thatStephenie Meyeris more talented thanJ.K. Rowling.Go ahead,I dare you.Those who think the topic of Harry Potter or Twilight is worth debating and arguing over,are utterly stupid.Quite frankly-this book is amazing.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Rereading for the 3rd time for the group read.Once upon a time, there was a 10th grader named Khanh who didn\'t get along with people very well. She wasn\'t an outcast in school, and all the bullying and teasing stopped with the commencement of high school, but she had always been a bookworm and has generally preferred the company of her own thoughts.Lunchtime had always been dedicated not to eating, but to sitting in the library, browsing through books.(Not to worry, she got her nutrition in 5th period in the form of a giant 6-inch M&M studded cookie and a package of Sour Patch Kids and/or a package of Reese\'s Pieces. Ah, the effortless metabolism of youth.)One day, there were shiny new books on her school library\'s ""New Releases"" shelf. Harry Potter, books 1 through 3. She had heard of the books before, of course, since they were a constant presence on the NYT bestsellers list, but she had always avoided them, thinking of them as children\'s novels.At the grand age of 14, surely she was too old for a little kid\'s fantasy novel. She had read theOutlanderseries earlier that year, after all. And it had sex in it. SEX! She didn\'t really quite understand everything in the book, but the point is, she had read them. Surely, at 14, Khanh was ready for more mature novels.And that did not include Harry Potter.Harry Potter is 11. Khanh is 14.There is a vast difference in their ages. Khanh was ateenager, dammit.But the Harry Potter books were new. Brand new. They were shiny, they had never been touched by another reader.

Initially, when I read it, I devoured it in two days. Now that I am old, well as old as Megan Fox, I wanted to hate on the author but couldn\'t.JK Rowling makes writing look easy. Her prose is easy to read out loud, very smooth. Although the world that she has created is magical, it isn\'t confusing or that difficult to imagine unlike LOTR or Dune. The book is also incredibly fast paced. Many of the fantasy books that I have read have at least 100 pages to warm up. So how does the author make us want to root or cheer for Harry? How do we become invested in him? He is an orphan and an abused orphan at that. On the one hand, this formula definitely works, but isn\'t it a little over done? JK Rowling also sets up some beautiful scenes like when Harry is receiving his invitation to Hogwarts. How many people actually try that hard? When Ron and Harry discover that Hermione is in danger, they both go to assist her. However, most people these days would go, ""Oh well."" Sorry my INFJ is showing.There were a few things that I didn\'t like:*Why does JK Rowling hate cats? Mr Dursley sees something odd, a cat reading a map. My cats play chess, play the piano, watch TV, and once even typed ""hi"" on my computer. I don\'t find reading a map to be a bit strange at all. Maybe my house is just brimming with magic and as a muggle I just don\'t know about it? Mrs. Figg also made Harry look at photographs of all of the cats that she has ever owned. As if that is some sort of punishment!*How Hermione is treated. When Ron and Harry are in trouble, Ron screams at her, ""Have you gone mad? Are you a witch or not?"" Um Ron, if you treat me like, you can save yourself. At the end of the book, Hermione is never fully rewarded for her portion in saving Ron and Harry, just figuring out the riddle. Even after she was a better person than I.*Quidditch and chess - not really my thing although this opened up a brilliant line of merchandising for the author.*Some things didn\'t make sense to me. Why was there a sip of the potions left? Why exactly was Dudley so popular at school?Now, I think a trip to Orlando is in order to visit the Wizarding World of Harry Potter!2025 Reading ScheduleJan\tA Town Like AliceFeb\tBirdsongMar\tCaptain Corelli\'s Mandolin - Louis De BerniereApr\tWar and PeaceMay\tThe Woman in WhiteJun\tAtonementJul\tThe Shadow of the WindAug\tJude the ObscureSep\tUlyssesOct\tVanity FairNov\tA Fine BalanceDec\tGerminalConnect With Me!BlogTwitterBookTubeFacebookInstaMy Bookstore at Pango'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Doing a listen of the entire series, Stephen Fry edition.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""This book was okay.

I appreciate the level of novelty in the world-building during the time this was first published. The friendship between the trio is cute. Hermione and Ron are fun characters and I might have enjoyed the book more if they had been the main protagonists. Downsides: I cringed at the excessive fatphobia, anti-semitism, and the turban part. I also didn't like that the final action of the book got skipped over quickly by having a fade-to-black moment and then a lengthy explanation told by one of the side characters.

It was just as wonderfully magical as I remembered, a breath of fresh air during what is usually a stressful time of year for me. I have yet to find a story that feels so pure and childlike that appeals to such a broad range of people. There’s something for everyone here; whether you are 10 or 100, Hogwarts is a place you can escape to and enjoy hearty adventures that you won’t find elsewhere.I truly love all of the characters and feel the entire cast is well done, but my personal favorites are the Weasley twins, Hagrid, and Professor McGonnall. While I’ve seen all the movies and know the general storyline, I’m really excited to experience the story “first hand” and see what all was left out from the films. I’m also intrigued to find out more about each house, especially the ones that took a backseat in this story.

Even those could be just electronic too, and the Books be just like Good Ol\' Video Tapes.A Dystopia, right? very gloomy idea to the world without This novel,The One.Well, in the case you think I\'m exaggerate..Let\'s have,ABrief !!History of Literature in the 90s-------------------------------Well, let’s back to early 90s , where TV is in every house, even in every room, Video sets are there too, rental video stores everywhere, satellite receivers and cable channels growing fast packed with channels for kids & teenagers, making them attached more & more into screens,not to mention Video Games, Game boy and Nintendo…Those of this new generation who read are “weirdos"" or ""nerds” to the rest of their peers.And for those “few who read”, book stores mostly got for them comics and graphic novels, which most of them created early this century.Classic Novels, they read just for Schools and Classes mostly.And New Novels that make Best Seller are the ones made, or will be made, into movies for Julia Roberts, Tom Cruse or any of the 90s Hollywood celebrity, or the ones by Stephen King because ,of course, will be made into movies too.Even these new novels didn\'t live up the selling numbers of Tolkien, Charles Dickens, Agatha Christie-what’s with the British authors and selling numbers :)?-, also in Russia no more Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, no more Hugo in France, inEgyptno more like Naguib Mahfouz & the great authors of the 50s to 70s..No new Big Hit for novels, most of the selling books are those of Speculation about strange & mysterious things in the world or in religion, Dream interpretation , cocking books or celebrities rumors.While in US & UK, Top Selling books mostly the Self Help ones, or those teaching Computers Programming and Web Sites-this brand new huge technology leap back then-No new novels to attract the new generation of kids and teenagers, There\'s few Successful Highlights though, like R.L.Stine’s Goosepumbs in 1992 which made a very good success, and translated in many countries including Egypt.And in Egypt there’s also a very successful project by respectful Publishing house that made “Pocket Novels” for youth, by brilliant Egyptian writers presenting huge variety of novels of many genres, Sci-Fi, Action Thriller, comics, Romance .etc.There’s also “Reading for All”, project by the first lady “Susan Mubarak”, reprinting a huge verity of important books and novels from all over the world in very cheap prices.But all these effort didn\'t attract “more and more” of new youth readers as intended, it just made more and more books for those few who already reads.The vast numbers of those who don’t just read will increase if there isn\'t a BIG new attractiveReading Experienceto get them into reading, specially with the more channels, more movies.But the BIGGEST Obstacle for them to read came out in1994, and became a real phenomenon by 1995....it’sPlaystation, The giant Japanese Gaming leap..Football, Crash, Pepsi man, even the comics heroes also have their games, so why reading Superman, Batman’s comics when you can play them..~~~~~~ A beat. ~~~~~~So by 1996, with this growing leap in Gaming, also the Computer 3D games getting much improved, Books get replaced bit by bit by a gaming controls.So do you think it’s wise for publishers to publish a book for new writer?Of course not, it may not even cover it’s publishing cost.So it was very normal when in this year, 1996, whenJoanne, a 31 years old lady from England , handed the manuscript of her first novel to 12 publishing houses, all of them rejected it...A manuscript of over 200 pages of a novel,that she had hard times in her personal and professional life while writing it,and for children??? Seriously is there still any Child left who still read? it’s 1996, the Era of Playstation and Video Games.But then, the Modest“Bloomsbury“agreed to publish it , with 2 advises for her, first that she’d get a day job, since it’s a little chance of making money in children\'s books.- later she received a grant from the Scottish Arts Council to help her continuing writing.-But the significant advice was to change her pen name cause young boys might not want to read a book written by a woman..So with her name & her grandmother’s ""Kathleen"" come the 2 initial of her pen name..J . k . RowlingAnd in26 June 1997, with 1,000 copies, 500 of which were distributed to libraries, come out in UK, to our World The Greatest..Harry Potter and the Philosopher\'s StoneAnd Bam!! , everything happened so fast..Before the end of this year the novel was awarded many important literary awards in the UK.An American important publisher, Scholastic, won the rights to publish the novel in US, with a huge check Rowling would never dreams of.Just with small change, \'Philosopher\'s Stone\' to be \'Sorcerer\'s Stone\', as the American publisher feared \'Philosopher\'s\' may not be that attractive to young readers..And Thanks to Harry Potter, now Every young readers worldwide know much more about Philosopher\'s Stone\'s legend.In1998Book Two released in UK ,1999in US, winning more literary prizes. And becoming NO.1 Top Selling Book in UK , US and many other countries which start to publish the translated first book.And on8 July 1999, TheFirst Breaking Recordmade when Book Three sold68.000 copiesin just three days after its release in the United Kingdom.. and more copies when it released late 1999 in US..With the fast growing popularity of Harry Potter among readers, more records had been broken..The 3 books takeover the Top Spot in all charts of Best Selling Books for weeks & months, and it\'s even still in hardcover editions.This conquer of the Top Spots made some literary magazines & newspapers separate the \'Harry Potter books\' selling records from the rest of the top selling books, splitting the lists into \'Children Books\' and \'Adult Books\' sections, under pressure from other publishers who were eager to see their books given higher ranking.And then it was year 2000 , where everything is about to change ... forever..The Playstation 2 is out there, and even higher leap in Computer Games..But even with this much of temptations, thousands of children, teens and parents gathered in the Midnight of8 July 2000in UK and US at the same day in front of stores, not in front of Cinemas as usual, not electronic stores as Apple storesas happening theses days, But it was in front ofBookstores, for The First time in the Book Stores History, to buy a copy of...Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireAnd They didn\'t mind to find out that the book is over 700 page, it was even for their pleasure, more than double the size of any of the first 3 novels.. double the thriller, double the fun..Over 3 million copies sold at that day only in the US , a New World Record, totally unexpected one.Huge story, bigger plot , mysterious and very well written.And more literate prizes for Rowling... more translated editions to more than 40 language.And a huge budget for the upcoming first movie of the series, which beautifully visualize the magic of the novel by the faithful producers and the director...and it also made some Cinematic Records back then,but that\'s not our subject now.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~With the announcement of pushing the publishing date of Book Five to mid. 2003 , and with 2 movies out so far, The Hunger for reading Harry Potter kept on..So, As more readers from this generation start to increase , Publishers and Book Stores start to promote for more books for those readers who are hungry for more..Older Fantasy books , like Lord of the Rings-which was a super successful movie by then too-Narnia , Golden Compass and many other novels start getting more reprinted editions. And so Book Stores prosperity increased as it get more and more readers.More countries welcomed the Harry Potter phenomenon.. The English edition AND the local translated ones , both been sold everywhere worldwide.Even inEgyptEnglish edition sold at many books stores. And, hopefully, some New Book Stores specialized in English novels and books start to open in Cairo & Alexandria by 2002-2003..And in summer 2002, after the Movie wild success, Nahdet Masr publishing house got the rights and published the Arabic edition.Although it cut some of the lines for length issues, the edition still hold the magic of it ..making a very good sales.~~~~~~ ~~~~~~The good news is, the literary movement didn\'t stop there, Harry Potter and Reprinted Classics. No , there\'s more new books come out for the increasing demand from the readers..By2002,Life of Pi, Man Booker winner make very good sales numbers.And inApril 2003Dan Brown(previously published 3 novels, making good sales)released a novel that made Huge Fuss around and making a new sales records,The Da Vinci Code..The funny thing that there\'s a reference in this novel that Harry Potter is \'the Second Most Selling Book in History after the Bible\', a speculation that happens to be true in less than 5 years after that.A month later,May 2003, Khaled Hosseini released his first novel,The Kate Runnerwhich also made a very good records too.-Don\'t you agree if there\'s no Harry Potter before, this Afghan-born author would have a chance? He\'d be rejected by 12 publishers like you know who :)-And all that didn\'t affect the main reason for this new \'Literal Renaissance\'.All that didn\'t affect the Records Breaker to break records one month later..On20 June 2003book Five\'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\'comes out..Ten thousands of all ages conquer the Book Stores in UK, US and other countries too at the same day to get The One Book they\'ve been waiting for at least 2 years.

Yes.Taking arms against Harry Potter, at this moment, is to emulate Hamlet taking arms against a sea of troubles. By opposing the sea, you won\'t end it. The Harry Potter epiphenomenon will go on, doubtless for some time, as J. R. R. Tolkien did, and then wane.The official newspaper of our dominant counter-culture, The New York Times, has been startled by the Potter books into establishing a new policy for its not very literate book review. Rather than crowd out the Grishams, Clancys, Crichtons, Kings, and other vastly popular prose fictions on its fiction bestseller list, the Potter volumes will now lead a separate children\'s list. J. K. Rowling, the chronicler of Harry Potter, thus has an unusual distinction: She has changed the policy of the policy-maker.Imaginative VisionI read new children\'s literature, when I can find some of any value, but had not tried Rowling until now. I have just concluded the 300 pages of the first book in the series, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone,"" purportedly the best of the lot. Though the book is not well written, that is not in itself a crucial liability. It is much better to see the movie, ""The Wizard of Oz,"" than to read the book upon which it was based, but even the book possessed an authentic imaginative vision. ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone"" does not, so that one needs to look elsewhere for the book\'s (and its sequels\') remarkable success. Such speculation should follow an account of how and why Harry Potter asks to be read.The ultimate model for Harry Potter is ""Tom Brown\'s School Days"" by Thomas Hughes, published in 1857. The book depicts the Rugby School presided over by the formidable Thomas Arnold, remembered now primarily as the father of Matthew Arnold, the Victorian critic-poet. But Hughes\' book, still quite readable, was realism, not fantasy. Rowling has taken ""Tom Brown\'s School Days"" and re-seen it in the magical mirror of Tolkein. The resultant blend of a schoolboy ethos with a liberation from the constraints of reality-testing may read oddly to me, but is exactly what millions of children and their parents desire and welcome at this time.In what follows, I may at times indicate some of the inadequacies of ""Harry Potter."" But I will keep in mind that a host are reading it who simply will not read superior fare, such as Kenneth Grahame\'s ""The Wind in the Willows"" or the ""Alice"" books of Lewis Carroll. Is it better that they read Rowling than not read at all? Will they advance from Rowling to more difficult pleasures?Rowling presents two Englands, mundane and magical, divided not by social classes, but by the distinction between the ""perfectly normal"" (mean and selfish) and the adherents of sorcery. The sorcerers indeed seem as middle-class as the Muggles, the name the witches and wizards give to the common sort, since those addicted to magic send their sons and daughters off to Hogwarts, a Rugby school where only witchcraft and wizardry are taught. Hogwarts is presided over by Albus Dumbeldore as Headmaster, he being Rowling\'s version of Tolkein\'s Gandalf. The young future sorcerers are just like any other budding Britons, only more so, sports and food being primary preoccupations. (Sex barely enters into Rowling\'s cosmos, at least in the first volume.)----------------------------The first half of a little piece I wrote from theJournalin July 2000.

So here it is again, may it stick around this time!”It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live, remember that.”Okay, here’s the thing: There are already 96.502 reviews about this book on goodreads and I think it’s safe to say that mine will carry no weight. *lol*So I decided to make this a short “my thoughts about this book” review. ;-P1.)”Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”I totally forgot how horrible the Dursleys are and I think I kind of suppressed how dreadful Dudley is! Such a spoilt brat and this is actually putting it more than just lightly. If anyone should go to a boot camp sort of school it certainly should be him.2.)”Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry – yer a wizard.”Bless Hagrid for being the kind and compassionate man that he is! <3 Those lines went down in Harry Potter history and started it all! XD3.)”Blown up a toilet? We’ve never blown up a toilet.”“Great idea though, thanks, Mum.”Haha! You gotta love the Weasley twins! They might be side characters but they always manage to bring some humour into the book and they succeed to give that typical sibling and family vibe. =)4.)”Are you sure that’s a real spell?” said the girl. “Well, it’s not very good, is it? I’ve tried a few simple spells just for practice and it’s all worked for me.”When I read this I totally had the Hermione of the movie in my mind. Emma Watson played her so well and I’m really glad that Hermione came off her high horse. She was really insufferable at the beginning of the book. *lol*5.)”You’ll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don’t want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there.”Urgh! And so it begins! I never liked Malfoy and I’ll never do. Sorry, guys! Yes, I felt sorry for him after book 5 but he’s still a slimy little spoilt brat at the beginning of the series. Still, if his parents would have raised him differently he might have even turned out to be a nice guy. *sighs*6.)”Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?”And here comes another character I’ll never forgive. Snape is a horrible teacher and an even worse human being. There I said it. Nothing that happens over the course of the following books will change anything about the fact that he’s unfair and mean to his students! His past doesn’t excuse his actions. Still, I gotta give Rowling kudos for all the foreboding! Boy, alone the comment with the bezoar. XD And Dumbledore explaining the relationship between Snape and Harry’s father. Well done! ;-)7.)”But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.”I still love that scene and I’m really glad Hermione and the others finally bonded. Also, I love that they tried to be good kids at the beginning. In the first book they actually don’t want to do anything forbidden and feel bad about it. Well, and then the other books happen. *LOL* Apparently practice makes perfect though, because they go for plenty of forbidden things but don’t get caught anymore. Haha!8.)”All right, all right. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I’m sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor, taken by Spinnet, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still in possession.”Lee Jordan is the best! <3 He’s the main reason I enjoy the Quidditch games so much! His commentary is just funny and brilliant!9.)”If I get caught before I can get to the Stone, well, I’ll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there. It’s only dying a bit later than I would have done, because I’m never going over to the Dark Side!”I LOVE HARRY’S DEFIANCE!!! That’s one of the many things that made me like him so much! He never backs down and always continues to fight. No matter the odds, he’s facing his troubles holding his head high! Even this early in the series you can already see that he’s going to be a great MC!And now let’s move on and read book two! ;-)'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""We don't support transphobes in this house""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""On my list ofreasonswhymy daughtersare thebestest thingto ever happen to me,Number 14,577is that they gave me, at41 years old, the perfectexcuseto revisit theHarry Potterseries.When my oldest angel told me she wanted to start reading the Harry Potter books, I couldn’t have been happier. As I was collecting all seven volumes off the shelf to bring up to her room, I started feeling nostalgic for the whole Hogwarts gang, and I realized that I’d never done more than a perfunctory review of this first volume. I figured it was high time to rectify that oversight.Harry deserves it.However, with over a million ratings, and almost two reviews for every day I’ve been alive, I think I can dispense with any plot distillation or character profiles. It has all been eloquently said before. Therefore, I just want to briefly express what I see as the essential magic at the heart of the series, and why I think it has resonated so strongly with so many people.Here goes...Only rarely does a story come along that can so completely wrap you up in a warm blanket of contentment and good feelings. One that can hold at bay, even if only for precious moments, the nasty brutishness of what often passes for daily life. These stories do that.It’s an escape into a world of optimism, honor, and hope, where things always look hopeful and anything is possible. Who wouldn't want to hang around in a place like that, especially when it is decorated with sorting hats, kindly giants, magic wands and Quidditch.Granted...no aspect of the story is revolutionary, or even particularly noteworthy, from the standpoint of blazing new trails within the fantasy genre. It isn’t great literature, and nothing about its technical merits makes it befitting of even a fraction of its unprecedented success.Fine...acknowledged. And? So what!The virtue of this story is the postive feelings it conjures in its readers. Harry’s story is something that radiates acceptance, inclusion, and friendship. It invokes a sense of belonging. Inside these pages, you can find the impetus to see the better angels of humanity’s nature, and feel just a little better about the world around you.How is that not worthy of praise?As for Harry himself, he’s just a good kid. The quintessential everyman who makes good. A loving boy with a clear head on his shoulders and a caring heart that pumps affection for the world around him. He’s someone you can’t help but like.He’s not perfect. He makes mistakes, he’s occasionally short sighted, and I know many of us wish he would stick up for himself a little more. Maybe reduce his aunt and uncle to a pair of fatty stains on the carpet, or give Dudley an atomic wedgie until his skivvies scrape against his pancreas.But that’s not Harry. He’s a better person than that. That’s why we love him.Maybe all of the above is a bit much. Like I said, I was feeling nostalgic and maybe the gush got a tad away from me. Let’s just say that these stories are perfect comfort food and reading them will make you happy.I’ll certainly settle for that.As for the rating, I Initially only gave this first volume 3 stars, and I’m not going to change that now. As much as I love the series as a whole, I don’t think it reaches stratospheric heights untilHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.Still, this is where it all began. As such, it should be read and savored knowing that it only gets better.3.0 stars. Highly Recommended.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""As wonderful and magical as promised. Because I didn't remember the movie, the third act of the book was a delightful surprise to me.I wish I'd had this book when I was a kid, because the idea that someone could be special without knowing it, and then get to visit a special world where the things that made him different were the same things that made him awesome would have been really inspiring to me.Anne's finishing this, too, and I have to wait for her before I start in on the second book ...

They read all the books when they were young and watched all the films. They would re-watch and re-read them. They would fall in love with the Wizarding World and would completely adore Harry, Ron, and Hermione. They would talk about them non stop, about Hogwarts, about its teachings, about them wanting to become students there and pretending they are, about joining the HP fandom, about loving every character and instantly missing the world. Everyone would adore Harry Potter and knew about it since they were young ones.Except me.I didn\'t grow up with Harry Potter. Not because I didn\'t get to, but because I chose not to. I know, it\'s like living a life where everything has been a lie. Worse even. It\'s just, the movies would appear on my tv. From the first one, to the next and the next, and every time I saw the trailer for the upcoming one, I wouldn\'t be interested and would skip it when I came to it. I wouldn\'t bother and wouldn\'t care, and that made a big problem in my life now. Here I am now, being left out because of such poor choices and decisions I made when I was 7, 8, 9, and older until now. But now, as 2016 and having over 500 friends that are caught up and have read the recently published novel,Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,I have finally read the first book and am able to continue the series and watch the films. Now, here I am, wishing to go back to my past and change this nightmare and actually watch the films or read the books because I have literally missed on so much, missed too much, and have been missing too much. I have been out of this world and never realized how good it is, and how special it already has become.There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak to seek it.Harry Potteris one of the most famous, loved, and top series out there. It is loved, adored, cherished, and amazing for HP fans every time they read it. No matter how many times it is read, it fills the person\'s heart with warmth and happiness, as they are going back to the wizarding world. As for me, I have finally entered it and feel young and new and early to this, because I am new to this all.Other than that, Harry Potter is considered a Children\'s book but in my opinion, it\'s in between middle grade and young adult because it can be hard to read for some. Although it was very very easy for me to read and understand, I see myself reading this all these years before and having a lot of trouble pronouncing some names.Harry Potter, a story about a young wizard that didn\'t even know he was a wizard. Harry Potter, a 10 year-old boy, who turned 11, is living with his horrible, rude and awful ""family"", The Dursleys. Mrs. Dursley is known as Harry Potter\'s mother\'s sister. The problem is, they didn\'t like each other, nor blend in with each other. They were different. Her sister was a witch, while she was just a Muggle, a person who cannot seek the magic and find it, nothing and no one special because they aren\'t able to turn things into other things, aren\'t able to fly on a broom, cast a robe on fire, defeat a villain, confuse a troll, aren\'t able to do anything, really.The reason for Harry living with this family and having to go trough all this trouble and mess is because he was actually given to them by Professor Albus Dumbledore, known as one of the greatest wizards and the headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. When Harry was a baby, his parents were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who but as he tried killing Harry, he really wasn\'t able to. His mother was killed because she was trying to stop him, but as he tried killing Harry, he couldn\'t bare to do it and left him a scar, the scar that has made Harry known and popular for surviving this evil person. Once saved and taken, the only people they can rely on are The Dursleys, and as Harry grows, they expect them to tell him he is a wizard and tell him everything and fix all the lies. Except they don\'t.As days pass, Harry has been getting letters from someone he doesn\'t know. He doesn\'t know who it is and what they want, but he knows there is something going on, due to the amount of letters being sent. After getting the chance to open the first one, his Uncle Vernon decides to snatch it away from him, read it, and burn it. He knows, he knows who it is and what they want, but he doesn\'t want Harry to know. But even with him burning letter by letter and collecting them all, letters keep arriving and arriving, until the person finally shows up face-to-face with The Dursleys and Harry on his 11th birthday.He\'s huge, introduced as a half-giant and half-human, known as Rubeus Hagrid. Hagrid is the one who tells Harry the truth, telling him he is a wizard, and a well-known one as well. He\'s got talent, and has some of the same abilities as his parents. One being a witch and the other being a wizard, Harry is known as a wizard as well. And as Hagrid tells him the truth, Harry does too.He doesn\'t know what he is talking about and doesn\'t know what is going on.He doesn\'t believe he is a wizard, and doesn\'t believe the reason for his parent\'s deaths. But of course, Hagrid decides to tell him the truth and tell him his parents did not die on a car crash, for that seemed impossible, but they were killed by Everyone-Knows-Who and is the reason for his scar.When Harry leaves with Hagrid, they go and buy him what he needs, including clothes and supplies for the school. As they go to the shop, he is introduced as Harry himself but is instantly known by everyone else. Everyone is pleased to meet him and feel proud because they have shaken his hand. He\'s famous, his name is everywhere, and he can be considered a legend for what happened. But even with all this going on, Harry is still a little confused and figuring things out. As Harry and Hagrid get what they need, it\'s time for Harry to go to school, where he meets Ron Weasley, as to what I know, one of his best friends. Ron is small, red-haired, has freckles, pale, and has two twin brothers going to Hogwarts with him. He\'s not accepted into the other groups, and that is why he blends in with Harry and becomes his friend. Harry also meets Hermione Granger, known as someone annoying and as a nightmare to them both because of how bossy and unrealistic she can be. Of course, they are all so small and Hermione is a little nerd that enjoys every teaching at this school, so I was just like ""we get it.""Days pass, and Harry is being trained. He\'s a neutral to broom-stick flying, is able to play Quidditch, the most popular game in Hogwarts, is given special supplies, and is of course, known by everyone. Other than that, Harry suspects his own secrets and wants to find out truths, but in order to do that, he must find a way to find them and figure them out. With the help of his two friends, he might just be able to figure out the real reason behind him being a wizard, more about his parents, history about himself, who this ""You-Know-Who"" person is, remember his past, and see how his life really will be changed, forever.Humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.Harry Potter was easy to read, understand, and there was no hesitation when it came to rating it 5 stars. Now, I hate myself once again and ask myself, again, ""Why did I not read this earlier?"" The answer is obvious, because I already know it and it\'s because I was never a fan of it. I hate speaking about my past, but this is one ugly past and I hate it. I hate the choice I made and I hate myself for allowing it. But soon I\'ll get over it and will be able to re-read this as many times as I will be able to during my last 3 years of being a teen. Yes, a 15 year-old that has not read Harry Potter simply because she chose not to when she was able to and when she was young.PATHETIC.The fantasy is cute, I will say. It\'s easy to understand and the book is easy to fly through. It\'s not long, it\'s not hard, and it\'s not boring. It\'s gripping, fun, and everything is filled with some kind of magical element that has me turning page by page. Having no regrets anywhere, I am finally able to talk about HP and the world of wizards, where students learn how to make potions, talk to ghosts, learn about other creatures, transform things into other things, read minds, become invisible, fly in the air with a broomstick, play soccer in the air, have a feast and enjoy it all, learn magic, have a wand, and just be filled with happiness because of the friends and families considered in the houses. Well, I guess in most.Everything was fun to read. I laughed at some parts and found the story to be more affective to me as Harry was figuring out his new and changed life. He was confused, but he found out a lot more. There\'s still more, but I know that as he grows, I will be able to follow along the late ass journey and see where he grows to and how. I\'ll see how strong he gets and find out some strengths and weakness\'. I\'ll be able to join an invisible magic carpet and fly through the series because I just want to know what happens next and how everything goes. I want to see Harry become a better person and be able to prove Draco and his stupid friends wrong about what they think. I want his friendship with Ron to grow and become stronger. I want Hermione to stop being so talkative and take a little break of being so bossy. But more importantly, I want to have a fun journey reading this and feeling like I\'m on an adventure. Reading it for the first time feels like one. I\'ve never watched the films. I\'ve watched parts, but skipped them. Now, I won\'t skip anything. It\'s like an adventure where I\'m dived in and can\'t seem to leave because I\'m so alive and intrigued.What can I say about Harry Potter that others have not said? Nothing. Reviews are always similar, and this one might be too. Everyone loves it, and so did I. Yes, I rolled my eyes at times because there were moments where I was annoyed. But nothing was boring, and even when I rolled my eyes, there was a reason for that eye rolling scene. Maybe it was Hermione being annoying, or Draco being a rude boy, mocking an adorable red-haired. Or both. But I was also laughing. I would always laugh when it came to Hagrid. Since the beginning, I instantly loved him and considered him hilarious. I love how he turned Dunley into a pig but failed because he was already too much of a pig. I remember laughing and noticing my parents looked at me weirdly, but that\'s okay because I needed a novel where I was happy and ended up laughing at times. Oh and also, Hagrid is honestly so nice and adorable guys, I love him. He\'s so funny and protective and is such a good friend to Harry. I loved everything he did for him and was glad he was the first one to introduce himself to Harry. He cared for him since he was a baby and saw him as 11, bring him a present and giving him another one at the end.Ron is honestly the cutest. I don\'t understand how anyone could be mean to him. He may be weak, but he has his own strengths. He\'s so adorable and small and I hated how Draco treated him. There were some times unnecessary and I hated Draco for it, but I\'ll probably end up loving Draco some time throughout the series and probably regret it because I know he\'s still gonna be really mean throughout the series. I\'m sure. I haven\'t spoiled myself, so I have no idea how his or anyone else\'s life goes, but I do know that he changes in some way. Hermione is a small and cute nerd as well, but sometimes I hated how sassy she was and bossy. She hated losing points for her house and because she, Ron, and Harry were in the same house, they had to work together and find a way to become friends to find out other truths and earn points for Gryffindor. She took everything very serious and showed off at times because of her perfect test grades and assignments, but I was glad she was able to put up with Ron and Harry while they put up with her.The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione was probably one of my favorites. I know it didn\'t work out at first and they honestly hated her, but I was so happy it literally had to work toward the middle. Thanks to the troll, she became their friend and actually was able to cooperate with them. She didn\'t yell at them for fighting the troll, but instead told them to be careful and send word if anything goes wrong when Harry went for the mirror again. As it was ending, she was saying goodbye to Harry and Ron and was even awkward because she couldn\'t really figure out what to say. But also, my heart was really happy when she hugged Harry because it felt real and it felt like something I had been waiting since the beginning. It was friendship goals as they were becoming friends, and it just made me happy seeing them all together, same house, same team, same classes.The writing of course is, like I said, easy to understand. There were no words that were confusing in any way or words that got me mixed up because of how similar they sounded, and there were no problems. I didn\'t know what was gonna happen next and I know books are always better than movies, but I will watch the films after or after finishing one book just to see the differences. I hear they are kind of the same, just that the book provides some more information and detail. Like always, it\'s no surprise.There are some things you can\'t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.Overall, I am so proud of myself for getting the first book over with, now wanting the 2nd and the 3rd and the rest. Really excited to see where this all goes to, and how Harry becomes a better wizard.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""How can more than half of my Goodreads friends be wrong with this?I have to get this right. As of this writing, I have98Goodreads friends.61 (62%)of them have read J. K. Rowling'sHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Out of those who read this,39 (64%)rated this with 5 stars.11of them with 4 stars. All the others gave 3 or 2. Only 2 rated this with 1 star. One of them admitted not being able to finish it.She should not have rated it really since she did not read its entirety. (But she is my friend and it is her right, so why question?)When the book came out in 1998, I was not yet a bookworm so I brushed this aside. I read only those books that my brother told me to read. He was the bookworm but he would not be caught reading any book being pushed by media hype. However, when Warner Bros. released the film adaptation in 2001, my daughter was 6 years old and I thought that, since there was too much hype, the movie must be good and we would have a memorable time with our first ever father-daughter movie date. I was wrong. She not only got scared because of the darkness inside the movie house but she trembled with fear during the life-size human chess game, in that scene when Ron was sacrificed. We left the movie in that scene with my daughter crying and me cursing it:I will never read Harry Potter.My daughter is now 15 going 16. She is not fond of movies and she still does not show interest on reading Harry Potter. However, I am now a bookworm and the other week, I was with my 4 Goodreads friends and 3 of them raved (two of them, again) about Harry Potter books. Oh well, first-time fathers can make mistakes about first movie date with their daughters, Book 1 is included in 500 Must Read Books and the book must be a quick read. So the following day, I bought my copy.After 13 years of the book's existence and me ignoring it, did I finally make a good decision of reading it? Are all of those 39 friends of mine in Goodreads wrong in giving this 5 stars? Most of them did not bother writing a review. Maybe those would be too long or maybe they read this when they were not in Goodreads yet. But I am in Goodreads already so I can make this review long.These are what some of them say:it was a great booki enjoyed reading itFor an eloquent reviewer, she must have been too happy to express herself.Such a great story and creative way of writing. I love Harry Potter.Yes, I agree about the story being great and J. K. Rowling being creative.I was secretly wishing I was studying in Hogwarts too! It was silly, but I was simply enraptured by Harry Potter. Honestly, I still am :) It was a great book. I enjoyed reading itComing from one of my favorite reviewers in Goodreads. I do not share her wanting to be a sorcerer though.Honestly, I don't know anybody who'd refuse to even entertain the thought of attending a school for wizards.Another one of my favorite reviewers. That seems to have nailed this. Young people wanting to be in Hogwarts and study sorcery. That should be it! The world seems to be a dreadful place that we would all like to have powers to turn our enemies into frogs, pigs, ride on a broomstick and get the Snitch and earn points (money) for our family!Oh well, the Bible says that sorcery is Satan's work. The book even used the word Transfiguration as a subject in the sorcery school. Blasphemy.Just kidding. This is a work of fiction and I am not too old to appreciate it. I was just kidding. To be frank, I tried hard not to like this. I thought that giving this a 1 or 2 will freak out my friends and somehow get votes from those who are, up to now, ignoring this book.I told you so! Why waste your time?. However, unless you are a grumpy old man/woman, there is nothing not to like about this book. I maybe too old for it but hey, talent is talent and J. K.

La portalettere
",Francesca Giannone,4.12,7396,2961,"Fiction, Italian Literature, Historical Fiction, Historical, Audiobook, Historical Romance, Italy",416,06-01-2023,"Salento, giugno 1934. A Lizzanello, un paesino di poche migliaia di anime, una corriera si ferma nella piazza principale. Ne scende una coppia: lui, Carlo, è un figlio del Sud, ed è felice di essere tornato a casa; lei, Anna, sua moglie, è bella come una statua greca, ma triste e preoccupata: quale vita la attende in quella terra sconosciuta?Persino a trent’anni da quel giorno, Anna rimarrà per tutti «la forestiera», quella venuta dal Nord, quella diversa, che non va in chiesa, che dice sempre quello che pensa. E Anna, fiera e spigolosa, non si piegherà mai alle leggi non scritte che imprigionano le donne del Sud. Ci riuscirà anche grazie all’amore che la lega al marito, un amore la cui forza sarà dolorosamente chiara al fratello maggiore di Carlo, Antonio, che si è innamorato di Anna nell’istante in cui l’ha vista.Poi, nel 1935, Anna fa qualcosa di davvero rivoluzionario: si presenta a un concorso delle Poste, lo vince e diventa la prima portalettere di Lizzanello. La notizia fa storcere il naso alle donne e suscita risatine di scherno negli uomini. «Non durerà», maligna qualcuno.E invece, per oltre vent’anni, Anna diventerà il filo invisibile che unisce gli abitanti del paese. Prima a piedi e poi in bicicletta, consegnerà le lettere dei ragazzi al fronte, le cartoline degli emigranti, le missive degli amanti segreti. Senza volerlo – ma soprattutto senza che il paese lo voglia – la portalettere cambierà molte cose, a Lizzanello.Quella di Anna è la storia di una donna che ha voluto vivere la propria vita senza condizionamenti, ma è anche la storia della famiglia Greco e di Lizzanello, dagli anni ’30 fino agli anni ’50, passando per una guerra mondiale e per le istanze femministe.Ed è la storia di due fratelli inseparabili, destinati ad amare la stessa donna.","[{'rating': 5, 'content': 'Questa non è solamente la storia di Anna la portalettere, è anche la storia di Anna che ama sorseggiare la colazione tiepida sulla panchina del giardino prima dell’inizio della giornata, è la storia di Anna venuta dalla Liguria a Lizzanetto per amore di suo marito, è la storia di Anna, donna moderna, controcorrente e determinata a diventare la prima portalettere del paese, è la storia di Anna che si impegna per gli altri, per le donne ma, soprattutto, per la libertà personale di tutti quelli che incrociano la sua strada.Non è però abbastanza, perche questa è anche la storia di Carlo e del progetto vinicolo, di Antonio e dei suoi libri sottolineati, di Agata e del pasticcio di carne che soffoca lo sdegno e l’insoddisfazione, di Giovanna e della sua rinascita, di Daniele e del suo sogno stilistico, di Carmela e dell’abbandono mai perdonato, di Lorenza e delle sue fragilità. È la storia di un’epoca, di persone, gesti, parole e tradizioni che si incontrano e scontrano con l’anticonformismo di una donna che sa essere tutto senza giudicare niente, coerente fino alla fine, ritta e determinata in ogni sfumatura della sua vita.La storia che Francesca Giannone scrive in queste pagine, e che trae ispirazione dalla storia della bisnonna, è una storia personale e familiare lunga quasi trent’anni, dal 1934 al 1961, un concentrato di personaggi ed eventi che avvolgono il lettore tra gesti e tradizioni, sentimenti, scelte e segreti che incrociano sempre la strada di Anna, protagonista travolgente dalle tantissime sfumature, donna moderna e visionaria, che mai si abbassa alle controverse ingiustizie di un paese arcaico e omertoso, incatenato a usi e giudizi morali insensati, che combatte per se stessa e per gli altri, che dona amore e rinuncia anche ad esso per la propria integrità.Una protagonista che basterebbe a descrivere la pienezza di queste pagine, il fulcro di un romanzo che vive anche accompagnato da tanto altro, dai luoghi, dai co-protagonisti, dal tempo e dalle decisioni, a volte dolciamare che sottolineano le diversità intime di ognuno dei personaggi dando voce alle diversità interiori dell’animo umano e alle conseguenze di ogni scelta.Una storia ben scritta, ben raccontata e coinvolgente da cui si emerge a fine lettura con un po’ di tristezza e commozione, consapevoli però di aver letto un piacevole, piacevolissimo romanzo con una protagonista davvero unica!'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Come al solito mi lascio sempre trascinare dalla definizione saga familiare, magari ambientata in un periodo storico non prossimo al nostro. In aggiunta qui c\'è di mezzo una terra che è nel mio cuore, che porta con se l\'accento croccante e le terre rosse e assolate: lu sule, lu mare e lu ientu. E così mi son detta: “ma si, diamo un’altra possibilità alla casa Editrice Nord” anche se le ultime proposte non sono state entusiasmanti. La stroia di una donna ligure che segue l marito salentino emigrate al nord e che decide di tornare nella terra natale a metà degli anni trenta. Lei decide di fare la portalettere, mestiere considerato maschile, e il racconto della vita di una manciata di famiglie legate tra loro da legami più o meno di sangue nei successive trenta anni circa.Detto in modo esplicito, questo libro non mi è piaciuto. I motivi sono talmente tanti che risultano anche difficili da elencare.Ambientazione. Se vi aspettate descrizioni corpose e cariche di colori e profumi, propri di questa terra, scordateveli. Nemmeno una descrizione di Lecce, ma di che è gialla se proprio non sai come descriverla. No, è solo un nome messo li quasi per caso. Avrebbe potuto ambientarlo anche in un\'altra parte d\'Italia, anche in paese inventato, non cambiava assolutamente nulla. Non sono riuscita a trovare nulla dei paesani del Salento.Accuratezza e la profondità dei riferimenti storici. Saltare a piè pari la guerra è molto furbo perchè non aveva gran cose da dire ma porca miseria, vuoi rendere cosa significava stare in una città di provincia lontana dalla linea del fuoco, dalle grandi ed epiche battaglie, dove le persone che sono andate in Guerra e sono state sottratte al lavoro nei campi hanno creato turbamento e hanno generato le più ingenti perdite? Credo sia da citare la scena della radio di “fine aprile \'45”, con i tedeschi che si arrendono e ""la guerra è finita"". I tedeschi hanno firmato a inizio Maggio, le informazioni sembrano buttate li senza una vera investigazione e approfondimento. Un’altra scena: le donne tronfie che vanno a votare per la prima volta, la protagonista che vota ""Repubblica"", pochi discorsi lontani sul verosignificato di quel voto. Il reale sentiment del sud Italia tutto era completamente diverso. Va bene vuoi fare la protagonista appassionata repubblicana ma descrivi il contest attorno in cui si muove. Per sfizio sono andata a vedermi i risultati del referendum a Lizzanello e devo dire che sorprendentemente per la repubblica hanno votato ben il 19% , tutto sommato una percentuale alta consideranto il sentimento del sud Italia tutto in quel periodo. E\' stato descritto questo? Assolutamente no!Per non parlare delle attività familiari. Allora, mettimao bene in chiaro che non si capisce se questi sono benestanti, arricchiti, un pò e un pò. I mesteieri vengono assegnati un pò a caso, e anche gli accessori. Carlo, il marito de la portalettere già dal\'35 va in giro con la macchina di proprietà, quindi ricco però al contempo in casa fanno tutto da soli, sneza nemmeno una donna di servizio. Proprio moderni al massimo. E così anche per le altre famiglie citate nella trama. Ho avuto l\'impressione che siano state prese azioni, atteggiamenti e abitudini del giorno d\'oggi (o di pochi decenni fa) e trasferiti prima della guerra. Per non parlare delle attività di famiglia, la cantina mi sembra assurda, c’è un potenziale enorme e niente l’importante è la scritta da riverniciare.E poi c\'è lei, la nostra protagonista. Che dire, arriva dal nord e non riesce a capire questi zotici, impedisce al figlio di imparare la parlata locale ma trova naturale infarcire le sue frasi di francese. E già li snobismo a palla, travestito da trasgressione. E poi è di una piattezza incredibile, è arrivata con quella testa, quelle abitudini e quelle idee e non ha avuto nessunissima evoluzione nel tempo. Lei è superiore a qualsiasi cosa, è una femminista convinta ma non come le suffraggette a cui sarebbe più vicina temporalmente no, alle femministe degli anni settanta. E\'una che capisce di tutto dalla dislessia all\'autolesionismo, vuole essere indipendente e il suo modo per affermarsi è facendo la postina. Sembra quasi un capriccio per mostrarsi diversa dagli altri più che una reale esigenza.Accusa gli altri di non sapersi imporre e poi nelle uniche scelte che la farebbero alzare sopra la mediocrità si allinea agli usi e convenzioni imposti. Continua a stare col marito per abitudine (forse, non si capisce) e lo asseconda nell\'avventura politica con la DC. Oh ma dov\'è andata tutta la trasgressione. Preferisce stuszzicare gli altri, ad esempio la nipote Lorenza (che personaggio anche lei) a trasgredire i dettami della morale comune ma lei resta sempre nel binario del lecito.Tra gli altri personaggi c’è Daniele Carlà, aiutante del marito della portalettere in cantina ma segretamente appassionato di cucito e di moda. Bene, passione da tenere segreta perchè non adatta ad un uomo secondo l’acida madre. E poi? Come si evolve, quali sono I suoi sentimenti. Boh, scappa, basta. Non si sa nulla.Tutti gli altri personaggi sono cristallizati nelle loro posizioni quasi fossero delle figurine bisimensionali di cartone che si muovono su uno sfondo altrettanto bidimensionale.Il rapporto tra Anna la portalettere e il cognato Antonio: la furbata della passione per I libri, buttare li titoli del periodo per condividere le letture. E poi il nulla. Quali sono i reali sentimenti dell’uno (forse si intuiscono di più) o dell’altra (soprattutto) non è dato saperli. Un colpo al cerchio e uno alla botte si direbbe.Staticità è il giusto nome da dare a questo romanzo. Un potenziale enorme. Una portalettera che può toccare le vite di tante persone e invece resta in superficie, visite fugaci, vite solo sfiorate.Un libro che non consiglio e che sicuramente non resterà perchè i protagonisti, gli ambienti e le storie sono piatte, sbiadite e statiche.Do una stella altrimenti non fa media in Goodreads.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Un libro che non mi ha colpita in nessun modo e l'unico pregio che ha è quello di essere scorrevole e scritto bene, non annoiando mai il lettore.A livello di trama non è sicuramente la scoperta del secolo, visto che si tratta a tutti gli effetti di un romanzo familiare ambientato nell'Italia degli anni '30. Giannone racconta le vicende della famiglia Greco, soffermandosi di più sulla protagonista, Anna.Il primo difetto che ho notato durante la lettura è il fatto che tutti i personaggi rimangano statici nel corso del romanzo, senza un'evoluzione o una messa in discussione delle loro idee. Anna è la tipica rappresentazione della donna femminista di quegli anni: sostiene la libertà di voto per le donne, intraprende un lavoro prettamente maschile, subendo le critiche da parte degli altri paesani. Quello che emerge a fine lettura non è una narrazione veritiera o quantomeno verosimile, ma anzi diventa il frutto di un'accozzaglia di persone irrealistiche, sempre così fissate sulle loro idee da non poter valutare quelle degli altri, rimanendo macchiette indistinte e inutili, sviscerate da qualsiasi messaggio importante. Gli unici personaggi che probabilmente mostrano un vero cambiamento sono Giovanna e Carmine, ma rimangono totalmente irrilevanti ai fini della trama.Anna è sicuramente il personaggio raccontato meglio, ma anche lei soffre di alcune lacune a livello di trama. A volte ci dimentichiamo che la protagonista è ligure (se non per qualche riferimento randomico al pesto che prepara incessantemente), proprio perchè sembra che la sua esistenza sia iniziata solo dopo il trasferimento a Lecce.Non sarebbe stato meglio raccontare anche della vita ligure di Anna, per renderla un personaggio verosimile e conferirle una certa profondità, che sicuramente le manca?La parte più importante e interessante del libro, ovvero la trattazione storica, è forse quella riuscita peggio. Ogni tanto ci sono dei riferimenti a fatti storici rilevanti, ma in realtà la storia potrebbe essere tranquillamente ambientata ai giorni nostri. A questo punto credo proprio che l'intento dell'autrice fosse quello di raccontare dinamiche familiari inedite, ma in realtà viste e riviste, senza approfondire e indagare molto il contesto storico e sociale attorno ai personaggi.Anche la chiusa non mi ha convinto: dal litigio tra Anna e Antonio (che tira fuori la questione della prima figlia di Anna, trattata nelle prime 80 pagine e mai più riemersa), alla fuga di Lorenza e la questione incesto mai risolta...Un romanzo con delle lacune pesanti, ma che nel complesso si fa leggere e risulta anche piacevole.Se volete leggere qualcosa di simile, ma migliore a livello qualitativo, consiglio caldamenteL'ottava vita, dalla trattazione storica eccezionale!""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Um romance morno, como o leite que a protagonista gostava de tomar no seujardin secret, isto quando não estava a fazerpesto, a entregar cartas ou a ler.

Inoltre, è anche finalista del Premio Alassio Centolibri, un Autore per l'Europa 2023.La storia è ambientata a Lizzanello, in provincia di Lecce, e abbraccia l’arco temporale che va dal 1934 al 1962.Lizzanello è il paese d’origine della scrittrice. La protagonista è Anna, la donna che viene dal Nord, sposata a Carlo Greco, che per i paesani sarà e resterà sempre la foresteria.“Carmela scosse la testa. «Vedi? È da queste cose che si capisce che sei e rimarrai sempre una forestiera.»«Perché, cosa ho detto?» si accigliò Anna.Carmela le puntò gli occhi dritti nei suoi. «Da queste parti, quando uno di noi sta male, nessuno si sognerebbe di farlo pagare, o di far pagare la sua famiglia, per i servizi», rispose, dura.«Torna fra cinque giorni, e li troverai pronti», aggiunse prima di congedarla.”Anna lentamente stravolgerà molte cose a Lizzanello.

GiannoneHo letto questo libro perché mi è stato consigliato e prestato, ed ero molto curiosa di leggerlo: ne ho sentito parlare parecchio, ha vinto dei premi importanti, la sinossi sembrava intrigante.Ok, avevo aspettative troppo alte; gli riconosco come unico merito la scorrevolezza: si fa leggere velocemente.Per il resto, l\'ho trovato inconsistente, poco approfondito, con troppi argomenti ben spendibili ma rimasti solo accennati e che strizza l\'occhio all\'attuale ondata di femminismo, ma non ha assolutamente nulla di femminista.Andiamo con ordine.L\'incipit è buono, ma perderà consistenza anch\'esso con la fine del romanzo (provate a rileggerlo dopo aver finito il romanzo, se non ve lo ricordate, e trovate un senso alla scena tra Giovanna e Roberto, ad esempio).Manca totalmente l\'ambientazione: non ci sono vere descrizioni dei luoghi, è ambientato in Salento, ma potrebbe essere in qualsiasi altro luogo, non c\'è legame tra i personaggi e la loro terra d\'origine a parte l\'accenno al Grande Leccio, ai muretti e pochissimo altro.Quando parla di cibo, capisci che questi poveri protagonisti vivono di pasticcio di carne (per la parte meridionale) e di trofie al pesto (ok, la protagonista è ligure, ma non è che passa la vita a fare il pesto...).L\'ambientazione storica è inesistente, qualche accenno buttato qua e là, senza approfondimento, e poi non posso perdonare di aver completamente saltato gli anni della seconda guerra mondiale. Ho provato imbarazzo e controllato che non mancassero pagine al libro. È molto furbo, se non c\'è vera ambientazione storica: ti metti al riparo da possibili strafalcioni se non hai voglia di fare ricerca, però quello era il giro di boa del romanzo. Doveva essere il momento in cui le persone mostrano la loro vera faccia.Poteva essere il momento in cui la protagonista, diventata portalettere un po\' per caso, un po\' per sfida, capiva l\'importanza del suo lavoro, nel portare lettere dal fronte alle famiglie o cose simili, ad esempio, e invece nulla.La famiglia Greco attraversa la guerra senza intoppi, senza problemi, restando a casa e avendo sempre a disposizione cibo e dentifricio (!).Non si capisce neanche bene perché gli uomini della famiglia Greco siano gli UNICI a non essere partiti per la guerra. Resterà un mistero.La situazione economica della famiglia non è ben precisata, si accenna di una eredità, la cui consistenza non è chiara, ma vagamente descritta come ""sufficiente a stare tranquilli per un po\' "".Considerato che ci vorranno quattro anni per riuscire a imbottigliare il primo vino della neonata cantina e che non è che diventi ricco con la prima bottiglia, l\'eredità doveva essere decisamente consistente.Piove tutto dal cielo, per questa famiglia: questo zio ha lasciato ai nipoti soldi, terre... l\'oleificio di Antonio parrebbe essere ben avviato da tempo. Chissà...I protagonisti restano fondamentalmente statici, non hanno nessun percorso di crescita, maturazione, cambiamento: sono fatti con lo stampino, qualsiasi cosa succeda non si evolvono mai.Possiamo dire che Anna, la protagonista, è antipatica? È praticamente perfetta, quello che fa lei è sempre giusto, non si ""mischia"" mai ai locali, si trasferisce al sud per seguire il marito ma non fa nulla per ambientarsi. Guarda tutti con aria di superiorità. Non c\'è profondità in questo personaggio, quando si arrabbia ""alza il sopracciglio"", guarda gli altri come fossero tutti zotici ignoranti. Sappiamo che in Liguria faceva la maestra, ma perché poi è rimasta portalettere, abbandonando il sogno di tornare a insegnare? Perché lei è così ""moderna""? Che trascorsi ha? Che percorso ha fatto per capire le cose che cerca di far capire alle altre donne? È nata sapiente? Sarebbero bastate anche poche righe a riguardo.L\'amore con Carlo è inconsistente, si sfidano per tutto il romanzo, ogni tanto fanno la ""famiglia cuore"", però quando lui muore lei non supererà mai il lutto per ""l\'amore della sua vita"" e non vedrà più Antonio per ""non correre il rischio di amarlo più di Carlo. Carlo non lo merita"". Sei sicura?Il finale l\'ho trovato pessimo, infatti, buttato lì in poche righe, sbrigativo e deludente.A proposito di femminismo: l\'unità di misura delle donne di questo romanzo è l\'aspetto fisico. Sono belle, o brutte.Anna è bellissima, sempre, comunque, in qualsiasi situazione e non invecchia mai.Carmela è bella e curata, ma cattiva.Agata è sfiorita, volgare, trasandata.Lorenza era una bella bambina, poi un\'adolescente BRUTTA, successivamente una donna affascinante.Non continuo, per il bene del mio fegato.L\'aborto spontaneo di Agata: perché questo avvenimento? Non ha conseguenze sulla trama. Tra l\'altro, in queste pagine si dirà che Agata - circa 35 anni - è ormai troppo VECCHIA per sperare in un\'altra gravidanza. Stendiamo un velo pietoso sulla scena del concepimento (vogliamo davvero leggere il resto del romanzo pensando che Antonio sia una persona meravigliosa?), e diciamoci che Agata non rimarrà più incinta non per l\'età, ma perché non condividerà più il letto con il marito (la cosa più femminista di tutto il romanzo) e non vorrà più avere a che fare con il sesso.In quel frangente, però, Anna si avvicina ad Agata, la aiuta, le sta vicino. Perché non hanno poi legato davvero? Perché Agata non ha avuto un\'evoluzione emotiva? Mi aspettavo anche che chiedesse alla cognata di insegnarle a leggere. Perché Anna ha ripreso ad ignorarla, una volta ripresasi fisicamente e moralmente?Il viaggio di Antonio: anche questo è un episodio senza conseguenze sulla trama. L\'autrice avrebbe potuto parlare del madamato, ad esempio, e invece no. La donna ""locale"" che troverà l\'italico maschio è italiana, giovane, innamorata e sì: sicuramente era vergine. Ma si merita solo poche righe.Mi aspettavo l\'arrivo di un figlio illegittimo nel bel paese (se la donna fosse stata Eritrea, sarebbe stato illegittimo e meticcio, pensa che sviluppo nella trama!), un qualche cambiamento in Antonio... E invece no.Il lavoro di portalettere: mi aspettavo che servisse come espediente narrativo per entrare nelle vite della gente che riceve la corrispondenza. No, è il gancio per inserire i personaggi di Giovanna e Tommaso e per sciorinare l\'indipendenza di Anna (di fatto, non è vero).Mi aspettavo anche che, in qualche modo, la combattiva Anna facesse qualcosa per contrastare o sputtanare Don Giulio che, dopo il salvataggio di Giovanna e la cacciata da casa di Anna e Carlo, sparisce. Salvo poi ricomparire in poche righe, in cui si dice che sta ""aiutando"" un\'altra donna sola. Stronza chi resta, insomma.Però, la combattiva Anna farà la fiera con quel don Luciano, il bigotto. Don Giulio, lo stupratore, lo lasciamo lì.Lorenza: non ho capito se questo personaggio sia stato un maldestro tentativo (assolutamente mal riuscito) di omaggiare Sibilla Aleramo in ""una donna"". Lorenza, per tutto il romanzo, è presentata come una ragazzina capricciosa e viziata. Non c\'è un percorso di crescita, di introspezione, di scelta, come nel libro di Aleramo (sulle cui pagine ho versato lacrime vere). Non commento.Anche gli episodi di autolesionismo li ho trovati poco credibili e solo accennati.Carlo: questo personaggio è il prototipo dello stronzo maschilista, manipolatore, finto progressista. Un uomo cui andrà sempre tutto bene, che ""punisce"" la mancata obbedienza della moglie con un tradimento prima e un temporaneo allontanamento dal letto coniugale poi.Eppure viene presentato come il grande amore. Mi aspettavo anche che Anna scoprisse sia la verità su Daniele che sul tradimento. Insomma, la vera faccia del marito, non la vedrà mai.Antonio: secondo me è persino peggio del fratello, con quel suo darsi un tono da intellettuale per poi prendere a schiaffi colei che per vent\'anni ha ritenuto l\'amore della sua vita, perché colpevole di ingerenza nella vita di sua figlia (un\'adulta che ha fatto la sua libera scelta di vita); insomma, ok l\'amore ma guai a toccare il sangue del sangue del maschio!Non voglio dilungarmi oltre sugli altri personaggi e sulle altre considerazioni che continuano a venirmi in mente, ho già detto abbastanza. Che il libro non mi sia piaciuto mi sembra chiaro e, tanto per tirare le somme, direi che - per me - questo libro è una telenovela che si finge altro, e va preso per quello che è.Ma non lasciatevi ingannare, se ve lo propongono come romanzo storico, o ad argomento femminista, non credeteci.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""“Dai, Anna – disse Carlo ridacchiando – Non è un lavoro da donne.

Estoy preparado para la batalla y para recibirlas de todos los colores, pero allá voy.""La Cartera"", de Francesca Giannone, es un drama familiar de aproximadamente unas 500 páginas. Una novela que se desarrolla durante la primera parte del S.XX. y en la cual nos encontramos con Anna, una mujer del norte de Italia que, junto a su marido y su hijo Roberto, se mudan al sur, a la ciudad donde se crió su marido Carlo. Allí también están el hermano de este (Antonio), su mujer Ágata y su hija Lorenza. Además de a ellos, Anna, que es una mujer progresista y reivindicativa, va a encontrar allí mucha diferencia en costumbres y en evolución social. Desigualdades, injusticias, prejuicios, etc.Hasta ahí bien, eso es lo que más me ha gustado del libro. ¿Entonces? En sí la historia no está mal del todo, pero quizá esté desarrollada muy al detalle, insistiendo muchas veces en cosas iguales o parecidas. Eso me ha provocado la sensación de ser una novela repetitiva, pesada, tediosa o monótona, por ejemplo, no sé sí me entendéis. Por momentos parecía que estaba viendo la típica telenovela de la tarde de TVE1, esas típicas de mujeres con un moño en la cabeza y de casa, con hombres de campo y de bar, representando así a mujeres con roles más pasivos, con muchísimos personajes, con un ritmo más bien lento, de mucho diálogo, todo ello muy enfocado en aspectos mucho más melodramáticos, cosas ya muy trilladas y demasiado vistas.A destacar el personaje de Anna, sin duda lo mejor del libro. Una mujer justa, trabajadora y de lucha constante y que, como a nosotros, le gusta leer. Algunos de los libros que lee durante la trama son ""Almas Muertas"", ""Orgullo y Prejuicio"" o ""Cumbres Borrascosas"", todos ellos clásicos de la literatura universal y que Anna utiliza para ayudar a aprender a leer a quién no sabe. Por otro lado, he odiado el personaje de Lorenza, una ""chica"" consentida, manipuladora y repelente.Y no sé qué más os puedo decir, la verdad. Leerla y lo discutimos. Pero reconozco que no es un libro que volvería a leer. He echado de menos, más allá de lo fácil y del amor, algunas cosas importantes de aquella época,: la Italia fascista, junto con la guerra, y lo que comportó en su momento, por ejemplo. Otra vez me vuelve a pasar, la masa, la crítica, las ventas me han jugado una mala pasada. Yo tengo mi gusto bien definido y prefiero algo con menos ruido y más poderoso que cosas ""puestas de moda"", no sé sí me explico. Es un libro bonito para el que sea de historias romanticonas, pero también hay dolor, esperanza e ilusión.𝘾𝙄𝙏𝘼𝙎:"" - La puntualidad es la virtud de los generosos —le respondió él con una sonrisa.""

La protagonista è Anna, una donna apparentemente fredda e distaccata, proveniente dal Nord Italia, così lontano dal caldo e arretrato Sud... difatti per tutta la vita verrà additata come ""la forestiera"" dagli abitanti del paesino di Lizzanello.Malgrado il clima iniziale di spaesamento, Anna si ambienterà ai ritmi e agli usi meridionali, entrando nelle case dei suoi concittadini in veste di postina, invitata per un caffè o incaricata di leggere dagli analfabeti. Sarà proprio in un\'ccasione del genere che Anna farà amicizia con Giovanna, una donna sola e disperata additata da tutti come ""la pazza"".Altri personaggi importanti sono Carmela, una vecchia fiamma di Carlo, il figlio Daniele e il padre Don Ciccio, che Carlo consulterà per aprire un\'attività vinicola.Interessante il rapporto che Anna instaura col cognato Antonio (invaghito di lei), col quale condivide le proprie letture, e tramite il consiglio e lo scambio di libri, i due comunicano segretamente per molti anni.Anna è una protagonista ben costruita, con pregi e difetti, riesce a conquistare il lettore, e attorno a lei gravitano le vite di tutti gli altri personaggi, che insieme contribuiscono a tratteggiare uno spaccato storico preciso: dagli anni del fascismo, il secondo dopoguerra, fino ai primi movimenti sociali di fine anni \'50 (suffragio universale, sindacati dei lavoratori, emancipazione femminile). La provenienza nordica di Anna è proprio ciò che le ha fornito un\'educazione e una cultura tali da renderla una fautrice del progresso, anche se spesso sarà purtroppo vista come ""il troppo che stroppia"" dagli abitanti di Lizzanello, così tristemente e saldamente aggrappati alle loro tradizioni bigotte e patriarcali.Nonostante ciò, il Sud descritto da Giannone è splendido e pittoresco, come un caldo abbraccio che avvolge e coinvolge il lettore; più volte ho desiderato di sedermi sotto l\'albero di melograno con Anna e avvertire la calda brezza leccese sulla pelle. I contrasti tra Nord e Sud descritti dall\'autrice hanno il pregio di non essere divisivi, bensì aggregativi: danno l\'idea di due mondi che non vanno comparati, ma uniti, per poter formare un tutt\'uno pacifico e completo.Lo stile dell\'autrice è scorrevole e dettagliato, le scene descritte sono come pellicole che rimangono negli occhi anche dopo aver voltato pagina. È sicuramente un libro che mi rimarrà nel cuore, mi sono affezionata troppo ai suoi personaggi per lasciarli andare. In particolare alle donne... Anna, Agata, Carmela, Giovanna e Lorenza sono tutte diverse tra loro, ma accomunate da un dolore tipicamente femminile, causato loro dagli uomini che le circondano. In questo romanzo, la componente storica non risiede solo nel fascismo e nella guerra, ma nell\'avvicendarsi di piccole conquiste quotidiane delle donne, stanche di sottostare alle pratiche maschiliste in atto da troppi secoli. Donne abusate dal compagno, additate dalla società, manipolate dai genitori, discriminate sul lavoro, vittime di violenze fisiche e psicologiche; Anna avrà un ruolo importante per le donne di Lizzanello, anche se queste faranno fatica a riconoscerglielo in un primo momento.

No wiem, prawie robi różnicę 😂 Ale serio, myślę, że wakacje to idealny czas, żeby wczuć się w klimat małego włoskiego miasteczka, do którego pewnego dnia przybywają Anna i Carl Greco.Jeśli chodzi o Annę, nie łatwo ją polubić. Na początku wydaje się bardzo zdystansowana. Widać, że jest zbyt wykształcona i nowoczesna, że nie pasuje do lokalnej społeczności, która jest mocno konserwatywna. Nie chodzi do kościoła, nie plotkuje, walczy o prawa kobiet, a na dodatek rozpoczyna pracę w męskim zawodzie. Dziś kobieta pracująca jako listonoszka nie dziwi. W latach 30-tych wszystko wyglądało jednak inaczej…Czytając „Listonoszkę z Apulii” śledzimy więc losy Anny oraz całej rodziny Greco. Akcja toczy się niespiesznie, co pozwala wczuć się w klimat południa. Bohaterowie nie są idealni. Popełniają błędy.

También nos habla del valor de la familia y la fuerza interior de las personas.La novela narra la historia de Anna, una mujer criada en el norte de Italia, que se traslada a vivir al sur con su marido, chocando su manera de entender la vida con la de sus vecinos. Además de ser una pionera en cuanto a la actividad desempeñada.Así, lo primero que podrá observar el lector es la diferencia de vida y actitud de los habitantes del norte y sur de Italia frente a las mismas situaciones vitales. Se ve claramente en la mentalidad abierta de Anna, la protagonista, ante las creencias desfasadas y machistas de los habitantes de su pueblo sureño. Aquí la autora retrata la mayor cultura y estudios, de forma genérica, del norte a lo que se le une la riqueza económica respecto al sur, donde lo importante era trabajar. Y en el que las mujeres tenían limitado el mercado laboral a muy pocos empleos, ya que el trabajo fuera de casa era considerado esencialmente masculino. Es esta desigualdad y contraste el que Anna ataca con sus actos.Además, y relacionado con el tema anterior, señala la fuerza que poseen las personas para sobreponerse a las adversidades y la falta de confianza de los seres queridos en nosotros para lograrlo.A su vez, es un canto a la amistad y a la ayuda entre amigas para superar algún trauma y vivir la vida con más ánimo y alegría.La novela clama también contra el machismo, como ya se ha indicado anteriormente, y la acción de la sociedad contra la mujer, tanto en aquella época como en esta. Da ejemplos de igualdad en ambos sentidos, tanto desde el punto de vista masculino como femenino.Por otro lado, muestra la fuerza de la prota, la cual que es capaz de sobreponerse a cada obstáculo que se encuentra en su camino.

Não foi escolha minha ler este livro assim, mas agora que o terminei, fez-me muito sentido a forma como o li.Este é o romance de estreia de Francesca Giannone e gostei de conhecer a escrita desta autora: mais do que nos é contado, apreciei a forma como nos é contado. Com uma escrita cuidada, a autora usa descrições muito reais dos ambientes da Itália e, recorrendo a elementos tão típicos do cotidiano, leva-nos numa viagem a memórias profundas.Nos anos 30, Anna, uma rapariga culta, decidida e bastante aberta para os tempos em que vive, muda-se para a vila de onde seu marido, Carlo, é originário. Adaptar-se à nova vila, onde prevalecem as ideias patriarcais, não é fácil para ela, uma mulher com uma mente aberta. Além disso, ao regressar às suas origens, Carlo acaba por se conformar com o pensamento comum para evitar que outros expressem um julgamento negativo sobre sua família. O que quer que Anna faça, qualquer que seja a sua opinião, não consegue quebrar o muro do preconceito e é rotulada como ""a estrangeira"". Indiferente às opiniões, Anna torna-se a carteira da vila e, teimosamente, percorre longas distâncias todos os dias para chegar às casas mais distantes e isoladas e ler as poucas linhas recebidas a quem nem sabe decifrá-las. Com o tempo, mais do entregar as cartas aos vizinhos, Anna assume-se como uma figura central no dia a dia de muitos deles. Anna não é apenas um símbolo da emancipação feminina, da luta pela liberdade, mas é um exemplo de força, de determinação e de lealdade. Anna é o exemplo das mulheres que naqueles anos optaram por lutar, cada uma à sua maneira, para poder mudar as coisas.Este livro é, sem dúvida, uma história de família, das relações interpessoais, das lutas internas… Através dos acontecimentos é possível revisitar partes da história da Itália de 1934 a 1961, com um salto inexplicável nos anos de guerra, o que, na minha opinião, empobreceu a narrativa.

Non posso neanche negare di aver provato dei sentimenti, mentre leggevo. Purtroppo, però, quello che ha prevalso su tutto è una certa incazzatura.I personaggi di questo libro non hanno né arte né parte. La protagonista è uno stereotipo vivente, la classica donna del Nord che va a vivere al Sud e porta con sé la modernità (ma davvero?); è poco più di una Mary Sue che non sbaglia un colpo, con un marito carismatico che è tutto una garanzia; la tradisce; - ma la cosa viene fatta passare in sordina -; le mente - ma con l’espediente del fin di bene -; non la supporta minimamente, ma a lei viene chiesto di farlo e lo fa. Il cognato, altro vertice di questo triangolo (mah), è un uomo che coltiva il sogno dell’istruzione e quindi, negli anni ‘30, pur vivendo di agricoltura trova il tempo di leggere letteratura russa e di discutere riguardo a Dovstoevskij. In questo libro ci sono tanti di quegli accenni filo intellettuali da far venire il vomito: i personaggi che non hanno tale privilegio vengono rilegati a due tipi di ruolo ossia l’antagonista oppure il redento.Tutto corre verso un finale completamente insensato. Giuro, il finale è la cosa che mi ha fatto incazzare di più. Più del salto di tutta la seconda guerra mondiale (manco il tempo di girare pagina pensando: che bello, ora vedrò i personaggi alle prese con un cambiamento radicale); più della storia di Lorenza e Daniele, data proprio ai porci (che poi, qualcuno mi spiega quel mezzo finale aperto delle cartoline da New York con le firme di lei da sola? Lui che è andato dall’altra parte del mondo, lei che è fondamentalmente una stalker malata e tutto si riduce a un mucchio di punti esclamativi. Ok.); più del presunto amore, mai veramente costruito ma fatto solo di sottolineature, tra Anna e Antonio (boh), quello che mi ha mandato fuori di testa è stata la loro lite e la frase;- Lorenza non è Claudia.Che se non avessi la memoria che ho, sarei dovuta andarmi a cercare: Claudia chi? La figlia morta nel sonno a tre anni di Anna, per cui lei porta il lutto nelle prime dieci pagine e che viene nominata forse cinque volte in tutto il romanzo. Ah.Ecco, Giannone apre diecimila archi narrativi, ma non ne conclude decentemente neanche uno. Li spezza, arriva al finale con la fretta di toglierseli di dosso, li lascia aperti all’immaginazione del lettore. Di tutta quella che è la stratificata mole umana, non va mai in profondità.

El choque cultural y social es impactante para ella acostumbrada a trabajar, ser independiente y con unas ideas de vida totalmente diferentes a lo que se encuentra.Cojea y mucho en describir la vida y evolución de la Italia fascista de los primeros años, la guerra y sus consecuencias, el fin de la guerra, la recuperación y se centra en problemas familiares, amores imposibles, una especie de culebrón que se deja leer y entretiene.Los personajes son bastante planos, cada uno con unas características muy acusadas, casi todos resultan desagradables y cuesta empatizar con ellos, bien por acción o por omisión. Unos son engreídos, otros antipáticos y la hipocresía campa a sus anchas en toda la historia.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""Mi sono avvicinata piena di curiosità, spinta dal clamore intorno a questo titolo, ma mi ha delusa profondamente. Un libro senza palpito emotivo, una specie di soap opera piena di luoghi comuni sul meridione, la cui tematica portante sono i tradimenti e i figli illegittimi di un manipolo di personaggi che si perdono in azioni insignificanti, inframezzati ogni tanto da episodi storici o famigliari che sembrano buttati lì ma in cui uno non ha conseguenze per l'altro.L'ambiente del Salento è inesistente se si omettono due riferimenti a muretti a secco e agrumeti. Nessuna descrizione evocativa del paesaggio, nessun profumo o sapore che ci trasporti lì. Non sono riuscita a visualizzare l'ambiente perché semplicemente non c'è: le vicende potrebbero essere ambientate in qualsiasi posto diverso e non cambierebbe una virgola del romanzo. La costa, il mare, la campagna, Lecce, le vie del borgo, dove sono? I profumi e sapori pugliesi si riducono a due citazioni del pasticcio di carne a cui si aggiunge il pesto della protagonista che in 20 anni non cucina altro.L'ambientazione storica è inesistente: che siamo tra gli anni 30 e 50 lo capisci all'intestazione dei capitoli e da accenni a film e libri. Ogni tanto un episodio storico come il voto alle donne, l'occupazione dei latifondi sono buttati lì senza antefatti né ripercussioni. E la guerra non solo è assente ma non tocca il paese. Né prima né dopo né durante nessun accenno a difficoltà economiche, cibo razionato, dolore per i lutti, povertà, cambi di stili di vita. In 20 anni nulla cambia nella vita quotidiana del paese dei cui abitanti non si capisce il tenore. Infine i personaggi. Senza anima, senza evoluzione, statici. Non invecchiano, non migliorano, non cambiano, non sono plasmati dalla storia che procede. Anna poi si erge a migliore di tutti, superiore, algida, saccente, distaccata, salvo poi cadere negli stessi difetti dei paesani che pur definisce zoticoni verso la fine. L'incoerenza massima è nel suo rapporto con Carlo: per tutto il libro lo ignora, lo sfida, non si ritrae davvero alla complicità col cognato, mai un gesto affettuoso per il coniuge. Quando muore improvvisamente invece le crolla il mondo addosso e pare non riesca a superare il lutto. Infine in conclusione le prospettive cambiano ancora senza ragione: rivela in una lettera che in fondo avrebbe amato più Antonio che Carlo: insomma non c'è coerenza. Non c'è emozione.

Troviamo anche il marito, il cognato, la cognata, la nipote, il figlio e tanti altri.È una lettura piacevole, soprattutto nella prima metà del libro, ma non mi è rimasto dentro, è molto raccontato e i sentimenti dei protagonisti non si riescono, secondo me, a cogliere a meno che l'autrice non lo scriva.Il romanzo si basa su una storia vera, dopo che l'autrice ha trovato il biglietto da visita della portalettere Anna, sua bisnonna.Anna è diversa dalle altre donne. Lei sogna di essere al pari di un uomo e non si nasconde dietro il silenzio, ma dice sempre ciò che pensa. Tratta anche i temi della violenza.

È facile affezionarsi ad Anna, ligure in Puglia, femminista in Puglia, comunista durante il fascismo, è facile affezionarsi ad Antonio così delicato e profondo, ma perché non apprezzare anche la voglia di rivalsa di Carmela e Agata, la spensieratezza di Carlo e l'evoluzione di Giovanna?

And when the opportunity to get closer to her arises, he breaks his own rules to offer her a deal she can't refuse.Every monster has their weakness. She's his.His obsession.His addiction.His only exception.***Sweet, shy, and introverted despite her social media fame, Stella Alonso is a romantic who keeps her heart in a cage.Between her two jobs, she has little time or desire for a relationship.But when a threat from her past drives her into the arms―and house―of the most dangerous man she's ever met, she's tempted to let herself feel something for the first time in a long time.Because despite Christian's cold nature, he makes her feel everything when she's with him.Passionate.Protected.Truly wanted.Theirs is a love twisted with secrets and tainted by lies…and when the truths are finally revealed, they could shatter everything.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': '4 💚UPDATE: Stella in fact DID bring this mans to his kneeschristian:no I don’t miss Stellaalso christian:talks to the plants about how he misses her#whipped🐸Starting from the beginning lets talk about the QUEEN 👑ANA HUANGI first saw Twisted Love on tiktok and read the first twisted series book; and as much as I love that grumpy-ass-no-emotions-billionaire I remember thinking that the writing was not one of my favs. Through her entire twisted journey, her books and writing and way with words has only gotten BETTER (which I didnt even think was possible after twisted hate). Twisted Lies has to be one of most well-written books of 2022 where it balances all components of a contemporary romance book: fluff, smut, tropes, story, suspense+++ without jeopardizing the relationship . Nothing about Stella and Christian’s relationship was rushed or fast. and this man tookboy-obsessed to ANOTHER level.👽 There will be spoilers after this point 👽🦎Plot🦎We met Stella in the previous twisted books as the successful social media influencer and Christian harper as the cyber security expert who believes people in love are “insufferable”. Fast forward to book 4, Stella needs to find a way to increase her followers and decides to look for a fake boyfriend. Christian volunteers as tribute. simple?NOPEcause Stella (as we knew from TH) had astalkerand he returned and isALSO obsessedwith her. Christian protects her at all cost but theres also a mole in his security company.And Alex made their wedding florist cry.This book has everything you could ask for without compromising the quality of story iykwim🌱fluffy moments- massages and bubble baths *platonically* 😏🌱christian taking care of Stella after herpanic attack🌱stella becoming a moreconfident powerfulversion of herself - we love an empowered character development🌱christian jetting her off the freakingItalycause she always wanted to go - umm hello THIS IS CALLED STANDARDS🌱stelladefending christianin front of her family - this was in Christian’s pov and mans was touched 🥺🥺🌱christian beingpettyaf - y’all are not ready for this 😂Stella is such a pure soul and Ana does such a book job of describing her thoughts. Stella deals with a lot of “mundane” problems that todays society dismisses by saying “other ppl have it worse” therefore invalidating one’s trauma. From feeling lonely and left out as a kid due to her hight, her family dismissing her career accomplishments as not good enough and leading to her self doubts and insecurities. Not only is it well portrayed but I think thats what will make a lotta people relate to her / understand her.Christian on the other hand is, well… the devil as he calls it. Wouldn’t be much far off I guess. I mean there’s nothing wrong with a morally grey devil who stabbed the hand of the man who groped stella, spilled alcohol on it, then killed him… right 🤗? Ugh the amount of things this man does for stella as if its the most normal thing in the world is entertaining.stellamentioning she needs a watchchristian:buys a 92k watch cause she needed a watchUr just gonna have to read the book for the rest 😝🐍 PETTY Christian 🐍hehhehe hes my favChristian is(not)jealous of a stuffed animal that stella’s followers say would be a better cuddle buddy (on an insta poll)“I glared at the raggedy stuffed animal polluting my living room. I didn’t understand why Stella loved it so much, or why her followers would rather cuddle with it thanme”Christian does(not)care if stella dreams of him or not“I wondered what she was dreaming about and weather said dream included me.If not, that was unacceptable”🥬 The smutt 🥬Ok well to be fair it was pretty well written.

Oh did I mention christian rented the whole ass island and a 70k necklace just to have this moment w her <3“I couldn’t give less fucks about how much the necklace cost. I wanted everyone except Stella gone.”*happy for stella but wallowing in self pity*anyways… christian and his mouth 🤤“Do you like being finger fucked out in the open like a good little slut?”“That’s it, sweetheart. You can take it.”“good girl”🧊 that one scene 💭 🧊“I spread my legs farther, and he pushed the ice inside me at the same time he sucked my clit into my mouth.”🪦 here lies my unmarked grave where I will be bury myself if my parents ever read my reviews… or my tabs.🥦 The stalker 🥦the identity of the stalker was kind of a let down. it would’ve been more exciting if it were someonewe already knew like Brayden the manager or the bell boy guy, but who tf was Julian 😂. And the whole reason for him being dormant for 2 years, his delusions and his endgame was so sloppy. I loved how it was resolved tho. How christian took care of stella after and how christiantook careof the stalker after.I’m honestly not sure what happened with christian being betrayed by one of his men in his company. I feel like there was some big foreshadowing going on there (maybe for Dante’s book) but im not sure I understand how that helped the story but ill come back to it later.My only problem with the book was that when I compared it toTwisted Hate, it felt short. I enjoy reading books with witty banter in their relationship likejoshjuleshad vs the calm and cool approachchristianstellahave. The spice in this book was also less compared to the other twisted books (2 major scenes) TG and TH had a lot more.📗 christian’s morality chain 📗man uses cyber destruction as a tool to make people bankrupt and air out their dirty laundry as a form of relaxation. hemetStella 5 years ago instead of when we thought Jules and stella moved into his building.

You know the type: quiet, kind, always trying to keep the peace—but underneath, she’s a whole powerhouse. All those insecurities and family-pressure vibes? She didn’t let them dim her shine.She faced down a literal stalker (queen behavior), stood up for herself, cared for her nanny like a real one, and took a gamble on her blog even when the odds were shaky. And then she didn’t stop there—she built her own brand. Like, Stella said, ""Fear who?"" She’s not just adorable; she’s inspiring.Her story was the most normal and relatable out of everyone’s, and maybe that’s why it hit so hard. She wasn’t out here solving mysteries or fighting mafia wars; she was just trying to live her best life while keeping it real. Plus, let’s not ignore the fact that she got a man who made her feel like this:❝I don\'t know how to explain it. But he makes me feel like I can be anyone I want to be.❞Girl, I’m thrilled for you (but also, I’m totally not).Jealousy who? MEE!!Now, let’s talk about Christian, because...wow. He actually had layers, which already puts him ahead of a lot of Ana Huang’s other MMCs. Like, Alex? His whole personality was “billionaire flex.” Rhys? Mr. “Good in bed and nothing else.” Josh? Oh, he thought he was funny, but his ego was bigger then his d.Christian, though? Rich? Yep. Grumpy? Of course. Possessive? Duh. But somehow, he didn’t make it annoying. And even with the big ego, he wasn’t unbearable. You want an MMC who’s got humor, a little darkness, and just enough extra? He’smyyour guy.""You taste...like mine.""Sir, we see you pulling a Christian Allister move, but we’ll let it slide because you’re Christian Harper.""If you saw yourself the way other people see you, you\'d never doubt again.""""How do other people see me?""""Like you\'re the most beautiful, most remarkable thing they\'ve ever seen.""Excuse me, who gave you the right to say that and expect me not to fall for you? Rude.The Relationship and Their chemistry? So, so good. Honestly, out of all the couples in this series, theirs felt the most real and well-paced. Nothing rushed, nothing overdone—just two people slowly and believably falling for each other. It was so refreshing to read.""A kiss with her wouldn’t just be a kiss. It would be my fucking end.""Yeah, that’s the kind of drama I signed up for.But Why Not 4 Stars?Okay, so here’s the thing: Ana Huang’s writing is…not great. I didn’t expect much because the earlier books already set that bar pretty low, but she managed to make it worse here. The over-the-top metaphors? The dramatic, cringey inner monologues? I could not.Examples, you ask? Don’t mind if I do:- ""Dark flames devoured all the oxygen in the cabin.""- ""Into the remaining pockets of air in my chest.""- ""Leaving nothing behind except promises of sin and dark pleasures.""- ""Christian was a finely honed assassin’s blade sheathed in velvet, Dante was a hammer burning bright with deadly intent.""Like…girl, what? Who even is Dante? Why are we pretending to know his vibes? And “black ice coating my veins”? Please. The only thing coating my veins is the secondhand embarrassment from reading this.Now let’s get to the plot. Oh my GOD, the plot. What was this nonsense with Christian’s parents and the painting? Like, tell me you’re trying to spice things up without telling me. It was messy, it was random, and it didn’t fit the vibe at all. This could’ve been such a good romance without dragging us into that.As Third Act Drama.. Okay, I’ll give her this—this time, the third-act breakup wasn’t as ridiculous as usual. Ana gets a point for that. But Stella still annoyed me a bit here. Like, Christian has been obsessed with her for FIVE YEARS but didn’t act on it because he didn’t want to be a creep (bare minimum, but still). And the files? That’s public info, babe. Relax.Let’s be real: the man runs a whole security business. Of course, he’s got files on people. You can’t tell me a man that fine, that obsessed with you, does a little light stalking, and your first reaction is to freak out? Ma’am, it’s Christian Harper. I’ll be flattered.So yeah For the first time in the series the reason of the third act breakup wasn’t unrealistic So she get a point.-Rowan: 3-Ana Huang: 1Despite all the messiness, I still loved reading this book. Stella and Christian’s relationship carried the entire series. It was sweet, slow-burny, and just the right kind of dramatic. But the writing and plot?

But by the end— it didnt necessarily win me over, but it did however change my views on the characters… just a bit.Again; I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Ana Huang as a person. Her books have done amazingly well, and are so widely loved— its absolutely amazing, and I’m very happy for her. She seems incredibly sweet— but her writing is just not for me.Now that I’ve completed the twisted series, I know that I will not be reading any more books written by this author. I simply don’t enjoy the way the characters are written, the plots, or writing itself.To make this as clear as possible; I discuss some main issues I had with this book (I actually think I overanalyzed this entirely too much) but that doesn’t mean I’m in any way shaming anyone who enjoyed any of this. I am going to talk about bigger issues that I found in this book— and that does not and should not invalidate your thoughts on it. Good or bad. Taste is always subjective, and I simply didnt enjoy this book.This is both a twisted lies review, AND a series overview. Now that I know everything there is to know… so, be prepared because this is an essay.To start off the twisted lies review, I’m going to talk about Stella.I found Stella so incredibly boring. She didnt have anything that defined her as a character besides existing for Christian’s satisfaction. She had no depth. (This is my complaint with most of the twisted girls, which I will explain soon) but her character was so bland. She had anxiety— so there was that. I found the anxiety topic to be a bit scattered. Like it was mentioned a LOT in the beginning, but then it kinda just faded. So, she had insecurities and anxiety, and she was nice. That’s literally all that I can remember about her entire character. Besides the excessive blushing, butterflies, and getting tuned on because Christian was around her.There were parts of the novel where she became physically aroused because christian sat next to her in a car. In public, she audibly moaned because Christian lightly brushed the side of her neck. She moaned out loud in an art gallery because he stood behind her. There was a scene where she literally got winded— “The memory of my encounter with Christian slammed into me with such force it knocked the breath out of my lungs.” I am gasping for air at the memory of this. All because she remembered the way christian kissed her neck, she acted like she was just kicked in the chest. A direct quote from the book is “I was seconds away from unraveling, and Christian had barley touched me.” Like… are you for real right now. Yes this is fiction, but do you realize how outstandingly over exagerated this is? You’re telling me this girl is on the brink of an ORGASM because he stood behind her and touched her stomach? I’m being so dramatic here but this raises the expectation that women should be easily pleased by the bare minimum. As if this is meant to feel so good she starts writhing on the floor of an art gallery— for what?Again, the fact that this was so far fetched made this laughable and cringe worthy.She danced in the living room and screamed when she realized christian was standing there. She let a spoon fall out of her mouth and let ice cream drip all over her face, and shirt. She called Christian “grumpypants”, and she carried around a stuffed unicorn and only addressed it as “mr. unicorn”. She said things like “movies, ice cream, and internet. What more could a girl want?” She would tell christian everything in the world there was to know about her, then she would pout when he didnt tell her stuff about him. She would get a “heady rush” when she spoke a word to Christian.None of these things make her cute, or give her a personality. She just really irritated me. I feel like I’ve babysat 7 year olds who acted like this.So, the same thing I said for the other twisted women: I don’t have much to say about Stella. Because she really wasn’t a bad character. She was just so poorly written. I didnt enjoy reading about her, I didnt care about her— she had absolutely no structure or real character, whatsoever.The more I read these books, the more I realized how much all the characters lack actual personality, especially the women. Their only personality traits revolve around the men. Which I get into a lot more a little ways down this review.Now to discuss Christian. Christian had a bit more personality, but it just wasn’t good. The amount of times he claims Stella to be “his” was almost as often as Stella blushed. Christian was grumpy and broody— but he wasn’t necessarily icy. Which I actually didnt mind. But in the end— Christian can be summed up to a few words as well; obsessive, sarcastic, possessive, rich, dominant. This book warned me in the beginning that he would be a dominant, alpha hero, so really, its my own fault. But my dislike for this book goes much deeper than the actual tropes itself, its the way it all is written.I did however LOVE that he wrote letters to Stella during their time apart. I love letters in books. They get to me every single time. And I thought christian writing letters to open himself up to Stella was really sweet.Unfortunately, he didnt open up until the end of the book, and of course, there were only 4 or 5 short letters that the reader got to see. But there were 20ish letters in total— so, I’m a little upset there wasn’t more. Especially because those letters were literally the only way to know christian. Because he didnt talk about himself at all for the first 500 pages.To talk about this plot, this “stalker” plot was so boring. It reminded me of the blackmailer plot in twisted hate (which I also hated and found incredibly boring). this book was fairly long for a regular romance— and it actually did the opposite effect that twisted love (book one) did. Unlike twisted love, this main drama plot point went on for too long. It wasn’t the pain plot of the book, so it wasn’t brought up enough to be super interesting or seem important, but it was brought up just enough that I couldn’t wait for it to just be over. I know Christian owns a security company— but why didnt they get the police involved? Now that I think of it… none of the issues in twisted love, twisted hate, and now twisted lies were handled in any normal or proper way. Why didnt Stella contact ANYONE when she first found out she had a stalker? And when he broke into her appartment and Christian couldn’t find the footage of anyone leaving the building— why didn’t they get the cops involved then? These characters just have over the top, unrealistic scenarios that they handle like children.Not to mention the fourth quarter break up (which literally happens in every single one of the twisted books)was because he was so obsessed with her after seeing her five years ago— where they didnt even speak?? That’s terrifying. Her finding binders of information on her in his house, that she was living in? Especially when she’s already so terrified about her stalker. I don’t understand how you can come back from that. I talk a bit about the power imbalance between these characters— and it really shows in this book.Im not even going to get into a discussion about this smut because I know this is an aspect where I’m particularly picky— and where taste ranges a lot. So if you liked this smut, then I’m really glad you did. But I just couldn’t stand it.The full body cringe that I had whenever Stella was stuttering, slobbering, and begging for christian — I couldn’t deal with it. i read the first two smut scenes, but I actually had to skip over the remaining ones because they just made me physically uncomfortable. I hated the degrading kink— him calling her a slut and a whore in bed just doesn’t do it for me. There was nothing desirable about this.The fact that the smut is so similar in every book didn’t make anything better.Alex was very dominant, and Ava was very submissive.Rhys was even more dominant, and Bridget crawled around on the floor.Josh was extremely dominant, and Jules got choked while she begged for it.Christian was dominant, and Stella cried and begged while he called her a slut.Its fine to have a preference, but by the fourth book I was so sick of reading the exact same fucking thing over and over. Would it have hurt to have switched it up, even a little bit? Seriously, I talk about this book being repetitive; but it is literally the exact same as all the others. In every aspect.There were so many small parts of the book that I noticed and just really hated. Like christian telling Stella he doesn’t want any men looking at her, or touching her. And if they do, Christian will kill them. And Christian wants to be able to touch Stella, and if he can’t; then he will die. Those are his exact words. So, I don’t know if that was meant to be attractive or romantic, but honestly— it just sounded like manipulation, possessiveness, and obsession to me.This is just ONE of the MANY small issues there were with this relationship, power dynamic, and book as a whole.The last 12% of the book definitely wasn’t as intolerable as the first 88%, but that unfortunately wasn’t enough to save it for me.However, the ending of this book (the epilogue especially) was cute. Again, since this is the twisted series, it was fairly unrealistic, but it was still sweet. If I liked these characters more, I definitely would’ve loved the epilogue. But it was just… fine.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'this wasgenuinelythe worst book in the series . what a way to end this shit show 😭😭'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': ""2/5Nothing I haven't read before.

I wasn\'t opposed to dating, I just...wasn\'t interested. I liked the idea of it.

But once the book or movie was over and I re-entered the bright light of reality, the yearning disappeared.""i also really admired how selfless and ambitious she was. just because she was passionate about something her family didn’t view highly of didn’t mean she wasn’t successful in her own way, and i’m glad her family eventually came to accept that (as they should 🙄).ᡣ𐭩.ᐟchristiani’m usually not a fan of nonchalant men, but christian’s an exception 🤷🏻\u200d♀️ that said, his violence kinda scared me, and what he did to stella was pretty fucked up (iykyk) 😭 i can’t overlook that, and he dropped from a 9 to a 6 for me 😭 the letters were a sweet gesture though 🥲ᡣ𐭩.ᐟstella and christianstella and christian are definitely my favourites in this series, both individually and as a couple. while i found the plot a bit lacking, their romance made up for it.“There’s something about him… I don’t know how to explain it.

Do you think I would disrupt my schedule and fly to Hawaii in the middle of a work week for anyone else? I thought it was obvious, but in case it isn’t, you’re mine, Stella. I don’t want to see other women, and I sure as fuck don’t want you seeing other men. You belong with me. Exclusively. There is not a world or lifetime where that’s not true.”“I’m onto you, Christian Harper.

I really thought it was going to be a solid 5 stars( I even called it to my sister)Butttt where did it all go?? After that 65% mark it started to get so… flat. My sanity was literally hanging by a thread. I thought okay maybe the stalker will spice stuff up yk?But then ummm… ?? What was that?!*Spoiler*⚠️Christian got just plain boring toward the end. He ended up killing this guy that touched Stella’s ass and goes back to Stella but doesn’t tell her what he did.How is this open love if he’s not shown her every dark facet of his life??Towards the end of the book she says she realises what a bAd BoY Christian is and that he’s capable of BaD tHiNgS *yawn*LIKE COME ON. He should’ve shot a guy in front of her. I’d love to see Huang work through that scene. I feel like she took lots of easy routes to get through the problems.Anyway, I had these theories for who the stalker could be:Theory 1 - the concierge, Lance?Theory 2 - the one guy who commented on Stella’s picture of her in the green dress with Christian’s hand on her thigh, Brycefitness. The guy he was about to crush with a barbell but didn’t??Theory 3 - that one guy she went on a date with???And who does she choose??! SOME RANDO GUY IVE NEVER EVEN HEARD OF!There was supposed to be at least some kind of sprinkling of hints throughout the book right?! Wrong.This was just shoved in our face like BOOM! He’s the guy and you have to accept it. And his backstory was explained so intricately. Like?? Where was all of that in his letters? Why was he not reminding her of the fact that he knew her? The guy did such a poor job at stalking so he gets a big fat F. Oh well, at least he took care of his grandma 🤷🏻\u200d♀️The only redeeming factor was how badass Stella was when she ripped the guys flesh out WITH HER FUCKING TEETH. I read and reread that part so many times because I kept thinking wait did i actually read that right?! THAT made me scream with pride.I will say that even though I wasn’t interested in the whole plot to his rivalry and stuff but that betrayal kind of hurt bc I actually liked Kage. I was genuinely shocked from this more than the stalkers identity which is a damn shame.*Spoilers Finished*That epilogue was so cute though.

She evolved a lot during the book and became a strong and confident woman.“i was getting better at saying no, but I still over-explained myself every time”-Christian:Just like with Stella, I thought I was going to hate him and that he was going to be the boy I liked the least, my favorite is still Josh, but the position of worst romantic interest goes to Alex lol. I liked reading his point of view and that he was really a character with totally gray morality, although it is true that his possessiveness was kind of a turn off for me, and his obsession with Stella was borderline unhealthy.“But like I said, I didn't like people touching what was mine”My problem with this book was the excess of pages and length. It was not necessary. I admit that the book had an incredible slowburn, and until 70% of the book I was happy.But then the whole plot of Stella's stalker was actually boring, the final conflict between them was predictable and already seen in other books and please don't get me started on the smut. I can't, I cringe so hard my teeth hurt lol.About the end of the series in general, it was sweet, seeing the endings of each couple so many years later, andI especially loved Jules and Josh <3.Some quotes that I liked:“the day people stopped thinking they could change someone who didn't want to be changed was the day fewer hearts got broken”“I was used to being alone. Even when I was surrounded by people, apart from me isolated itself until I felt I was watching a movie of my life instead of living it”FELT THIS TOO HARD.And last but not least, the quote that summarizes this book:“The world wasn't black and white, no matter how much I wished it were. And sometimes, we found our happiness in the shades of gray.”previous updates:im starting this so I can finish the twisted series!I didn’t love the previous ones and knowing me I will probably not like this one but here goes nothing 🤓""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'A year ago I would’ve ate this shit up.

",Holly  Jackson,4.2,442695,2935,"Mystery, Thriller, Young Adult, Mystery Thriller, Crime, Fiction, Audiobook",500,05-08-2021,"The finale to A Good Girl's Guide to Murder series. By the end of this mystery series, you'll never think of good girls the same way again...Pip is about to head to college, but she is still haunted by the way her last investigation ended. She’s used to online death threats in the wake of her viral true-crime podcast, but she can’t help noticing an anonymous person who keeps asking her: Who will look for you when you’re the one who disappears?Soon the threats escalate and Pip realizes that someone is following her in real life. When she starts to find connections between her stalker and a local serial killer caught six years ago, she wonders if maybe the wrong man is behind bars.Police refuse to act, so Pip has only one choice: find the suspect herself—or be the next victim. As the deadly game plays out, Pip discovers that everything in her small town is coming full circle... and if she doesn’t find the answers, this time she will be the one who disappears...","[{'rating': 1, 'content': 'Ludicrous. Absolutely fricking ludicrous.I have never been more furious at a book. My hands are shaking in anger right now as I am writing this.Prepare for a hell of a rant.As most people will know, A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder has been my favourite book of all time ever since its release. I am never done recommending it to people and talking praise about it. Jackson’s writing was so well thought out, so thoroughly planned, it was beyond impressive. I related to Pip so much as a character, and found the plot line and writing style absolutely phenomenal.Because of this, it is pretty understandable that I was SUPER hyped for this release. I have had it preordered for two months, had the release date written in all of my calendars and diaries and counted down the days with friends and family.If I had known what I was getting hyped for, I wouldn’t have wasted my time.I’m not sure I have ever hated a book as much.If you love the characters, the ‘whodunnit’ style and overall the first two AGGGTM novels, I must ask that you NEVER DARE pick up or even go remotely near a copy of this book.**MASS SPOILERS Ahead**It began okay. I wasn’t immensely intrigued to begin with, the writing a little repetitive and out of character, but I found it fine as I understand what Pip had been through after Stanley’s death and that she was obviously really struggling with PTSD, though her coping mechanisms were not AT ALL what I expected of her.Then, it got good. It got good really quickly from there. Although I easily guessed who the DT Killer was (something I have never once done before with one of Jackson’s book), I was completely engrossed. All of the links tying him to the other novels proved just how much thought had gone into everything and I was very impressed. I was also completely on edge reading the scenes where he was near, such as the later stick figure scenes, Pip’s speakers sounding in the middle of the night and the printer going off as well.I must say that I disliked the fact that she still seemed to like Charlie, even after all of the PTSD Stanley’s death caused her and how much she was protesting him committing the act at the time. It was not a display of the Pippa Fitz-Amobi I knew.And then came the twist. The mass plot twist around half way through that completely ruined my bookish LIFE for the past few years. Killed all of my love for Pip and the series.SHE MURDERED HIM! SHE ACTUALLY FRICKING KILLED HIM WITH A HAMMER DESPITE GETTING AWAY!I must admit, the kidnapping scene happened not where I thought it would in the book, and her managing to escape was quite far fetched, but I was still rather enjoying it nonetheless at that point. Although I do strongly believe that the Pip I know (or thought I knew) would have guessed him the instant she read Andie’s email, but here we are.BUT THEN SHE KILLED HIM!And from there, it only got worse, with Ravi helping to clear up the scene, and then them involving Cara, Naomi, Jamie, Connor and Nat, establishing alibis together and FRAMING MAX FOR JASON BELL’S MURDER!I have never liked Max. I didn’t like him initially, I hated him when I found out he was a serial rapist and I despised him when his verdict was ‘not guilty’.BUT FRAMING HIM FOR MURDER, PIP? WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL?!?!?!The nice, extremely intelligent Pippa Fitz-Amobi that I admired, related to and ABSOLUTELY ADORED as a character, MURDERED SOMEONE AND FRAMED SOMEONE ELSE FOR IT!!! I will never see her in the same way again. I will never get the lovable young detective from Little Kilton back.And Ravi and the others still sticking by her side when they knew she was a murderer? Another instance for ‘what the actual frick?!’. I understand that the others didn’t know for sure, but who wouldn’t have guessed that?! I honestly could not believe it.The framing was ridiculous, with the changing of the Rigor and Livor Mortis with a car air con and miraculously removing all of Pip’s DNA from the crime scene. And her kind, protective parents not bothering to ask or be curious about her strange behaviours or the BIG CUT/SCAB ON HER FACE just makes no sense whatsoever! Breaking into Max’s house, drugging him, stealing his phone and clothes and taking some DNA to sprinkle at the scene? HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE? HOW IS THAT HUMANLY POSSIBLE?!Things I also don’t understand is how there were no traces of Ravi left at the crime scene and how Hawkins believed his headphones story, or why he even used it in the first place! Then, Pip at Cambridge can miraculously sleep after murdering someone BUT COULDN’T FOR MONTHS AND HAD TO TAKE DRUGS TO HELP HER AFTER SEEING STANLEY DIE?! She seems FAR more phased by his death that Jason’s, which makes literally no sense, not to mention super out of character!Then disconnecting completely from her family, severing all ties with her friends and Ravi... a) it’s just not Pip and b) wouldn’t that be even more suspicious to the police? This girl who adores her friends and family suddenly severing all ties? Come on!!I cannot believe it. I want to scream and cry and destroy that book in every way physically possible.Please do not read this book. Please do not ruin the most perfect series for yourself.It’s not worth it. I’ll never see it the same again.Jackson, what have you done?'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""Is it normal for one person to have this many enemies?To be fair, this book wasn't bad. But up till now, this has been my favorite YA mystery series for very specific reasons. And unfortunately, I feel like this last book in the trilogy completely jumped the shark.One of the reasons I adore this series is because of Pip. She's smart, fearless, and snarky, the perfect rendition of a modern-day Nancy Drew. But not in this book. In this book, she is angry and traumatized, and has turned into my least-favorite trope of all time: a pill-popping, freaking out, paranoid, therapy-is-not-for-me female narrator.Of course she's traumatized by what happened to her in the last two books. Who wouldn't be, if this was real life? But I don't always want darker and grittier and more realistic in everything I read. One of the main reasons I escape into books is to take comfort in strong characters who can kick ass again and again, rising from the ashes no matter what happens to them. So the fact that this book shat all over its strong female character is a huge disappointment.My other problem is the mystery, or lack thereof. In books 1 and 2, we follow Pip as she investigates, talks to suspects, gathers clues, and makes deductions. In other words, your standard Nancy Drew brought to life. But in this book, the mystery is just a small subset of the whole story, and it is over quickly, with barely any detecting.So what is this story taken up with? Well, the first 100 pages is devoted to Pip raging and popping pills. Then we mercifully get into the core mystery of this book, but that's wrapped up pretty quickly by the end of Part I. At that point, the book takes a turn in a direction I don't even recognize for this series and its characters. It is so out of left field that I was just stunned (and not in a good way).And to make matters worse, the entirety of Part II is obvious. It's clear what is going to happen, and the book just takes 200 pages to spell it out in long form. I don't have to have surprise after surprise in my books, but I'm not a fan of reading hundreds of pages when things can only go one way.Also, at the risk of sounding like an old fogey, I don't think this book is YA-appropriate. Books 1 and 2 were Young Adult, yes, but not this book. The fact that Pip skulks around and procures drugs from the neighborhood drug dealer, then inhales said drugs in order to take the edge off her trauma, not to mention what happens in the second half of the book, makes this one of the darkest books I have ever read, not just in YA.If you're thinking about reading this series, I still recommend it, especially books 1 and 2. Thankfully, each book is self-contained, with a mystery that's all wrapped up by the end. Each subsequent book does reference what happens in earlier ones, so read them in order for maximum spoiler-free enjoyment.If the other two books in this series didn't exist, I'm sure I would have enjoyed this and found very little cause for complaint. But they do, and I can't just erase them from my mind. I fell in love with the Pip and the mysteries of those books, so in comparison, this book was a shock and a disappointment.~~~~~~~~~~~~See also, my thoughts on:#1.A Good Girl's Guide to Murder#2.Good Girl, Bad Blood~~~~~~~~~~~~✧Connect with me✧Instagram✧""}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '""Pip\'s gut twisted with guilt; this was all her fault. Her family forced into a performance, trying twice as hard with her because she could barely try at all.""No one is more disappointed than I am that this book didn\'t speak to me the way I thought it would. I\'m about as invested in this series as a reader can be; I wrote the Book of the Month recommendation for their website for the first book and blurbed several marketing materials for the second, so I thought it would be an easy 5 stars once I picked up the third book and could wrap the series up with a neat little bow. Pip, her family, and her friends feel like family to me, and stepping into their world felt like a second home. The witty banter between our leading lady and Ravi sustains me in a way that few fictional couples can manage, and while I appreciate the darker turn that the end of book 2 made, I still feel like this one went in a direction that undermines the foundation of who these characters are in the first 2/3 of the series.The first half of this book is a slow burn, which I actually appreciated. Pip is really struggling with PTSD after the events of the ending from book 2, and she\'s developed a pill problem as a coping mechanism. We receive a lot of insight into her damaged psyche, and how it\'s deteriorated her relationships between her family, her friends, and even Ravi. I was on board for all of this and the deep development we get to see, and I didn\'t really start having issues with the book until around the halfway mark.If you\'ve read any other reviews, you\'ve likely seen that there is a major twist around the halfway mark, and it\'s not the revelation of the identity to the serial killer being discussed. I think most of us figured that out pretty early on, but what is shocking isthe fact that Pip murders Jason Bell after she\'s already escaped his kidnapping her, in a really brutal manner.. From this point on, there is a significant change in the tone and vibe of the book, and it splits majorly from what we know of our characters and their fundamental morals and beliefs. Not only does the above spoiler happen, but the rest of the book is basicallyPip wrangling Ravi and her friends into covering up her involvement, hiding the body, and framing Max for a murder he did not commit, which IMO is not tit for tat regarding the rape he was exonerated from. Oh yes, and then Pip basically cuts herself off from everyone she knows and loves. The end.This will definitely be a controversial installment, and if you\'re a big fan of the first two books, I\'m struggling with recommending this final story and letting you just preserve your experience via the first two. Either way, I applaud the author for covering some difficult topics, and respect her decision to finish out this series in the way she envisioned it. I will definitely be reading more from Holly Jackson in the future.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my review copy.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Hell no! No freaking way! It shouldn’t end like this! Here comes my semi unpopular review! I wish the second part of the book could be rewritten!

There's so much more story that could be told. I'm hoping she pulls a Maureen Johnson, a laThe Box in the Woods.By this point in the series, y'all know, Pip has been through it. This isn't a cozy YA Mystery series. Pip has faced very real dangers and she hasn't come out unscathed.Particularly after solving her last case, she's left with PTSD surrounding those events. Her emotional state of mind is fairly dark. She's struggling for real.Adding to her stress, because like all she's been through isn't enough, someone is harassing her.While Pip is used to trolls, any person with a public presence on the net is, she begins to take special notice when one particular troll asks her the same question over and over:who will look for you when you're the one who disappears?The harassment quickly escalates and Pip begins noticing things popping up around her house that indicate this person may be close by, watching her. Before long, there's no question, she has a stalker.As Pip starts to look into who this person might be, she discovers connections that may link her stalker to a local serial killer case purportedly solved six years ago. Is the wrong man in jail? Is the killer still on the loose? Will Pip be his next victim?When the police refuse to act on her behalf, Pip does the thing she is best at, she investigates herself. Is she finally in over her head?It's no secret that I absolutely love this series. Pip is one of my favorite characters in the literary world, but this novel finds her in a totally different headspace.Gone is our sparkling baby girl with all the optimism of a newborn pup. The world has beaten it out of her. She's seen the dark side of humanity in a way many people never do.I actually really appreciated that aspect of Pip's mental health being showcased. So many times in books, the protagonists go through incredibly horrific things and just seem to get over it. They bounce back in a way us regular peeps could never even dream of.The fact that Pip really struggles with recovering from her experiences made her feel that much more real to me. You can really empathize with her character.The tone of this entire story is much darker than the previous two and I feel like some people may not like it as much because of that. For me, it felt like the natural progression of Pip's story.As always, Pip is completely focused on the task at hand, even to the detriment of some of her relationships. I was concerned for a while about her relationship with Ravi; he's just such a gem.This one didn't turn out quite like I was expecting it to. There's one point where you think the story could be over, but then a huge twists sends it spinning off in a whole new direction.After this, I wouldn't say I was crazy about a lot of Pip's choices, but who am I to judge?As mentioned above, I would be super stoked if this weren't really the end. If it is though, I respect Jackson's decision and think she did an incredible job with this series.I would definitely reread all of these book again someday. I think it would be really fun to binge them back-to-back. If you haven't read this series yet, you better get cracking.

Although ""simple"" is not quite the right word, considering that said twist is murder.I absolutely LOVED this series! I loved everything about it, but I especially loved Pip - how smart she is, how determined, just everything about her. At first, my heart ached for her as she felt the need to take sleeping pills, even after her doctor took her off them. In the aftermath of the events in book 2, she suffered from PTSD and couldn\'t sleep anymore. She also kept seeing blood on her hands, so she didn\'t see a better way out.For more than half of the book, I could not put it down - it was that good.But then something happened. Besides the main storyline, Pip gets contacted by a woman who introduces her to another case that she then takes up on. It\'s about a guy confessing to crimes he didn\'t commit, because he was coerced into false confession by the police. It was the infamous case of a serial killer who murdered 5 women some years ago. As Pip takes matters into her own hands and investigates, she starts connecting that case with her own - the stalker who\'s been leaving dead pigeons in front of her house and who paints headless chalk stick figures in the driveway.Long story short, Pip finds out the identity of the actual murderer, when he manages to abduct her and plans to make her his sixth victim. She thinks she\'s as good as dead, but as fate would have it, she manages to escape.Here\'s where my issues begin: she flees through the woods, she\'s FREE. But then she turns around when she hears the killer return and decides to go back TO KILL HIM. Not just ""normal killing"", she hits him in the head. From behind. NINE TIMES. With a hammer!! 😐 That is overkill. Not self-defense or anything. Overkill. I get that she thought no one would believe her over some respectable white guy, that he might not even have been arrested. Her word against his. I get that she was mad at this whole situation, BUT all I could think wasThere are a million ways she could have gone on about this. She\'s Pip freaking Fitz-Amobi. She could have figured something out, for sure. And not only did she murder someone, she thinks it\'s a good idea to blame it on someone else. 😐😐 Yes, Max is rapist scum and deserved to go to prison. But for HIS crimes, not murder he didn\'t commit. For her to kill someone cold-blooded and then blame it on someone else? That is so wrong on so many levels 😐am I the only one feeling this way?Not only does she make it look like someone else is the killer, staging false evidence and coming up with an elaborate scheme, but she gets Ravi to help her and also a few of her friends 😕 that is so fucked up... And the way they handled a dead body, even made jokes during that time... But most of all, thinking it\'s ok to send someone else to jail for HER crime... just baffled me.If Pippa had PTSD from seeing up close how someone got fatally shot, how would she handle having hit a guy WITH A HAMMER!! TO THE HEAD!!? 9 TIMES!? For me, it wasn\'t enough that she distanced herself from her family, friends and boyfriend, only to later return when the trial was done and Max was convicted (supposing that\'s what happened in the end). It can\'t be that easy to get away with murder, even if you\'re a good person and the one who got killed deserved it.I guess I just wished she would have found a smart way to out the Duct Tape Killer in her podcast. Would that have been a little of a cliché? Yes. But it would have made more sense, in my opinion. And she wouldn\'t have been a freaking killer herself. You see, she didn\'t kill the guy in self-defense, she wasn\'t in a situation where that would have been the only option. She turned around and decided it\'s best to just go kill him. It was premeditated. That makes her a murderer too, and I can\'t be ok with that. It\'s just all so messed up 🙁OK, rant over. 😂 I probably repeated myself a bunch of times, but as stated before this is a rant 😂 sorry 🙈 To sum up, this was partly a huge disappointment and a terrible way to close off such a great series IMO.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'this was TRAUMATIZING. it’s been a year and i still think about the ending.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'i’m actually sobbing'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '#1A Good Girl’s Guide to Murder— 3.75 Stars#2Good Girl, Bad Blood— 4.5 StarsIt’s all fun and games until YOU’RE the one being stalked and chased by a serial killer . . . cause then you’re AS GOOD AS DEAD. 💀Last time, Pip had been the kind of someone who outdid the police in cracking murder and missing person cases. Now, she’s become the subject in her own investigation when a stalker starts pulling pranks on her and leaving dead headless pigeons on her front drive.***Spoilers are tagged, but I might unintentionally let something slip. So, beware!This book started off well (if a little surprising for me to discover as it no longer followed the same format as the previous two books).Then about halfway point, it pulled the rug under my feet by handing me thetwist(Pip deliberately commits a murder)of a lifetime. . .*It wasn’t mind blowing in and of itself, but my mind did get blown by the audacity of it all.To put it simply,the aforementioned, unexpected turn of events KILLED the book for me as it became less about solving a MYSTERY andmoreaboutHOW TO GET AWAY WITH MURDER. As much as I’m appreciative of the knowledge being imparted (cause I’m sure I’ll put it to good use in the future*cue me being sarcastic*), I DID NOT WANT THIS FOR PIP. 😭On the other hand, I can see why it would be the perfect route to take in bringing this trilogy to an end. Taking into account what had happened (Pip losing faith in the justice system, Pip witnessing a murder, Pip feeling guilty about not being able to save someone from book 2, Pip suffering from PTSD), it was only fair that this book would focus on her as all of those surely took a toll on her mentally and then some. It’s just that, along with it, I’m also questioning the believability, e.g.:➝ How is it that among all the DT Killer’s victims, only Pip (AN 18 YEAR OLD) managed to get away? Was it luck? Was it some statistics thing, like‘one out of six serial killer’s victims is more likely to survive than others’? Was it merely survival instinct and self-perseverance?➝ How is it that after committing rape and a number of murders the DT Killer was easily deveated by AN 18 YEAR OLD? Was it his skills getting rusty? Was it purely him underestimating his victim? Was it all because it wasdestinyand he had it coming? Huh. I suppose it’s all of the above.➝ It also didn’t sit well with me the fact that Pip *roped* her friends into helping herget away with it, and they turned that narrative into them “taking justice into their own hands.” Or the fact that the police was continuously portrayed as nothing but a useless 🤡 throughout the series. I was mad everytime they turned Pip down when she needed their service.Okay, so maybe it wasn’tentirelyimplausible (or maybe I’m just too naïve and clueless of how the world works and think too highly of humanity). Regardless, I loved how all the mystery or cases from book 1 and 2 were brought together and tied into this one. This book was bringing everything full circle. Not to mention,the moral gray-ness in this finale was the blurriest amongst all the books. I appreciated the dark turn this installment took. On another note, it sucked that we didn’t get to see Pip with her friends as much, but her relationship with Ravi and their banter was cute and adorable (if also got a tad emotional towards the end).I’m wrapping up by telling you about the audiobook. I absolutely loved the audiobooks for AGGGTM and GGBB, but I was a bit let down by this one. Firstly, this book was written just like any other novel—no more newspaper clippings, charts, text screenshots, and interview recordings. Secondly, Idk if the publishers made two audio versions (UK & US) for each book, butthe first two audiobooks I listened to were full casts and narrated in the American accent. Meanwhile,this was singly narrated in the English accent. I have to say that I preferred the American ones. The performance was truly unmatched.To sum up, this conclusion was interesting and intense but leaning more towards disappointing. I didn’t agree with the direction it took, and I didn’t feel assured by the ending. However, I can understand why it had to go this way, and I didn’t outrightly hate the book. As a matter of fact, I have a lot of admiration towards the series. It’s definitely become my favorite in the YA category. If you’re gearing up to read this book, don’t expect it to be like the first two. Prepare for all the moral dilemma it’ll cause and get ready to be mindblown—whether in a good or bad way, that’s for you to find out.(Read as an Audiobook)'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Imagine the kind of research Holly Jackson had to do in order to write this book ☠️☠️This was a wild conclusion to a wild series! I'll try to give some non-spoilery opinions here and hopefully keep it short.Let's begin by saying that I didn't love this book as much as I loved the first two. I haven't read Kill Joy (but I'm planning to), so you can expect that sometime in the near future. This book was the longest in the series and had the slowest start. It took me about 100-150 pages to get into the plot and for a thriller, that's not really good. When reading this genre, the sole purpose of the book is to hook you from page 1. This wasn't the case here and I continued reading only because it featured characters I grew to love and care for. So, if it weren't for Pip and Ravi (thank you Pip and Ravi!), this would've been a DNF.After those first 150 pages, this got GOOD. And when I say good, I actually mean GREAT. It was chilling, it was scary, it kept me on the edge of my seat (atp I'm glued down to this damn couch). Pip got in some serious trouble this time and the stakes were much much higher than in the previous two installments. That's all I'm really gonna say about this book bc going into it blind is what I would recommend.Romance is only a tiny tiny subplot in this series but PipRavi really said VENI VIDI VINCI. They served like never before! Truly one of my favorite book couples of all time! And I feel like because EVERYTHING WENT WRONG in this book, it was their time to shine. Their emotional connection and love really came through and I was living for it!This is another issue I had with this book, so I'll say it and wait for you to crucify me: I'M SICK AND TIRED OF THE ANTAGONISTS AND THEIR CRIMES (and y'all know who they are). I needed fresh new people (and yes I know Pip is from a small town but are you trying to convince me their population is 10 people???). I get that the idea was the shock factor you can't really give us unless it's people-we-know-turning-bad, but c'mon!I was told there would be all these attractive singlesSo yeah, in other words, the bad guys got a bit repetitive. Just how many crimes can 10 people commit?Patiently waiting for Holly Jackson to drop new books so I can theorize about murderers and be tragically wrong again!🤪🤪""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I. AM. ANGRY. words cannot describe the anger this put me through but i’m writing this for Ravi who deserved better😌⚠️MASSIVE SPOILERS⚠️Firstly, the book starts off with Pip acting very out of character, from her buying drugs from the guy who supplied them to Max who used them to rape Becca and then becoming addicted to them because of her PTSD. To her ignoring her loved ones (even poor Ravi) when they are concerned for her moral character.In the book the killer sends Pip cryptic messages asking her “whose gonna look for you when you disappear” and this girl literally counts everyone in her life (Ravi, Connor, Jamie, Nat, Becca , her mom and dad) and is like “i mean i guess they would look for me 👉👈 but would Ravi???” like huh?? what does he have to do to prove to you that he loves you?? he already has been through so much for Pip from rehashing the trauma from his brothers murder to helping her through the case of Child Brunswick in the previous book. I mean he literally says they are Team Pip and Ravi and she still questions his love for her. Like if that isn’t toxic idek what is.But here is where things get crazy okay. This girl gets kidnapped by the killer and ESCAPES only to come back to MURDER THIS MAN because of her PTSD?? i’m still confused why, and then she proceeds to call Ravi to help her FRAME THE MURDER on Max. ❓⁉️I would like to remind the audience that Ravi’s brother, Sal, was ✨MURDERED AND FRAMED✨ that’s right ladies and gentlemen, and Pippus Maximus over here wants Ravi to help her FRAME a man *she* MURDERED. I don’t know if the author intended these parallels to happen but it was incredibly infuriating to read when the situation hit a little too close to home for Ravi. I mean you would think that he would have learned something from his brothers mistakes, he admitted in the previous books that he felt his brother was too naive and maybe too nice which is why he met such a terrible fate. So then why have Ravi be so willing to help Pip especially if he is supposed to be her moral compass?? make it make sense.So, Ravi only wanting to be there for Pip because the author made him believe that she was the only thing he has left, agrees to help her hide and frame what she did 😃. The fact that the author knew that if they just made Pip do it on her own it would make her seem like a monster so they had to throw innocent, lovable, Ravi in the mix to justify her actions. I mean he literally tries to justify Pips actions FOR her. 🤧Skipping past all of the unforgivable things that Pip did that infuriated me now so I can talk about the absolute monstrosity the ending was.AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGHGHHGHHHHHGHHHHGPIP LITERALLY BREAKS UP WITH RAVI. ⁉️she claims she is trying to save him from herself but she is just being a total and utterly horrible narcissist. And don’t worry i’ll explain exactly why. Ravi who had just helped her FRAME SOMEONE ELSE FOR MURDER is obviously going through it. It would be safe to assume that he would be feeling immense guilt, trauma, and remorse, especially because of his experience with his own brother getting murdered and framed. But he put all of that aside FOR PIP. You would think that after being an accomplice with someone in order to protect them you would both help each other through the experience. but NOPE. Pip got what she needed from Ravi and is now done. Pip thinks she is doing such a great job at protecting Ravi by leaving him after making him feel like she was the only person he had and abandons him to deal with it on his own.And for those who think I’m exaggerating here is an exact quote from the book on pg 444 “Ravi broke behind her, crying out into the trees, the wind carrying his sobs over her, trying to pull her back. She kept going.” yessir, she made this boy help her frame someone for murder only a few days ago and keep it a secret only to break up with him and walk away.But here’s the real kicker folks, SHE DOESN’T EVEN FULLY BREAK UP WITH HIM. SHE MAKES HIM BELIEVE SHE MIGHT COME BACK. She’s like, “i can be with you if max is convicted of being guilty to the murder. So i might come back, might not 🥰” ????? Why is she leaving him hanging?? If Pip really cared about Ravi she would break up with him and ask him to move on because she is dangerous. If she had his best interests in heart she would know that he deserved someone else and it would also add some character development because she would be SELF AWARE. It would make sense. Not her telling him they can be together if her plan which involved Ravi is successful. If she truly wanted to protect Ravi she would have LET. HIM. GO. for good.This is only a fraction of the anger this book caused me and I literally cannot describe my thoughts accurately. But i wanted to bring some sort of justice to poor Ravi.And so here are my final words: Ravi 🥺, you deserve better. And Pip 🤡, you’re a clown.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Daję 5 gwiazdek z sentymentu do serii, bo w sumie to bardziej 4,5.To nie jest moralnie dobra książka, już drugi tom był na granicy, ale to ile satysfakcji daje mi czytanie przygód Pip zasługuje na wyróżnienie.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '“But she was dead in all the ways that mattered. As good as.”What a RIDE!!!!!This trilogy has been a sensation! Book three definitely takes us in a different direction than the first two but I loved it!After the events of Good Girl Bad Blood, Pip is struggling with PTSD and has even developed a pill habit. When she discovers some strange occurrences that lead her to believe someone is stalking her, the police don’t believe her. They think it is just relayed to her trauma.Looks like Pip is going to have to handle this herself, and when she notices similarities with a closed case of a serial killer, things go from bad to worse.I know a few reviewers have questioned whether it is right that Pip frames Max Hastings for the murder of Jason Bell who is actually the DT killer. I for one think it is more than valid. Max Hastings is a serial rapist - responsible for destroying numerous lives. He only goes down for destroying one life. So honestly? Fuck that guy he deserves everything he gets.I loved the fast pace, as always and the wonderful characters both to love and to hate. Pip’s relationship with Ravi is absolute goals.though I don’t see why she felt the need to cut everyone off until Max had been found guilty. However - it just made that little message from Ravi at the end even cuter 🥰 “Hey Sarge.

TITLE REVEAL!'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '❝You\'ve lost your mind❞❝Maybe. So you should be terrified❞Honestly, I want to give this book one star so bad. I’m free and disappointed, but not exactly surprised. The only reason this isn’t getting a one-star review is RaviPip ship. Their relationship is literally the only thing that saved this for me. I was this close 🤏 to calling it quits because, let\'s be real—this series didn’t even give me a single spine-chilling moment.I’m not even joking when I say thatKill Joywas scarier than the main three books. Yeah, you read that right. The plot twist? I saw it coming from the first 30%. The second Jason Bell showed up, he was on my list of suspects. So, when it turned out he was the killer? I was like, “Okay, cool… next.”Here’s the thing.. an entire “thriller series” didn’t even shock me once. Like, I was seriously bored. I didn’t get a single gasp or any jaw-dropping moments. I’m sorry, but after reading this, I’m just done. You know what? The only part that gave me chills was that one scene where they found Pip’s headphones. *That* was it. That’s the only part that hit right. Otherwise, the rest felt like a missed opportunity.Let’s talk about the plot for a sec. Like I said, I saw the twist coming from a mile away. Jason Bell? Totally figured it out. The whole thing with the “murderer gene” and the psychopath bloodlines was obvious from the get-go.I’ve learned fromdefending Jacobwhich is called [The murder gene] it’s basically if there’s a psychopath/ murderer this killer gene will go in his bloodline. So at the start of the book when I started suspecting dawn/ Jason bell. I remembered the murderer gene (Their daughter is a murderer) and I mean, when I read about the ropes, duct tape, and the hairbrush? Come on. Those were the clues staring me in the face. Halfway through, I knew what was up—Andie’s unsent email just confirmed all my suspicions.Here’s where I’m mad: I thought, ""Okay, the wife—Dawn—must be the killer!"" I’m not gonna lie, I was really hoping she was. If you ask me, it would’ve been such a killer plot twist—such a slap to Pip’s face. But no. It was Jason. I get why he could’ve been the one, but seriously, Dawn being the mastermind would’ve been such a wild turn. And you know what? There was this moment when one of the victims lost their necklace, and I just knew Dawn had something to do with it. The necklace, the watch, the earrings? All stuff I thought would connect back to her. But nope, she wasn’t the killer, and I was pissed.After reading that one of the victims lost her neckless I immediately recognized Dawn’s neckless at the scene where she was walking past pip when she held it around her fingers (bc I know authors mention things that always matter in pacing by ways) and my suspicion was proven right it was for one of the victims And the fact that all the missing items from the victims were hair brush/ neckless/ watch/ earrings… I know even men wear these things but I’m just saying between looking at him and his wife I’ll say the wife might me interested in such things. And I was right he was stealing these things and giving them to his wife and daughters.Now, let me talk about the writing. It was just bland. The characters didn’t have any depth to them. Like, there was no exploration of their fears, their past, or their motivations. We were just told, “Here’s Pip. Here’s Ravi. They’re doing things.” But I didn’t feel any of it. Pip was putting herself in life-threatening situations just for the thrill? And Ravi was doing everything just to be there for her? That’s not enough to make me care. And then we have the serial killer… who we know nothing about. Like, why was he like that? What made him this way? Could’ve been a real moment to dive deep, but instead, we got... nothing.As for the spooky factor? It was nonexistent. I wanted that creepy atmosphere, the kind of eerie tension that makes you look over your shoulder while you read. I was hoping for more of those “Oh, hell no” moments, but instead, the whole thing just felt flat. There was no atmosphere, no buildup, no nothing. So yeah, the suspense didn’t land. It felt like every twist was telegraphed before it happened.And let’s talk about the predictability. It was way* too easy to guess what was coming. I mean, there was no real mystery here. Throw in a couple more suspects, some unexpected motivations, and maybe we could’ve had something worth reading. But no. I knew exactly where it was headed.And I’m sorry, but I have to call out the writing here. Holly Jackson could’ve really stepped up the prose—better sentence structure, tighter vocab, something to make it shine. It wasn’t horrible, but it definitely wasn’t anything special.But, like, I’m not trying to rain on the whole book. It had its moments. The relationship between Pip and Ravi? Iconic. Seriously, their dynamic is the only thing that kept me from throwing this book across the room. Their bond was real—and honestly, it was the one thing that made me care. I loved how they balanced each other out, how they saved each other when things were spiraling. Ravi’s loyalty? 10/10 Their bond is definitely one for the books (pun intended).And yeah, Pip had her moments where she made me want to throw hands—especially with the whole “I’m gonna hide a body and hope Ravi doesn’t notice” move. Sis, are you serious? If she’d just been open with Ravi from the start, we wouldn’t have had any of this mess. But despite that, the way they took on this huge, risky thing together made their relationship stronger in the end. And I gotta admit, that was the one part that almost made me forget about everything else.Almost. Because I didn’t.So yeah The biggest reason this book didn’t get a one-star from me was that I lowkey live for the way Pip and Ravi were there for each other.Pip Fitz-Amobi? Honestly, what a hot mess. She’s meant to be this complex character, but at the end of the day, she was just frustrating. She’s popping pills after committing murder, and then all of a sudden, she’s like, “Oh wait, I’m done with them now."" Like, girl, what? That whole “I’m taking control of my life” arc? Yeah, never happened. She never really learned from her mistakes, either. She’s just... stuck in her own mess.Now, let’s get into the real part of this book. The murder itself? That was actually kind of satisfying. Killing a serial killer and putting the blame on a rapist? Damn, I’ll take it. The buildup to it was solid. The rage behind it, the way Pip finally snapped—it felt real. And that tiny flaw in her plan? It made the whole thing feel so much more authentic. I loved that little glitch in the perfect plan. And you know what? It made the relationship between Pip and Ravi even stronger.So yeah, I gave it 2 stars, not 1. Because honestly, their relationship was everything.The Relationship 💕❝It\'s me and you, trouble. Team Ravi and Pip❞I never thought their relationship would get this deep, but here we are. I mean, if my man’s not willing to hide a body with me, what’s the point? (Just kidding, don’t actually try that.) But I love how they’re each other’s safe space. Every time Pip is spiraling, she thinks of Ravi. It’s like he’s the one thing that keeps her grounded, and I was here for that. I don’t even care if it’s cheesy; it works.“No thoughts beyond the first insane thing that came into her head. No deeper, no darker. Ravi was the fence in her head that kept it all back.”I swear, whenever things got dark for Pip, imagining Ravi was what kept her from completely losing it.the fact that 1 year, 8 months and 16 days later, 3 minutes after the verdict was read in The Crown vs. Max Hastings, Ravi texted Her!”Hey Sarge, remember me?”Oh, and one last thing? If you hate Andie Bell, please stay away from me. I’m her #1 defender.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '4.5 starsokay wow. this book took acompletelydifferent turn from the others. not necessarily in a good way. however, i still thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. i was in a slump as i finished up this book but that did not stop me from liking it. the reason it took me so long to finish was partly bc of the fact that i took breaks from 12-14 and 16-17. still not completely sure about my rating but we’re settling with it for now.the beginning of this book has a very interesting start. it’s a bit morbid, but nonetheless gets straight to the point. it’s clear that pip’s hate for max makes her lash out. and she also “ruined” every single happy moment she had with her friends by thinking about the ending of the second book. i think that this book alluded to quite a few things in the beginning since i went into this book knowing all the spoilers and everything.“You’re Pippa Fricking Fitz-Amobi. My little Sarge. Pippus Maximus, and there’s nothing you can’t do.”She cried and she let herself cry, a few minutes to grieve for the girl she could never be again.pip, my sweet girl. she is the epitome of would’ve, could’ve, should’ve by taylor swift in this book. i gotta say i loved her in the first 2 books. despite her lacking personality, she was still such an enjoyable character, and something that rlly stuck with me throughout this series was the fact that they never lost their true self. with this book, it takes a completely different turn, given she has completely lost herself, and has become this paranoid person who cannot sleep and has so much pressure on her. i can’t say i can necessarily embrace the change. however she is not to blame given the trauma she suffered from the last two. not to mention she felt all alone and as though she wasn’t normal because every case that she was involved in everyone believes that the ppl who commuted it are monsters. however, she felt like she understood them and why they did it, and she had no one to talk to about it bc it’s morally known as “wrong” and no one would get it.He hated confrontation, hated it, and even so, Pip knew he would go to war for her if she ever asked.It’s me and you, trouble. Team Ravi and Pip.ravi. the light in pip’s world. oh how i loved them together. the way he was able to stick by her side throughout everything was just so sweet. their relationship was at its peak in this book. he believed her through everything and never once doubted her, even when everyone thought she was crazy for thinking she had a stalker. he was able to reassure her and help her through everything and it was just amazing. despite the ending that they had, the love they had for each other was present in everything they did. that ending had me bawling my eyes out. their interactions had every emotion associated with it, from laughter to sadness and anger.the writing was very repetitive throughout the story as a way to convey pip’s ptsd which i appreciated. i always enjoyed holly jackson’s writing style bc of how simple it was and how easy it is to follow. it was also able to perfectly portray the love pip and ravi had for each other and it was just.. beautiful. i loved it. it also really hones in on the emotions and feelings of pip and how she felt. she felt as though she wasn’t normal because of how “blurred” the lines were in her last investigations.“I wasn’t going to leave you alone in there with him,” Nat said firmly. “Not until I knew you were safe.”after everything that nat and pip have been through, i am so glad that she was able to bond with pip nonetheless and put aside their differences in the first few books. i rlly enjoyed reading abt their friendship and how nat tried her best to look out for her and made sure she was safe. it was also so sweet to see her and jamie get together after everything in the second book. nat deserves all the happiness <3 she’s such a strong character and i just loved her, especially in this one.spoilers from this point on!!i hated the uncertainty of everything in this book. for one, she had to get her friends involved and they were super uneasy while doing their part. they never even got confirmation of what happened and the ending was also open ended. not to mention the only role that her friends played was to help cover up a murder they were unsure about this entire time. i think it kind of frustrated me for them to never get confirmation and inevitably entangle themselves in a murder despite the fact that it was necessary for everything to happen.“How would we get away with this?” he said, the question almost ridiculous enough for a smile.How to get away with murder.Pip felt it again; that creeping feeling up her spine, cold and inevitable. Like everything was playing out the way it was always supposed to, from the start. Coming full circle. And she was simply a passenger inside her own body, watching the show play out.in the beginning, pip was attempting to save herself after everything that she has gone through and her life was becoming consumed in trying to save herself. given that her last few cases had a good motive for all the terrible things that each character did, it made pip very conflicted and i understood her. on the second part, everything took a turn and i love how well thought out it was and everything on pip’s part. she tried her best not to involve anyone and it’s clear how much she loves her friends in her life. the difference with the crime that pip committed was the fact that the ppl she got involved (max) deserved everything coming to them (jason). it showed that the justice system rlly was flawed and sometimes you need to take things into your own hands.“This is why it all happened. Everything. Full circle,” she added quietly. The beginning was the end and the end the beginning,and DT was both.“That’s not how it’s supposed to be. You’re supposed to listen to me. That’s all. Listen and do what you’re told. How is that so hard?”Jason Bell was dead, but he wasn’t dead yet; he would be in a few hours. And Max Hastings would be the one who killed him. Finally locked away where he belonged.i hated jason bell with a passion, especially after reading this book. in the beginning, i found it to be childish how he started a fight with max given that he was a grown ass adult and max was still growing. after i found out that he drowned barney, my hatred for him doubled. he also had this mindset that everyone needed to listen to him and when they didn’t, he felt the need to kill them which i just hated. he’s everything that is wrong in this world, thinking women need to listen to men and believing we should not speak up, which absolutely infuriates me.This feels too big for me, but I think I can do it. Save us. Keep Becca safe. Survive.Pip wasn’t there to save Andie, but maybe Andie was there to save her.i didn’t expect andie bell to have a factor in this book but knowing she had to live with a dark secret and keep it from everyone she knew was just so sad. it was obvious that she loved sal and becca dearly and she seemed so sweet in the unsent email she wrote. all she wanted was to try and get away from her murderous father and save her sister along the way. and the way she was “saving” pip was something that i found to be wholesome. the love she had for sal was also so similar to pip and ravi’s love. i think that her character arc really shows that you never know when someone is suffering.“It sucks when someone puts something in your drink and then ruins your life, huh?”And Pip knew, as her eyes trailed away from him, that this wasn’t just about her own survival; she knew herself well enough by now. Had reckoned with that dark place in her mind long enough.This was also revenge.This town wasn’t big enough for the both of them. This world wasn’t. One of them had to go, and Pip was going to give one hell of a fight.i feel like max got what was coming for him after everything that he has done. i understand why pip saw red every single time she spotted him. he deserved everything that happened to him and i am so glad that he was placed in jail, even if drastic measures had to be taken to get him there. when pip had the vision of throwing max in front of a bus and punching him, i was honest to god worried until i realized it was a vision. this book really shows that when the justice system won’t take things seriously, you have to take them in your own hands.“I’m a ticking time bomb, Ravi. I can’t have the people I love near me when it goes off.Especially not you.”He couldn’t be her person and she couldn’t be his right now. Pip had to be the strong one, the one to walk away when neither of them wanted it.The one who chose.“You’re my Pip and I’m your Ravi. We’re a team.” 🥹after everything that pip and ravi have been together, i have no doubt that they got back together. knowing that they were willing to choose each other makes me have hope that they would continue to at any given time, even694 daysafter having no contact. the way ravi begged her to stay and not leave him made my heart ache for them. i feel so sad knowing that their happy ending isn’t confirmed. like wdym i don’t see them have a happy epilogue where they’re married and together?! i’m utterly obsessed with them 😩ˏˋ°•*⁀➷kill joy - 2.5 starsa good girl’s guide to murder - 4.25 starsgood girl, bad blood - 4.75 starsas good as dead - 4.5 starspre-reviewyou don’t know true pain and emotional damage until you’ve read this book. trust me on this. rtcmaybe<3reading reviewOK BRING ON THE SCARY IM READY NOW!!(i’m terrified)pre-read reviewhow much of the plot for this book have i spoiled for myself? i myself have no idea'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '˚₊‧꒰ა 5 stars ☆ ໒꒱ ‧₊˚༉‧₊˚. «Save herself to save herself.» ・₊✧˗ˏˋ ‼️SPOILER WARNING‼️ ˎˊ˗soo i know how late this review is 😍 it took me a while to process everything that has happened throughout the book. people told me this would be dark. however, i don’t think anything would prepare me forthis. with this book, i went through five stages of grief.i had so many theories about what was gonna happen and i was stressed out 😃how didPipandRaviplan this WHOLE thing in a few minutes? she’s such a genius and i don’t know how she does it honestly. she’s my idol.

It’s a long drive but spirits are high. Until the RV breaks down in the middle of nowhere. There’s no mobile phone reception and nobody around to help. And as the wheels are shot out, one by one, the friends realise that this is no accident. There’s a sniper out there in the dark watching them and he knows exactly who they are. One of the group has a secret that the sniper is willing to kill for.A game of cat-and-mouse plays out as the group desperately tries to get help and to work out which member of the group is the target. Buried secrets are forced to light in the cramped, claustrophobic setting of the RV, and tensions within the group will reach deadly levels. Not everyone will survive the night.","[{'rating': 4, 'content': ""I’m not sure what exactly I was expecting from this YA thriller, but having tears stream down my face towards the end was NOT on my agenda. Could I be the victim of a sudden paper allergy? Was someone cutting onions nearby?? Either way, ‘Five Survive’ had me hooked to the page and more invested than I ever consciously realized. Leave it to Holly Jackson I guess!!There must be some kind of magic in this book, because how in the world can you write 400 pages in the same setting, over just 8 hours, and somehow make it a page turner? A risk was taken, and the payoff was amazing! I think the secret and at least one of the reveals was a bit obvious, but I was shocked by the other plot twists and the balance between the two was incredibly enjoyable. I love solving something correctly to boost my ego a bit, while also having to scrape my jaw off the floor at times; it’s the perfect combination!Jackson is quickly becoming a favorite YA author of mine; it’s so hard to find adults who can write realistic teenage minds and interactions, and she hits the nail on the head every time! This novel was such a fantastic exploration on trauma, guilt, and how people transform once they're in a life threatening situation. Loved every page!SPOILERSAs far as characters go, I thought Red and Oliver in particular were very compelling and well developed; the latter especially was increasingly terrifying as the book went on, and I loved the juxtaposition between the him and the sniper as different kinds of antagonists. I do wish we got to see more of Arthur and Maddy’s personalities, but I understand that it was important for them to not be explored in depth until the end for the sake of the plot, and the reveals definitely made that worth it!In the end, I’m still not exactly sure how I feel about Arthur; Arthur and Red together to be specific. If I were her, I’m not sure I’d ever be able to trust him again, but they were pretty cute together, I cannot lie!! One of my favorite aspects of the book was how the very end mirrored the finale of the A Good Girl’s Guide To Murder series, it was such a heartfelt nod to Pip and Ravi but still distinctly Arthur and Red, I absolutely adored it.Overall, my expectations for ‘Five Survive’ were well exceeded; that scene with Red and her mother at the end?? I was crying like a baby, it was so beautifully done. Everything was tied up perfectly, while still leaving an open end for us to decide what happens, possibly my favorite way for a book to end.P.S. Maybe I just missed it, but did we ever find out the significance of the curtain pattern?I need to know, ok bye""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'i have conflicting feelings about this one.on one hand, the story is super fast-paced. the entire plot takes place over the span of 8 hours, so i guess it would have to be. the vast majority of the narrative (~80%) is dialogue, so that also contributes to the fast pacing. and these things are conducive for a good thriller, as nothing feels like its dragging. it definitely has a “keep you on the edge of your seat” kind of feel.that being said, i still managed to get somewhat bored with this. none of the characters are likeable and i didnt care if any of them died, the one setting itself (RV on the side of the road) isnt exciting, and the “secret” is very predictable.readers who enjoy a locked-in/cornered kind of scenario might enjoy this more than i did, but i personally dont think this is HJs best work.thank you for the ARC, random house/delacorte press!↠3 stars'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""(4.5 stars) Um.

It was so interesting to read about their dynamic with one another, their secrets, and how they all react under the pressure of a life-or-death situation. PLUS, the whole story takes place in less than 24 hours inside an RV which is such a unique concept, setting, and timeline.I wasn't sure I could love a YA mystery as much as A Good Girls Guide to Murder, but Holly Jackson does it again 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'five people survived this book but i sure as hell am not one of them'}, {'rating': None, 'content': 'I WOULD READ ANYTHING HOLLY JACKSON WRITES AND THAT IS A FACT'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""i'm just glad Oliver diedsorry to everyone who got it spoiled i had a spoiler warning on it but it removed itself idk what happed but u put it back up sorry""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': '3.5when he kills for u 🙏'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'wtf was that'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': ""2.5 stars, rounded upThe beginning of this book was fairly exciting and really captured my interest. A group of six young adults are in a motor home heading for a spring break trip. They take a series of wrong turns and end up stranded in the woods in the middle of nowhere with no cell service. Then someone shoots out all of their tires and their gas tank. They are given a walkie talkie and are given a short amount of time to come up with the answer to a secret or they will be killed. Who is holding the secret? Is there a mole in their midst?This is told from the point of view of Red, a girl whose police officer mom was killed in the line of duty. Red drove me nuts--she can't remember anything, basically acts like a bumbling weirdo, and I never warmed to her at all even though I was supposed to like her. I also hated Oliver, the oldest and most annoying character.There's a part through the middle that just drags and drags and finally when things start to happen they wrap up quickly. Obviously from the title someone dies, so I knew that most of them would make it through.For a YA mystery, this one is just okay. Don't expect Good Girls Guide to Murder and you won't be too disappointed. I listened to the audiobook and I think Red was even more annoying having to listen to her weirdness.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '(this is a such lame review, SORRY)so let’s get to it.this book reads like a movie. i honestly should’ve made time to read this in one sitting because the story takes place over the span of 8 hours and reading it in one go would have been so much more immersive. if you have the time to binge this,do it!!you guys…that ending🥲🤍finallya thriller with an ending that didn’t feel too rushed or impracticalmy unlucky spell of below average thrillers is broken,hallelujah!!'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'I’m convinced Holly Jackson is incapable of writing a bad book. This was INCREDIBLE— speechless right now 😭'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""─ 1 star🖇 ┊ 𖥻 ya mystery-thriller⤿review will contain major spoilers𖥻 “ what if I said you were the right people, in the right place at exactly the right time. ”couldn't care less if none of them survivedi think Holly Jackson was being ambitious with this book because i can imagine that writing a thriller that's set in the same place in just a few hours is very challenging. the setting of this book was enough for me to pick it up because the entire premise of being stuck in an RV with a sniper outside was interesting but the execution... i found it to be very boring and underwhelming.there are some redeeming qualities to this book so i can understand why it was so well-loved. however, it was just not it for me and here area lota few reasons why;1.the curtain. i think i need to start with this damn curtain becauseTELL ME WHYthis curtain wasrepeatedlytalked about throughout the novel and it was not even significant to thebig reveal?WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THISDUMBASSCURTAIN?this stupid curtain was like half of this book and it made my eye twitch. i think this curtain actually had more screentime (page-time?) than half of the characters inside the stupid rv. this curtain was enough for me to want to rip every single curtain in my apartment because of the amount of times that it was mentioned.2.the setting. as previously mentioned, the setting was interesting and creative but on paper... it was very boring. being stuck in a 31-foot rv (which red made sure that WE ALL KNEW) + having the entire thing take place in just a couple of hours makes it impossible for the characters to develop. i feel like this whole concept would've worked better as a movie than a book.3.did i mention that it was boring? but yes this was very boring. i had the expectation that thrillers would be more of a page-turner experience but with this booktrying to flip a page made me miserable because i just didn't care. it was just the same cycle repeatedly and it doesn't help thatall the charactershad no depth and were just downright unlikeable.- this was honestly a shame because it started out so good but everything went downhill when they got stuck in the RV, which was the entire plot btw 😭, and it only started picking back up at around the 60% mark but by that time i just didn't care and wanted for it to end.- i think the only parts that i liked was the beginning (before they got stuck), the oliver + reyna drama (admittedly made me giggle because i am oliver's no. 1 hater), and the ending (although a little bit surprising, i was underwhelmed because the middle was painfully boring).4.the characters. when i said that i couldn't care less if none of them survived i 100% stand by that. if not dull then they are not likeable AT ALL. this is coming from someone who doesn't mind annoying + unlikeable characters BUT OLIVER? i wanted to throw that man outside the RV.red. dull and mildly irritating from how passive she is? kind of made me want to throw her outside the RV as well because what do you mean you have a really big secret that no one can know but it's not you that the sniper wants? girl you are almost an adult not a pre-teen 😭 this might sound insensitive because i know she has a lot of trauma but girl please stop with the inner monologues.WE GET IT YOU FEEL BAD AWW ☹️ BUT LETS ALL MOVE ON PLEASE. her inner monologues were also very irritating to read and i just hate thebroken-girl-get-saved-by-the-supposed-bad guy trope.to be honest i was a little bit sad when she survived.reyna & maddie. had no backbone. barely contributed anything but they were oliver-adjacent so i disliked them for that. again, i was a little bit sad when they both survived because they were just annoying. well i am quite happy that reyna survived because she cheated on oliver 🤭 but as for maddie... yeah it was her fault for following herdumbassbrother like girl get a grip please.arthur & simon. the curtain had more screentime than the both of them combined 🤷\u200d♀️ i can't even consider simon as comedic relief because he haspre-teen fortnight playertype humour. as for arthur... don't really care about him or the fact that he's the mole because by that time i just wanted for the whole thing to be over.oliver. if oliver has 0 haters then i'm dead. honestly would have given this book 1 star but the fact that oliver died was enough for it to be 2 stars.5.the reveal. now i would be lying if i said that i wasn't slightly shocked. some parts of it i definitely didn't expect but again, i was so bored that i did not care and i'm just glad that it was over. some parts i already guessed which made it slightly unenjoyable to read (i mean red was not very subtle) but it was overall underwhelming and wasn't enough for me to fully appreciate this book.⤿ overall. was very disappointing and underwhelming so i'm hoping thata good girl's guide to murderis better.# all reviews are opinions of my own and you should experience a book before giving your own. happy reading! 💌""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""4.8/5 *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧Do you like high stakes, drama in every chapter and unexpected twists & turns? This is for you.I honestly think I could give this 5/5. In my opinion, the flaws were so minor I didn't notice them at all. I could not put this book down at all. Every page I wanted to know what happened next. I was glued to it for 4 hours I think? It did not leave my hand.I thought oh man I guessed the plot twist - and I mean I *sort of* did - but it was so much bigger than I expected, so much more jaw dropping. For my first Holly Jackson book - I have such high praises for her and will most certainly be reading everything else she has to offer.I don't know if it's naïve of me that I can't find a fault in this book. The pacing, the characters, the plot - all amazing. My own personal enjoyment, 5/5. My heart was thudding in my chest. So good. Maybe my favourite thriller of the year.If you read my reading log, you'll see I looked a tad silly 😅 (I've marked the spoilers.)︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶⠀୨♡୧⠀︶︶︶ ⊹ ︶︶︶˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ PlotOkay so hear me out. My heart was thudding, this wasn't like every other thriller I've read. It was fast paced, easy to read so if you need out of a slump, this would be great. It gave of very Lord of the Flies vibes and I did shed a tear at the end. Something new happened every chapter, full of drama. Every character had drama. Everything felt like it was relevant, had a point, and tied together in the end in a neat little bow.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ CharactersRed, wasn't as unlikeable as I thought she was going to be. Usually I dislike a YA FMC, but she wasn't 'perfect'. She makes mistakes. She felt like a genuine person, and I could feel her emotions. I liked her gut instincts. A problem solving brain, muddled with a sliver of trauma. Sounds relatable to me. Her weird thing with the curtains - I don't know man. If that bothers you, it bothers you.Oliver- I didn't like him from the beginning - because he was a written to be unlikeable. He's the 'alpha' in this group, and he gave off very - the eyebrows guy from The Maze Runner.Maddy- We love a girl's girl. That's all I can say on her. I doubted her because she comes across very shy and sheepish.Arthur- Youuuuu little minx. Lots of girls will love him. His whole personality is his moral compass, and you will either love that or hate it.Simon- Our comedic relief. He genuinely made me chuckle, I highlighted quotes that I would hear come out of my friends mouth.Reyna- I liked her the most. Weirdly, she's the cool, calm and collected one. Pre-med, I think she'll make a great doctor some day. Let's justditch the infidelity and I have a bad feeling she voted yes.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ World/Setting:I mean the RV was described in great detail. I feel like I could imagine the bullet shots and them making a make shift sort of fort. I just didn't love the world so much, it was a little ordinary for me, it wasn't as creepy as other thrillers but I think that's made up for in the plot/pacing.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ PacingI was glued to this book. I could not put it down. The pacing was action from the start, continuously - I was genuinely amazed at how well this was nailed because usually I am never satisfied with pacing.˚₊· ͟͟͞͞➳❥ EnjoymentI loved how everything came together so well. I think I've praised this book enough to understand how much I enjoyed this. 3 hours?

yes (i’d be lying if i said it wasn’t) but it was not that surprising given the fact that i guessed part of it. as for the ending; i don’t know exactly what i was expecting, but it was definitely notthat. all i can say is that it left much to be desired. it wasn’t awful, but it wasn’t good either. a mediocre ending to say the least.as for the characters, i don’t have a lot to say about them since i didn’t like any of them so i’ll be quick.starting with the main character,Red; i found her dull for the majority of the book, and at times she was irritating. i didn’t enjoy reading her inner monologues at all, they were too monotonous and long for no reason. also, she was constantly mentioning her mother and i don’t know if i’m too insensitive (perhaps i am) but i actually didn’t care about that. look, i’m sorry her mom died, i really am, but she was always bringing it up at every chapter and it was too repetitive. i think that’s why it was hard to sympathize with her. i can see why the author thought that showing her trauma was important — however, it was not necessary to mention itall. the. time.like, girl, we get it, your mom is dead!dear lord. i was tired of reading about that.Arthur, Simon, ReynaandMaddywere just... there? they weren’t awful, they were unremarkable. to me, none of them had interesting personalities that stood out. insignificant characters.nowOliver... hated him with all my heart. he won the award for the most annoying character in this book. i wanted to throw my kindle away every time he appeared (which was a bunch of times). i’m still trying to understand why the other characters just accepted him as the leader and followed his stupid orders without even thinking twice. that was so pathetic. i got mad at them for not standing up for themselves and i got mad at him too for being so bossy and infuriating. the positive thing is that at least he made me feel something — hatred? yeah. but hey! it’s still something! — and the rest of the characters failed at it since they were all a bunch of tedious people.i’m glad Oliver got what he deserved at the ending by the way. if someone asked me what was my favorite moment i would say that it was when he died.all in all,Five Survivewas a big letdown. to state the obvious: Holly Jackson is a wonderful and talented writer,but this was definitely not her best work. i’m still very excited to read her next book coming out next year, though. hopefully it will be better than this one.and huge thanks toRorofor buddy reading with me. 🥹 sadly, we didn’t love the book, but sharing theories and thoughts was super fun! excited to do another buddy read with you in the near future bestie. 🫶🏼───────────pre-review:starting this one because i haven’t read a thriller book in awhile and i feel like reading something different will help me with my slump 🤧buddy read with my sweetRoro🤍'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': '•••´º´•» 𝐟𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐬𝐮𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐯𝐞 «•´º´•••{ 2 🌟 }{page count: 388}{age rating: 14+}ೃ⁀➷ 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒐𝒓 𝒔𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒍𝒆𝒓𝒔! *ೃ༄*edit: lowering this bc everyday i think about how much i hate it. and i added more thoughts to my review ��~🚐 personally emailing Holly Jackson to get the answers i deserve 🧍\u200d♀️~the writing~ 🚐╰┈➤ while this was entertaining at times, it also dragged at certain points. i feel like they weren’t as scared out of their minds as someone should be 😭 they would be so chill sometimes and then get scared but it never lasted long. it didn’t make me have goosebumps or anything like that. the setting was in the RV the whole time. this is probably another reason why I found this somewhat boring. i wanted to binge this in at least 24 hours but that unfortunately didn’t happen 😭 i think i had such high hopes for this bc I was comparing it to AGGGTM and it just didn’t live up ☹️ also the pov was kinda confusing 😭 will be reading more Holly Jackson tho!

I was fully invested, if I had more time on my hands it would've been the perfect book to binge read in a day. Once one gets into it, there's no putting it down. You would want to theorize, to find out what really unfolded, the motives and who is the betrayer.I saw a lot of reviews stating that the start is slow, that wasn't the case for me. From the first page to the last page, it was of aconsistent pace.I did not struggle at all getting into the story. Theplot twistswere absolutely amazing, and unpredictable. I loved how it continued to surprise me right up till the end.The complexities came with thecharacters-1. Red-Such a complex character, there's depth to her. I liked how consistent she was with herself, but I would have liked her more had she been a bit more outspoken instead of a pushover.2. Simon-Honestly, he was the best of them. The humor he brought to the story was so easy to like. He was balanced, never overdoing anything and keeps the reader sane.3. Arthur-I went from like to dislike then to feeling bad for him. His morally grey character is a bit disturbing but his chemistry with Red is worth exploring.4. Reyna-Yeah no. Wasn't a fan. She's forgettable. Her sob story had no effect on me, I don't like cheaters.5. Maddy-She was there too. Pretty dumb tbh and she annoyed me at times.6. Oliver-Oof, he's the most complex characters of all in my opinion. I hated him. But at the same time I appreciated how the author wrote him. Let me explain, you think you know someone all your life but things happen, life threatening ones, and the person you knew is no longer there and instead an absolute stranger and a selfish guy is in front of you. I liked how real and truly disturbing Oliver was. He is the typical Mr Know It All guy who can't do shit. Anyway, what am saying is that it's his crap that made other characters interesting and brought more life to the book as a whole. Tho, I hope I never meet someone like him in reality 👀😅I wish the sniper could've been a little more attention but it's all good, the story was quite entertaining and the twists and turns make up for it.This was my first Holly Jackson book and it did not disappoint.

I DID NOT EXPECT THAT!This book was such an intense, emotional ride with lots of twists and turns. While reading, I thought I had figured out the mystery, but Holly completely proved me wrong in the end. The thrill and suspense were great; it’s fast-paced and very intriguing. However, I felt something was missing for me, or maybe it just got a bit boring in the middle. But overall, it was totally worth it for a quick mystery thriller read.The entire plot takes place over the span of just eight hours. Are you kidding me? Who writes a murder thriller spanning only eight hours, filled with so many twists and turns. This book is indeed a page-turner, with cliffhangers at the end of every chapter, making it really hard to put down. It’s written in third-person POV with less narration and more dialogue, which made it a very easy read.The story is about a group of teenage kids, one of whom has a secret that might be the reason the snipers are trying to kill them. I didn’t expect this book to be so emotional in the end; I thought it would just be another thriller mystery. But there I was, crying at the end because, seriously, Holly Jackson, WHAT WAS THAT ENDING? It was AMAZING. The story, the plot, the ending, the secrets, the characters, the mystery—everything was incredible. Although the ending was amazing, it was an open ending. But I think I know what Red would do now. Maybe?All the characters were well-written, which I thought wouldn’t be possible, given the eight-hour plot.Redford Kenny, orRed—her story had me bawling. She deserves so much better. She deserves everything. That scene between Red and her mother was so beautifully written, and I was just crying and crying while reading that part. I likedSimontoo; he was kinda funny. I really wanted more ofArthur, but I guess we can't. His character intrigued me a lot, but I still don’t like him for what he did.I really wanted to kill Oliver.He was so annoying, but at least he got the ending he deserved.Five Surviveis the perfect book for anyone in the mood for a quick thriller and mystery read. It’s so good. I didn’t expect to like it this much, but it really proved me wrong. I can’t wait to read more of Holly Jackson’s books in future.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""**3.5-stars rounded up**Five Surviveis the latest release from beloved author, Holly Jackson, well known for her hugely-successfulA Good Girl's Guide to Murderseries.WhileFive Survivehas a completely different feel thanAGGG, it still showcases Jackson's fluid and engaging writing style. This story is a YA-Action Thriller that takes place over the course of a single night.It's Spring Break and 18-year old, Red, and her five friends, Maddy, Oliver, Reyna, Arthur and Simon, are traveling from Pennsylvania to the Gulf Coast of Florida in an RV.You can tell from the start that Red is recovering from a trauma that has happened in her life. Since she can't afford to fly anywhere for break, her best friend, Maddy, actually suggests the RV trip. Good-naturedly, everyone else agrees.It will be fun. It'll be a real adventure.And you know, it does start out that way. People are in good spirits. They're excited for the trip to get underway, but then they get lost.It sucks getting lost in a 31-foot vehicle. It's not always easy to navigate smaller roads, let alone turn around. When your tires are shot out, it gets especially challenging.That's right. There's a sniper out there lurking in the dark and they have their sights set on our six friends, who are now trapped in their disabled vehicle. There's no cell service. They're far from help. What can they do?Once they begin communicating with the individual holding them hostage, it becomes clear, this person knows them. How did they end up here? Was this entire thing planned? This can't be a coincidence.Things become chaotic. The mood is panic, as you would expect. The sniper claims one of them has a secret that can save them all, but who!?As the tension climbs, the people inside the RV begin turning on each other. Will they all be able to make it out of this alive, or will only five survive?I liked this one. I really had no expectations going in, Action stories can be hit or miss for me. I personally felt this was a compelling, though very-OTT, Action Thriller.I seem to be stumbling across quite a few of these lately and this one was pretty fun in comparison to some others. At times I was rolling my eyes, but at other times I was absolutely glued to the pages.The audiobook was super solid. It kept me going, wanting to know the answers. There were a lot of reveals I wasn't expecting and some super unlikable characters, which are always fun for me.Yeah, I don't know. I don't know how long this one will reside in my brain, but it was a good time. A solid weekend read. Super quick, highly improbable circumstances, but engaging nonetheless.I definitely recommend this to YA Readers who enjoy tense, claustrophobic Action Thrillers. I will certainly continue to pick up anything Holly Jackson writes!""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""rereadIt happened again. I started this book, took like a day and didn't read it, then read like over 300 pages in the span of a couple of hours because it's so addicting.I read it at night again and thankfully I remembered most of what was going to happen or else I would've been so scared again.<><><><><><><>“What if I said you were the right people, in the right place at exactly the right time.”Geez, this book was a whole whirlwind. I hadn't expected to like it as much as I did because it started off rough: I hated Red because she was annoying me to no end and the plot was so confusing, but once they actually got stranded, things definitely began to take off.I'm an extreme scaredy-cat when it comes to anything crime or anything that could possibly happen in real life, but I ended up reading this late into the night and I was honestly scared to go to sleep because I have extremely irrational fears.But, this book is the definition of insane.The PlotAs I said above, I have extremely irrational fears, so I was freaking out throughout the entire book, because I was so paranoid both for myself and the characters. I honestly got so freaked out one time that my eyes teared up, which never happens to me, no matter how scared I am while reading.The plot twists were actually good- I heard people say that they found the book predictable, but I only guessed one thing right, though it was something really big:Arthur being the mole. I knew it from the very beginning, there was just something way off about him.I also am unsure how I feel about that ending, with the letter and all, considering how I feel about those characters. But the ending before that- oh my god, I almost started to cry in public, it was crazy.I also loved how fast paced this is, because I really wanted a book that was fast and quick, which this was, though it was a little confusing at times, like with some of the plot twists I had to really think about what was happening.The CharactersI didn't particularly care about the characters that much, which was a little disappointing.Red annoyed me from the start, she came off as a little crazy, but I do feel bad for her, because she seems to have gone through so much, and I honestly feel bad for disliking her but I can't help it. She made extremely dumb decisions that had me staring at my book in shock, but at least she was an interesting character with depth, which is better than a cardboard cutout character.Maddy and Simon were probably my favorites, I just liked them both a lot. Simon more so than Maddy, because I feel he had more personality and he made me laugh multiple times. Reyna used to be one of my favorites because she seemed nice and fun but then some things were revealed and let's just say, she isn't one of my favorites anymore.Oliver is a complete psychopath, and I'm sure that he was acting out of fear, but still, that was crazy, and so is he.Arthur was eh. I didn't really see much personality in him, but he was kind to Red, which was nice to see.The Friendships/RomanceI liked how complex the relationships in this were, between all of the characters. Reyna and Oliver's relationship sure was interesting, I liked Maddy and Oliver's sibling relationship, though that got a little screwed up, and I also liked Red and Maddy's friendship.There wasn't really a romance much in this, but thankfully, I didn't hate it when it was presented, I just felt indifferent towards it. Pip and Ravi are still, and always will be, my favorite couple in a murder mystery/thriller book because as I've said before, I HATE romance in mystery books, but I'm just glad that this wasn't the main focus in this, though that ending letter sure was....interesting.But anyways, I'm glad I read this!! It was a fun read that gave me multiple thrills and freaked me out way too many times, and I loved it!!4.5 stars<><><><><><><>oh my god. this was so good, actually. i was terrified the entire time and i guessed like one thing but the other stuff i was so shocked byrtc""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'oliver had it coming.thats it, thats my review----------i gasped so loudly while reading the ending my entire family looked so concerned 💀💀😭Rtci think------~~~~-----its been so long since ive read a proper mystery/thriller, lesgoooo'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'oh god. i need to um. process this.'}, {'rating': 2, 'content': 'Welp.This one will be tough to review without spoilers due to the nature of the story, so I’ll keep it brief and vague. As someone who, overall, loved the Good Girl’s Guide to Murder trilogy, I must say I’m shocked that this one didn’t work in my favor as well. There’s definitely a lack of character development inFive Survivecompared to the author’s previous trilogy, which could be due to the fact that this is a standalone novel, but I had trouble keeping each person separated as they all sounded exactly the same.The resolution of the entire mystery is over the top and wild, which isn’t a deal breaker for me, but here it felt as if the author was attempting to reach a more adult audience while writing a YA novel, and it just clashed. Everything but the kitchen sink is thrown in, and I just kept asking myself why all of this happened this way and what the point was, because it didn’t click. Perhaps it’s just me, and if so I hope this is a more enjoyable read for everyone else.

Unfortunately, the only word I can think of to describe this book is...bad. Likereally bad. The book makes almost no sense. Six teenagers take off for a week in Florida for high school spring break (do high school students do that??), make a wrong turn and find themselves trapped overnight on an old road as a sniper holds them hostage to try to get one of them to tell an important secret. That\'s the plot.The characters are almost entirely without personality including the protagonist. The secondary characters are interchangeable with the exception of one being so awful that I kept hoping the rest of the characters would toss him out of the RV just so we didn\'t have to hear from him again.Now let\'s talk about the completely nonsensical parts of the bookThe plot literally makes no sense. It\'s inexplicable why Maddy\'s and Oliver\'s mom would pick a teenage girl to set up as a fake witness to a crime--especially one she\'s known her entire life. Lavoy isn\'t featured enough to really get a sense of why she\'d execute her best friend in cold blood. The advancing her career doesn\'t have any real logic to it. Red isn\'t well enough developed to have that plot point make sense. She\'s not even attending college, so the promise of $20,000 seems to come out of nowhere. It\'s also super weird that Jackson names the mafia family Gotti, after the most famous New York crime boss, when the characters are from Philadelphia, which has its own notorious crime families. It\'s a such a strange choice that adds to have nonsensical the book feels. And the ending! Is the moral of the story seems to be ""go off with the teenager who assassinates someone to get revenge for you. It\'s romantic."" Are we really supposed to buy into that being a good ending for the character? It\'s clear from the third GGGTM, Jackson seems to love the idea that teenagers can pull off the perfect murder, but it\'s just baffling.Thanks NetGalley for the ARC of this book.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'ANOTHER HOLLY JACKSON BOOK??

Regardless of how fast paced it was, it did however feel a little slow in some parts, leaving me to skim read over the descriptions of items like a mirror. I liked how it developed, I liked the ending and plot twists. I guessed 2 of them, which I was proud of myself for, however I did not see all the others coming!!just be prepared to hate oliver. no spoilers in the sense of whether he is involved with being the actual perp in this book, he\'s just a terrible, terrible person from the first time he opens his big fat mouth.anyways, SPOILER SECTIONNNNokay i HATEDDDDDDDDDDDDDD OLIVER WITH SUCH A PASSION. it\'s been a hot second since I hated a character as much as him. I swear i clapped when that sorry excuse of a man died. he was the worst. He was he main villain when he thought he was the main character. I liked Arthur wayyyy more and we know what he did.Speaking of Arthur, I am confused on how to feel about him. He did some messed up stuff, but when dealing with the mafia, he seems like he didn\'t have much of a choice. Not justifying what he did, but i still kind of liked him. he was sweet to ren and he helped her learn the truth. he seemed to care about her beyond the mafia stuff- he didn\'t have to do some of the things he did to ""gain her trust"". or it could be i HATE oliver so much everyone else looks amazing. what happened in that RV was awful. it shouldn\'t of happened. but of it didn\'t- it leaves you wondering whether the truth would\'ve REALLY come out. i hope ren meets him at the pier. i hope she SLAPS him, and then i hope she kisses him. maybe i have been reading too many mafia wattpads... idkreyna slayed, i felt bad for her the whole book. maddy i was unsure how to feel about- but in the end i guesss she was a good friend?? she was awful when oliver was around though. i think oliver brought out the worst in people. simon felt like he was in the book JUST enough to be considered a ""main character""... i think homeboy deserved better tbh.anywayyyssssss, i hope you enjoyed reading this book like i did!! thank you for reading this long jumbled review hahhah'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'like i know we weren’t supposed to like oliver, but 🖕🏼oliver3.5'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'ahhhh idk it was good but felt unnecessarily long?? like all of the same stuff could have happened but just quicker??the twists were clever but also felt less realistic than agggtm and therefore less satisfyingi don’t believe that they wouldn’t have stood up to oliver sooner, he’s a twati’m also not sure they would’ve kept that secret at the end about who shot who..personally it just dragged a bit but it won’t stop me from trying any more books she writes'}]"

I read Animal Farm too young to identify the individual animals with actual characters on the stage of communism (the old boar Major is Marx, Farmer Jones is the Tsar, the pigs Napoleon and Snowball, Stalin and Trotsky respectively) so this essay is giving me a lot to think about. So far, nothing more so than this quote (below).(Background to the quote): A group of Ukrainian and Polish refugees in a displaced persons\' camp had discovered sympathetic parallels with their own plight in Orwell\'s parable and had begged him for permission to translate his almost-totally unknown book. But...The emotions of the American military authorities in Europe were not so easily touched. They rounded up all the copies of Animal Farm they could find and turned them over to the Red Army to be burned. The alliance between the farmers and the pigs so hauntingly described in the final pages of the novel were still in force.The book is banned in Cuba, North Korea, Burma, Iran, Kenya and most Arab countries. It is banned in the UAE not because of it\'s content but because it has anthropomorphic talking pigs which are unIslamic (is this not Orwellian in itself?). It is still censored in Vietnam.

Notes and annotations for the books made by users on their devices were also deleted. After the move prompted outcry and comparisons to Nineteen Eighty-Four itself, Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener stated that the company is ""changing our systems so that in the future we will not remove books from customers\' devices in these circumstances.""

As I found, out of the class of 24, about 20 of them had already read the book, and at least one kid knew it was an allegory of the Russian Revolution. Still, my lesson wasn\'t totally redundant :)For anyone who isn\'t familiar with the story,Animal Farmis about the animals on a farm in England rising up against the incompetent, cruel farmer (Mr Jones, who represents the deposed Tsar, Nicholas II) and taking over the farm, renaming it Animal Farm (USSR) and - so the glorious vision intended - running it for themselves, so their lives would be better.The vision is given to them by a pig, Old Major, who dies not long afterwards. Old Major probably represents Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx, and it\'s not the socialist ideal put forward that is critiqued by this book but how that vision is corrupted by certain other characters, namely another pig called Napoleon, who represents Joseph Stalin. Napoleon chases a pig called Snowball (Leon Trotsky) off the farm with his personally trained dogs (while still just the General Secretary of the Party, Stalin recruited people who would follow him blindly, so that when Lenin died in 1924 he was able to defeat Trotsky for the leadership position and his ""dogs"" kept everyone else in line).The pigs then take charge, and with their literacy skills keep changing the rules the animals established in order to suit themselves, using a pig called Squealer to convince the other animals that their memories are faulty. After all, as the drafthorse Boxer keeps saying, ""Comrade Napoleon is always right"".Boxer is - for me - the most heartbreaking character in the novel. He represents the peasants, and is the most hardworking animal on the farm. He has utter faith in the leadership of Napoleon and works himself to the bone - literally. His reward is very telling, though I don\'t want to give it away. Most of the characters represent either a person, several people or groups of people, and for the complete list you can check it out on Wikipedia.Orwell, while a socialist, was very cynical about Stalin\'s communist USSR - and for good reason!Animal Farmis a very well-written critique of how socialist ideals are corrupted by powerful people, how the uneducated masses are taken advantage of, and how the dictator or communist leaders turn into capitalists (just look at China).

The author beautifully portrays the way a revolution is started to stop what is happening and going full circle comes to the same point it started from. Just the face of power is changed.This book tells how the ruling class makes fool of the working class, uses their energies and resources for their own pleasure. What happens behind the closed doors of power.How the working class is being brain washed that they are happy and satisfied and free despite of the obvious slavery they have been undergoing.My favorite character was Benjamin (yes, a donkey) , who remains a neutral throughout and says nothing despite understanding everything.A huge applause to Orwell for being able to explain human psyche, political and social dilemma wrapped in the form of this story.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'A perfect book.

But self-sufficiency and self-government carries heavy burdens, with small and big responsibilities for each animal; and soon small frictions begin to arise in the new haven.Another all time-classic by the legendary Orwell. No half stars deducted this time. This was a flawless 5-star masterpiece, if not six; because achieving SO much in SO few pages, is beyond reckoning. A timeless allegorical novella so powerful that it’s certain to give you pause, and most likely remember it for the rest of your life. So crucial for the time it was written, and still more than relevant today, and for the future yet to come.I remember being so wowed at the time I read this, my messed up country bearing so much resemblance to the events depicted in this book. It’s similarity still strong today, and not likely to change anytime soon. It’s a sad truth that some third world countries never managed to grow beyond their petty differences and troubled beginnings.I SO wanted to know more regarding the future of the farm; but I understand why and how it ended the way it did. Such an unforgettable thought provoking story, with lovable and hateful characters(Snowball, Napoleon), and so heartbreaking.the pain in my soul for Boxer still raw and unhealed.A must read in life. Extremely Recommendable.*** Animal Farm (1954) is the best adaptation I’ve seen so far, kinda old school by today standards but still an excellent cartoonish representation. Acceptable atmosphere, adequate pacing, and more than reasonably faithful to the book, if not completely. Yet, for some reason I couldn’t nearly enjoy it as much as the book, but can’t exactly pinpoint why; maybe the surprise was lost. A good film, just not great, for me.*** Animal Farm (1999) is a somewhat controversial adaptation. Acceptable as a whole but far less faithful to the book, especially regarding the ending. A stellar voice casting including stars like Stewart, Louis-Dreyfus and Grammer, among others. The anthropomorphic representation with live animals giving it a certain unique touch the animated film didn’t have.I think either of the two films is worth watching, the first one for its grim fidelity and the second one for its more upbeat tone.

Nace una idea revolucionaria: Los Animales se gobernarán a sí mismos. Juntos darán inicio a una nueva era, donde todos los animales sean iguales. Pero la autosuficiencia y el autogobierno plantea difíciles tareas, con pequeñas y grandes responsabilidades para cada animal; y pronto algunas fisuras empiezan a aparecer en el nuevo reino.Otro clásico de todos los tiempos por el legendario Orwell. Ninguna media estrella deducida esta vez. Esta fue una impecable obra maestra de 5-estrellas, sino de seis; porque alcanzar TANTO en TAN pocas páginas, es más allá de inimaginable. Una atemporal novela corta alegórica tan poderosa que es certero que te va a producir un quiebre, y más que seguro para recordar por el resto de tu vida. Tan crucial para la época en que fue escrita, y todavía más que relevante para los tiempos actuales, y el futuro todavía por llegar.Recuerdo haberme maravillado tanto el día que leí esto, mi tan desgraciado país teniendo tremendo parecido con los eventos reflejados en este libro. Su similitud todavía patente el día de hoy, y difícilmente sujeto a cambiar pronto. Es una triste verdad que algunos países del tercer mundo nunca lograron crecer más allá de sus mezquinas diferencias y problemáticos comienzos.Realmente deseaba TANTO conocer más acerca del futuro de la granja; pero entiendo por qué y cómo terminó como lo hizo. Una historia tan inolvidable y provocadora, con entrañables y odiosos personajes(Bola de Nieve, Napoleón), y tan devastadora.el dolor de mi alma por Boxer todavía fresco y sin curar.Una obligación de leer en la vida. Extremadamente Recomendable.*** Rebelión en la Granja (1954) es la mejor adaptación que vi hasta ahora, un poco antigua para los estándares de hoy pero aun así una excelente representación animada. Atmósfera aceptable, ritmo adecuado, y más que razonablemente fiel al libro, sino completamente. Aun así, por alguna razón no lo pude disfrutar ni de cerca tanto como el libro, pero no podría precisar exactamente por qué; tal vez se perdió la sorpresa. Un buen filme, sólo que no genial, para mí.*** Rebelión en la Granja (1999) es una algo controversial adaptación. Aceptable en su conjunto, pero mucho menos fiel al libro, especialmente con respecto al final. Un electo estelar de voces incluyendo estrellas como Stewart, Louis-Dreyfus y Grammer, entre otros. La representación antropomórfica con animales reales dándole un cierto toque único que película animada no tiene.Creo vale la pena ver cualquiera de los dos filmes, el primero por su sombría fidelidad y el segundo por tu tono más alegre. Aunque si tuviera que elegir, creo que la versión de 1954 dentro de todo me pareció mejor, y más memorable.-----------------------------------------------NOTA PERSONAL:[1945] [128p] [Clásicos] [Extremadamente Recomendable] [“Todos los animales son iguales.”] [""Cuatro patas bien, dos patas mal.""]-----------------------------------------------'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '(book 564 From 1001 Books) - Animal Farm, George OrwellAnimal Farmis an allegorical novella by George Orwell, first published in England on 17 August 1945.According to Orwell, the book reflects events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and then on into the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union.Orwell, a democratic socialist, was a critic of Joseph Stalin and hostile to Moscow-directed Stalinism, an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the Spanish Civil War.The Soviet Union, he believed, had become a brutal dictatorship, built upon a cult of personality and enforced by a reign of terror.Old Major, the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as ""enemies"" and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called ""Beasts of England"".When Major dies, two young pigs, Snowball and Napoleon, assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer Mr. Jones from the farm, renaming it ""Animal Farm"".They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, ""All animals are equal.""Snowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of Animalism. Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly.The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.Some time later, several men attack Animal Farm.Jones and his men are making an attempt to recapture the farm, aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts. Snowball and the animals, who are hiding in ambush, defeat the men by launching a surprise attack as soon as they enter the farmyard. Snowball\'s popularity soars, and this event is proclaimed ""The Battle of the Cowshed"".It is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun, on the anniversary of the Revolution. Napoleon and Snowball vie for pre-eminence. When Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a windmill, Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader. ...عنوانها: قلعه (مزرعه) حیوانات - نویسنده: جورج اورول؛ (جامی،...) ادبیات انگلستان؛ تاریخ نخستین خوانش متن نسخه انگلیسی: در سال 1975میلادیمترجمها: بدون هیچ ترتیبی آنهایی را که یافتم چل و چهار نامدار را بنگاشتم؛ گویا باید در رکوردهای گینس ثبت شودمترجم 01 -

It is a deceptively simple tale, which even older children could read. About an animal uprising, it is written in the style of a fable, and yet it can be read on so many levels. It is clearly both a satire and an allegory, a dystopian tale, and its author George Orwell made no secret of what regime, and which politicians, he was so mercilessly parodying. Yet as with all great novels, it speaks to us today and holds many timeless truths. It is the sort of novel where a reader will find new depths in each rereading.The inspiration for the novel came from a real-life episode. Orwell had just left the BBC, in 1943, and was uneasy about some propaganda he could see distributed by the then ""Ministry of Information"". He says,""I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.""George Orwell wroteAnimal Farmbetween November 1943 and February 1944, but the novel was not published straightaway, because of the USSR\'s status as an ally in the Second World War. George Orwell was a socialist writer, so the fact that he chose to do such a savage critique of the Soviet Union may come as a bit of a surprise to a present-day reader. One might have expected him to choose the far right, rather than the far left. But he personally felt that the Soviet Union (now Russia) of that time had itself become a brutal dictatorship, and that its original ideals had become perverted.Animal Farmwas subsequently published in England in 1945, just after the war, and ironically it quickly became a great commercial success when it did finally appear, partly because the Cold War so quickly followed the Second World War. However the book was immediately banned in the USSR and other communist countries. To this day it is still banned or censored in some places; the United Arab Emirates, Cuba, North Korea - and China, until almost the beginning of the 21st century.In his story George Orwell chronicles the rising to power of Joseph Stalin, who is depicted by the pig""Napoleon""in the novel. The story parallels his emergence as a natural leader, and gradually follows his rise to power as a dictator. Near the beginning of the novel, the farm animals overthrow their oppressor, the farmer""Mr Jones"". This is a direct analogy to the Bolshevik Revolution of October 1917, when the Russian Tsar Nicholas II, who had abdicated in February, was executed by the Bolsheviks along with the rest of his family, in July 1918. Interestingly, Orwell said the drunken farmer Jones, who neglects his animals, was based on the real life Tsar Nicholas II.But their democratic coalition of animals, all with a vision of independence, comfort and freedom from constraints, is gradually broken down. There is straightaway a consolidation of power among the pigs, who do no work because they are the""brainworkers""with what is tacitly agreed as superior intelligence. Just as the Soviet intelligentsia did, the pigs establish themselves as the ruling class in the new ""free"" society. InAnimal Farmthey then immediately begin to manipulate and control the new state for their own benefit.At the start of the novel,""Major""a middle white boar, has a dream, which he relates to all the animals, in a lengthy impassioned speech. It is a dream of the future, and of freedom for all creatures. It captures their imaginations, and inspires their actions from then on. Major is based on a combination of Karl Marx and Vladimir Lenin. Just as Lenin\'s embalmed body was put on display for the people,Major\'s skull is initially mounted as an emblem for the animals to revere, although by the end this is removed, and the animals are expected to worship Napoleon.Major\'s principles provide the foundation for the code of the revolution and the philosophy of""Animalism"".The other main character at the start of the novel is the pig,""Snowball""who is based on Leon Trotsky. Just as in the Soviet Union, these two characters vie for power, with""Napoleon""using subterfuge and manipulation to his own ends. He arranges false confessions, show trials and executions to enforce his power, frequently changing history as the story unfolds.""Squealer""is a pig who works on behalf of Napoleon, employing various devious means to misrepresent and confuse the animals. He is apparently based on Molotov. Squealer speechifies, using elaborate philosophical ideas which the animals cannot really follow, often using the Socratic dialogue to get the answer he desires. And this is always used to justify the pigs\' greedy and unprincipled behaviour; anything which is self-serving and goes against the original ideas of fairness. George Orwell is keen to show the corruption of""Animalist""ideals by those in power, not that the ideals themselves were wrongly held. In 1947, George Orwell wrote,""For the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement ... I thought of exposing the Soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.""For instance, Squealer works on the animals so that they accept a slogan which is almost the direct opposite of its original,""Four legs good, two legs bad""becomes""Four legs good, two legs better""overnight, as bleated by the impressionable, keen to follow, sheep. The reason for this is clear from the story. And""Snowball""(based on Trotsky) isthus expelled from the revolutionary stateby a malicious comrade eager to dominate, using any violent means available to achieve his ends. Nobody knows who they can trust any more.The irony is at its highest in the depiction of corruption; the tyranny and hypocrisy of the pigs as led by Napoleon. The food rations get increasingly smaller, yet it is ""proved"" to them that they are all much better off than they were formerly under Farmer Jones. The animals\' ideology of liberation and equality gradually disintegrates. The rules change secretly, slowly and silently, so nobody is sure what is really the truth any longer. History is rewritten; memories become unreliable; the brainwashing is slow and subtle. The animals can read, but there is little documentation, except for seven commandments, painted on the barn wall,1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.3. No animal shall wear clothes.4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.5. No animal shall drink alcohol.6. No animal shall kill any other animal.7. All animals are equal.Yet over time, each of these is amended, to the advantage of the pigs, until in the end there are no words showing at all, and the final famously nonsensical maxim is spouted without question,""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.""The rousing song""Beasts of England"", which all the animal took as their National Anthem at the beginning of the story, is banned. The symbol depicting the horn and hoof, on their green flag, which indicated their Animalism philosophy and power, is obliterated. (This was similar in real life to the hammer and sickle on the Soviet flag.)The novel is a dual critique against the Stalinist regime of violence, but also against the imposed rhetoric, against the language employed, logic and ideals.Another character indicated by George Orwell is his depiction of Adolf Hitler, as one of the farmers,""Mr Frederick"", who wants to take over the renamed""Animal Farm"". But there are many minor characters whom we all recognise in our own lives. Take the cat, who votes for both sides at the same time. Who has never come across a ""two-faced"" person? Or the pony""Mollie"", the stereotypically vain and lazy original Essex girl, with her penchant for wearing ribbons in her hair and looking at herself in a mirror, regardless of any greater good which may come about by a little hard work. The story of the carthorse""Boxer""will break your heart. His courage, his steadfastness; with his personal motto,""I will work harder!""he is the archetypal salt of the earth. But he is naïve and gullible, and the reader fears that he will be taken advantage of to a devastating conclusion. You will cry, internally at least, but you will also laugh with this book. Here is an extract from the pompous poet pig, Minimus\'s, eulogy about Napoleon.""Friend of the fatherless!Fountain of happiness!Lord of the swill-bucket!""The conclusion of the book is predictable, but perhaps not in quite the simple way the reader expects. Yes, the oppressees become the oppressors, but in a fiendishly clever denouement.All the political manipulations of the novel are recognisable today. Wherever you live, you will not have to look very close from home to find such a regime. And also, the brilliance of this novel is that those characteristics of scheming, dishonesty, cynicism, and underhanded ways of achieving a particular end, are not confined to politics. Who has never watched a skilled manipulator diverting attention from one major problem by concentrating on a minor one? It may have been in politics - or it may have been in a committee meeting - or even, dare it be said, around your own dinner table. Large or small scale, these observations by George Orwell are, sadly, truths about the human condition and human behaviour. They are timeless, and present in any institution, cooperation, business, family - in fact any group of people. One critic has even suggested that Orwell has put himself in the novels as Benjamin, the donkey, a wise old creature who is the only one who pessimistically repeats,""Life will go on as it has always gone on - that is, badly.""Have you actually readAnimal Farm?

After around page twenty it was very obvious how this book would end. History repeats itself and in this case it goes full circle. Nothing changes. And a wise old Donkey was the only one in the piece aware of this. We can presume he has seen it before, though, on a character level he was a bit of an ass not to tell anybody what was coming. See what I did there? I’m good. I know.The problem I had withAnimal Farmis that I could not engage with it. The characters aren’t really characters. The setting isn’t really a setting. And the plot isn’t really a plot. They are all mere devices, a means for Orwell to blurt out his political statement. The entire book is one big author filibuster, an entire situation and a group of characters created for the simple reason of showing Orwell’s opposition to communism and, more specifically, the Stalin regime. It’s cleverly written, and it is funny at times, but such direct authorial intention took something away from the reading experience. I couldn’t lose myself within the writing.The pigs were used as an insult to mankind. Their leader Napoleon (aptly named?) slowly distances the pigs from the animals of the revolution. They begin to take on the traits of humans, and after a few chapters they have set themselves up as the thing they originally usurped. They become corrupt and driven by money and profit. They’re above their peers, ultimately, destroying their own aims. By doing this Orwell is calling humans pigs; he is calling post-revolutionaries pigs. For me reading this, this was more of an insult to pigs than humans. Pigs are lovely animals. (Nicer than humans?) The metaphor certainly relies much on the reader’s interpretation of what a pig is.That’s me just being pedantic and silly, but I guess I just like pigs. And I feel like I’ve readAnimal Farmbefore. I feel like I know this story, and that’s because it is the history of mankind; it is the history of revolution. So, needless to say, Orwell has captured a large sense of this on the page. When it has been read, it is definitely something that cannot be unread. The allegory is pertinent and, in a sense, an almost pessimistic truism, though the inner romantic in me finds such a defeatist attitude, well, defeating.It’s undoubtedly very intelligent writing, but I just didn’t enjoy it. When I read literature, whether it be poetry, play or novel, I like imagining things; I like coming up with my own interpretation, meaning, or criticisms. With this, Orwell has said it all. I feel like I didn’t need to read it, a plot summary would have given me everything the writing did.- This is the first book I read on my2017 reading challenge, I hope I enjoy the others more!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Animal FarmbyGeorge OrwellThe animals of a farm, tired of the continuous abuses of human beings, decide to rebel.

It is emblematic of rebellion against dictators and totalitarianism!It is a story of the Farmer Jones’ animals rising up in rebellion, tired of exploitation, to take over the “Manor Farm”, to build a fairer society for themselves. There are stark similarities between politicians and animal leaders.Power and use of language for controlling minds, has been astutely demonstrated in this novel, by George Orwell. Being a short-fabled fairy-like animal entertainer, it doesn’t render itself into a boring political study for a tad!A satirical comedy on the inextricability of power and corruption, and their insidious effect on the common public! The corruption of the pigs metaphorically demonstrates the yielding of the politicians (in any age or era) for gaining power and control. The skilful use of peer pressure by pigs to keep the rest of the animals subservient, is analogous to modern-day plight of students and corporate employees!The story begins with the 12-yr old Major(boar), revealing his dream to his comrades(other animals at farm), about the future rebellion of animals against men, and teaching all a song-“Beasts Of England”.He clarifies to all –""All men are enemies. All animals are comrades.""Soon Major dies, Snowball and Napoleon, take the lead! One fine evening, the animals drive away Mr. Jones (farm owner), and rename the farm –“Animal Farm”.The 7 commandments are inscribed, on the tarred wall with great white letters-1. Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.2. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.3. No animal shall wear clothes.4. No animal shall sleep in a bed.5. No animal shall drink alcohol.6. No animal shall kill any other animal.7. All animals are equal.Since most of the animals cannot learn to read or to memorize the seven commandments, the commandments are reduced to one simple maxim: “Four legs good, two legs bad.”Mr. Jones tries to recapture the farm, but Snowball successfully defends it. Mollie, the horse, who is seen consorting with the humans, is confronted, and finally leaves the rebellion and the Farm!The humans despise the burgeoning of the Animal Farm!But things don’t remain hunky-dory, and we see the rebellion being betrayed, the farm getting dilapidated again, all under the dictatorship of one of their leaders! (avoiding spoilers)Animal Farm is a fun ride, as it teaches the intertwinement and inextricability of power and corruption in the most amusingly creative way, which remains applicable to current age and aeons to come!A fun-filled 5 stars!!'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""I suspect this is what my pets are getting up to while I’m away. ‘All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others,’ is something I’m fairly certain my dog has barked while stealing a treat from the other dog, and cats are inherently libertarians so there’s probably some horrible revolution brewing. Come to think of it, when my cat pukes on the rug it does sound vaguely like he’s saying‘the only good human being is a dead one,’ but I won’t hide the Orwell from them because there will be no censorship in this house. Anyways,Animal Farmis a classic for a reason and it is one that I found managed to hit even harder as an adult than it did when I read it for my freshman literature class. This story was used to teach us all the term allegory, as in “Orwell wroteAnimal Farmas an allegory of the Russian Revolution” as well as the term satire, as in “Orwell satirizes following political leaders into totalitarianism,” but above all it taught me how a good writer can deliver an important political message even adorned in the trappings of a barnyard tussle. While it is highly critical of the Soviets, readers shouldn't mistake it as a condemnation of socialism as Orwell was more intent on showing how those who thirst for power will hijack socialist movements and Orwell wants to protect those in order for them to flourish.Animal Farmremains a staple of western literature and classroom discussions for Orwell’s ability to be succinct and accessible while also conveying complex themes on freedom, power struggles and one of Orwell’s signature themes: propaganda.Sandra Boynton’sBarnyard Dance…Orwell styleHaving just recently read and been blown away byWatership DownfromRichard Adamswhere themes of leadership and power are examined through a story of the animal kingdom, I wanted to revisit Orwell and see how his similar allegorical packaging held up. While Adams’s tale is fairly symbolic of WWII, I think it functions really great as a general metaphor on authoritarianism and struggles for freedom whereas Orwell’sAnimal Farmis much more confined within its narrative as a take on the Soviet Union. Not that it can’t be read as a more general look at the way well-intentioned movements can be corrupted by power and those in power can propagate the people into paving their paths to power, but a lot ofAnimal Farmscharm is seeing the satirical allegory and the character references. For instance, we can see how Old Major is representative ofKarl Marxand his dream a nod to theThe Communist Manifesto, or Napoleon representingJoseph Stalin, Snowball asLeon Trotsky, and more metaphorical stand-ins such as the working class personified as Boxer. Though perhaps it is Squealer who is my favorite of the political metaphors on propaganda and rhetorical manipulations for all the books snappy slogans, but more on that in a moment,‘All men are enemies. All animals are comrades.’The opening of the story reflects the overthrow of the Czar and while Orwell is speaking out against the communist regime that took control, Orwell is often misinterpreted as being broadly anti-socialism, anti-marxism, etc. In his essayWhy I Write(you can read itHERE) he states ‘every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic socialism, as I understand it.’ Which I think adds an important nuance to this story that is often misinterpreted: it isn’t to say that the idea of all animals being equal, or the idea of organizing for a more just society are inherently bad, its that movements often get hijacked to become antithetical to what they started as and rhetoric gets twisted and turned back inwards.The irony, however, is that for all his work examining the evils of propaganda—a primary theme in1984—the bookAnimal Farmitself became weaponized as propaganda. In hisintroduction to a Ukranian edition, Orwell himself admits he wanted to use distribution of the novel as anti-Soviet rhetoric, because apparently all propaganda is equally bad but some propaganda is more equally bad than others. ‘I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the Socialist movement,’ he says, and wroteAnimal Farmin a way that ‘could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages.’ Which explains the accessibility of the novel, and while it is fairly heavy-handed it still reads quite well.The use of the novel as propaganda didn’t just end at distributions of translations, however. In his bookOrwell Subverted: The CIA and the Filming of Animal Farm,Daniel J. Leabargues thatAnimal Farmwas intended as a ‘warning against the Stalinist perversion of socialism’ and not socialism itself, though the CIA found the narrative a useful tool if they could make a few changes. Orwell’s widow was apprehensive of a film adaptation originally and then demanded they maintained the integrity of Orwell’s vision, and one might wonder if her reluctance to give access to any of Orwell’s work after that. The CIA made the anti-Soviet theme more pronounced without any nuance, such as making Snowball completely irredeemable and making a division between “good” and “bad” farmers to make a statement that not all farmers (and by proxy all capitalists) are bad.‘Can you not understand that liberty is worth more than just ribbons?’What fascinates me most in this novel is the use of language, particularly the way language can be manipulated or intentionally obfuscated in order to seduce the masses, subvert opposition and reframe reality. Language with oversimplificatiosn like ‘four legs good, two legs bad’ masks ulterior motives and becomes a sort of catch-all to smuggle a whole ideology. AsNoam Chomskywrote inMedia Control: The Spectacular Achievements of Propaganda:'That's the whole point of good propaganda. You want to create a slogan that nobody's going to be against, and everybody's going to be for. Nobody knows what it means, because it doesn't mean anything.'Squealer and Napoleon repeatedly walk back earlier statements, twisting logic as they see fit and Boxer, confused and wanting to remain loyal, is easy propagated to believe any revision. Even to history, such as Snowball’s role in the revolution. This idea is expressed in Orwell’s1984’ as well, ‘if thought corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought,’ and through Orwell we often see how language is a great tool but one that can also be weaponized for evil.‘Man is the only creature that consumes without producing. He does not give milk, he does not lay eggs, he is too weak to pull the plough, he cannot run fast enough to catch rabbits. Yet he is lord of all the animals. He sets them to work, he gives back to them the bare minimum that will prevent them from starving, and the rest he keeps for himself.’This is a quick read, and a rather fun one at that even if you aren’t reading for the Soviet allegory. It is fairly heavy handed, and intended as such, and while I think I prefer the wayWatership Downis more broadly metaphorical and emotional (also has its own lore and language), the directness and accessibility of this one also help it land a major impact upon the reader. It is no surprise this has remained a classroom staple for its ease of teachability on both literary techniques and political history but also from the way the CIA harnessed it as propaganda forever enshrining it in US culture as well as English. Though at heart it is more a warning about power and abuse of rhetoric in order to hijack movements. So watch out, your pets might be collaborating with each other and you should be wary if a meow starts to sound strangely likeVive la révolution...4.5/5‘The creatures outside looked from pig to man, and from man to pig, and from pig to man again; but already it was impossible to say which was which.’""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'يمكن لنا أن نقول أن روايتي مزرعة الحيوان وأولاد حارتناهما أعظم روايتان رمزيتان مباشرتان كتبتا في القرن الفائتفكلاهما لا يخفي من نفس المؤلف شيئاوكلاهما يعبر عن مرارة تعتلج بنفس كاتبهاوكلاهما بليغ وفصيح وممتع***وأظن سر نجاح مزرعة الحيوان المدوي هو تعديها حدود الزمان والمكانوأنها ومهما تعددت الأنظمة وتبدلت القوانين ومرت السنواتتظل خالدةلعنة أبدية تطارد المستبد في كل زمان ومكانلعنة على الخنوع والجبنلعنة تتردد على أفواه مستضعفي الأرضالذين ما إن تواتيهم الفرصةيمسكون بالكرباج ويستضعفون خلقا جديدا***أخبرهم كيف أن حياتهم قصيرة يظلون يكدحون فيها ثم فى النهاية يذبحونولا يوجد فى إنجلترا كلها حيوان حرإنهم لا يتركون لنا إلا الفتات مع أننا نقوم بكل العمل...***'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'This book is featured on Shabby Sunday @https://readrantrockandroll.com/2018/...I readAnimal Farmwhen I was in college and it was one of those reads where you think it’s going to be boring, but it turns out to be a favorite. It’s an allegorical tale representing the Russian Revolution where the characters in the book represent people during this time.I won’t go into the plot too much, but in a nutshell, this story is about a group of farm animals who rise up against the evil farmer who cares for them. They basically take over the farm by cause of Old Major (Marx/Lenen), the pig all about change. He get’s all the animals together into an uprising against Mr. Jones, the farmer (Tsar Nicholas II). The animal characters then run the farm themselves and develop their own hierarchy being lead by Snowball (Trotsky) and Napoleon (Stalin). In a way, the story reminds me of an Aesop’s Fable because the animal characters in the book have human characteristics and there are morals and messages that are quite obvious. Young readers can read it and they won’t pick up on the meaning–they’ll just think it’s a story about a group of rebellious farm animals against humans, but I believe the message that Orwell wanted to express is that power corrupts. Also that people need to think for themselves, educate yourself and make your own decisions. Don’t let others think for you.Someone recently asked me who my favorite character was in the book which is a really difficult question to ask, in my opinion. I liked a handful of the characters including Boxer, Snowball, Benjamin, and Clover, but if I had to choose a favorite, it would have to be Snowball. Snowball’s ideas were in the best interests of the animals and he was always fair. He wanted to educate the other animals and make life easier for them. He was intelligent, brave, and stood up for his beliefs which is why he’s my favorite character in the book.I’m not sure exactly how old my edition ofAnimal Farmis because no publication date is given, however, Goodreads seems to have this Signet Classic published in 1956.

Orwell was against totalitarianism, specifically Stalinism, not socialism. He was for most of his life a devoted democratic socialist, but a vocal opponent of authoritarianism.This nuanced distinction is often lost. Even in his portrayal of the evolution of the farm - from Manor Farm to Animal Farm, and beyond - he identifies many successes of collectivism and how it gives greater autonomy and purpose to the animals. He is critical of the biased communications and propaganda from totalitarian regimes and this can be seen as a cautionary tale regarding these kinds of governments.I also thought of Ursula K. LeGuin’s brilliant novel The Dispossessed. While both LeGuin’s non-authoritarian anarchism and the voluntary socialism Orwell champions may only work on paper, his warnings against impaired freedom of speech and of ideological corruption were spot on.This is also timeless, many of the lessons he imparts and observations made are as relevant now as in the 40s.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'A masterpiece !!! One of my all time favourite 📚. Its a brilliant piece of art. This is my fourth ❹ time reading it and still surprised me how George orwel articulate this magnificent allegorical novella in a very modest, straight forwardish and politic driven tale with a metaphoric fashion that merely shows the true outcome of the way revolutions took place ( from *Utopia* to *Oligarchy* ) on the face of the earth 🌍 up to now ... The book cemented the key takeaway of the story within and make me picture the well crafted plot and visualize every part of the story as if i was there in person.It is a Must Read! \'coz the novella is equiped with ever relevant lessons for all age groups.

A Little Life
",Hanya Yanagihara,4.31,747523,2874,"Fiction, Contemporary, LGBT, Literary Fiction, Queer, Mental Health, Adult",720,10-03-2015,"When four classmates from a small Massachusetts college move to New York to make their way, they're broke, adrift, and buoyed only by their friendship and ambition. There is kind, handsome Willem, an aspiring actor; JB, a quick-witted, sometimes cruel Brooklyn-born painter seeking entry to the art world; Malcolm, a frustrated architect at a prominent firm; and withdrawn, brilliant, enigmatic Jude, who serves as their center of gravity.Over the decades, their relationships deepen and darken, tinged by addiction, success, and pride. Yet their greatest challenge, each comes to realize, is Jude himself, by midlife a terrifyingly talented litigator yet an increasingly broken man, his mind and body scarred by an unspeakable childhood, and haunted by what he fears is a degree of trauma that he’ll not only be unable to overcome—but that will define his life forever.","[{'rating': 3, 'content': ""5 THINGS I LIKED ABOUTA LITTLE LIFE(AND 5 THINGS I DIDN'T)Everyone’s talking about Hanya Yanagihara’s Booker- and National Book Award-nominated blockbuster novel. There are lots of 5 star raves on this site. Many people are saying it’s one of the most incredible books they’ve ever read. I hate to be the outlier or considered cold-hearted (I’m not! I cry over books and movies ALL THE TIME!!!). The book took me just under 2 weeks to finish, and I’m glad I read it. I liked it, I really liked it! But I also didn’t. Here’s why.THINGS I LIKED1. The power of friendshipIf this book had a theme song it might be the Beatles’ “With A Little Help From My Friends.” Four roommates at an Eastern college move to the Big Apple and become huge successes: J.B. becomes a hip downtown artist; the well-off Malcolm is a well-known architect; Willem goes from waiter to movie star practically overnight; Jude is a lawyer, first at the D.A.’s office and then at a prestigious corporate firm, where he works himself up and becomes a partner.Over the decades, their friendship endures, through spats, early career struggles, J.B.’s drug addiction and, most of all, dealing with the effects of Jude’s unspeakably abusive past on his current life, although Jude is terrified to tell anyone about that abuse. The novel is also refreshing in its depiction of race, gender and sexual orientation.2. The depiction of the effects of abuseMy one major takeaway from this book is a fuller understanding of the after-effects of systemic childhood abuse. Jude, an orphan raised at a monastery, the first site of his sadistic stations of the cross, feels absolutely worthless. He cuts himself (if you’re squeamish, you’ve been warned). He bangs himself against walls. In one particularly harrowing scene, he sets himself on fire. Beyond that, he can’t trust anyone and doesn’t feel he’s worthy of love, even though as an adult he gets nothing BUT unconditional love (with one notable exception). For the people who adore him (not just J.B., Malcolm and Willem but Harold, his former law professor, who, with his wife Julia, adopt Jude at age 30, and Andy, the most supportive physician on the planet), this is beyond frustrating. A good one-third to one-half of the book recounts all of that.3. The way Jude’s brutal past is layered into the storyYanagihara expertly weaves the story of Jude’s abusive past into his present-day narrative. And in the character of Brother Luke (especially), she understands how abusers manipulate.4. J.B.’s artThe descriptions of J.B.’s art projects, from his early, experimental pieces as a student – one involves collecting people’s real hair – to the shows that get him attention and fame, all feel authentic. My only question would be the scope and range of his work. The subjects of his art all seem to be his friends. Really? He has no other interests? Or is this merely a comment on #1 (above)? [Side note: the cover photo for the North American edition is brutally powerful: it’s called Orgasmic Man, and captures the feeling of ecstatic turmoil vividly.]5. The proseObviously a book has to be decent to keep you absorbed for over 700 pages. Yanagihara knows how to string you along. Jude has problems walking – he’s vague in his description about how this happened – and once she plants the idea of Jude’s abuse, she makes you wonder what EXACTLY happened to him. And as with any coming-of-age book, you want to know where they end up.THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE (PLEASE DON’T HATE ME!)1. The total lack of historical contextCharacters use the internet and cellphones, but no world events occur. The only things that register are the friends’ cultural milestones: JB’s retrospective, Willem’s movies (which, incidentally, all have horrible, unlikely titles), Malcolm’s buildings, Jude’s cases. There’s something incredibly narcissistic about this. Seriously? Nothing on 9/11? The economic downturn didn’t affect Malcolm’s Upper East Side family? J.B. is of Haitian background; were any relatives affected by the earthquake? No one – not one friend, colleague, etc. – is dealing with HIV? (We’re told Jude’s body is riddled with disease, but never get the details.)2. The implausibilityNot only is Jude a top-notch litigator, but he’s also a brilliant mathematician. AND an excellent pianist. AND a singer of lieder. During school (full scholarship), he has a job at a bakery (oh, he’s also an amazing baker). So… when - and HOW - did he learn how to play piano and study German art songs? Seriously. I want to know. What bothers me is the assumption beneath all of this. Does he have to be so good at all of these things for people to love him? If someone has been abused and ISN’T as accomplished, isn’t this person just as worthy of love and understanding? For that matter, WHY do people love Jude? I don’t get it. All he seems to be doing for the entire book is saying, “I’m sorry.” Which brings me to...Why are these guys all friends, again? Cuz they went to the same school? We don’t get enough about their early years to know what solidifies their friendship. Yanagihara just TELLS us they are friends, and we have to accept it. For 700 pages. Which brings me to…3. The RepetitionThe book needed more serious editing. It could have lost 250 pages easily. About ⅓ of the way in, I thought, somewhat heartlessly (I know, I know), “Imagine taking a drink every time Jude says ‘I’m sorry.’” I’d love to search how many times that phrase pops up, as well as the word “shame.” Just saying. Weget it, Hanya.4. Lifestyle pornNot only do all four friends become enormous successes in their fields, but they’re constantly jetting off to exotic places (Paris for the weekend? Why not?!), buying up lofts (stylish and trendy downtown, of course, NEVER uptown) and having Malcolm decorate them in the best Architectural Digest taste. And then there’s the cultural snobbery. I howled when Willem was going to film Chekhov’sUncle Vanyaand ALL OF HIS FRIENDS KNEW THE CHARACTERS FROM THE PLAY. I’ve seenVanyaseveral times, and even I don’t know all the characters in the play.5. Black and white charactersI’m not talking about race, here. I’m talking about people who are either ALL GOOD or ALL BAD. We’re all somewhere in the middle, but not in Yanigihara’s universe. Which made me think that the book needs to be read as a fable, an urban fairy tale, not realism. Is that why there are no historic markers? Because this is some Dickensian book set in chic SoHo? I don’t know. But if these people who we spend so much time with had more shading, I’d probably have liked – and BELIEVED – it a lot more.***Final thoughts: obviously Yanagihara has tapped into something serious and profound with this book. I think people are responding to it because in some way we all feel damaged, used, unloved – although not to the extent that Jude does. Most of us learn to overcome our insecurities and move on. He's that terrified child we all carry around inside ourselves, saying we're no good, we're not attractive, we're not worthy of love. I just wish all this had been done with a bit more subtlety. Life isn't so black and white. Yanagihara should know that, as we get older, we learn to accept, and live with, fascinating shades of grey. And that if she had brought out those complex greys, the book would feel more authentic and less sentimental.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""Some believe that this is “The Great Gay Novel.” That couldn’t be more wrong. There are only two recognizable gay men in this work, JB and Caleb. A creative queen and a violent, probably psychopathic, sadist. All the other “possibilities” are pedophiles (categorically not gay—that’s a sickness, an evil, that has nothing to do with being gay) or so hopelessly confused (and impotent) that you can’t know what they are (JB and Willem). The take on gay men here is antediluvian—a dangerous and discredited brand of heteronormative delusion in which all gay men, no matter the glittering surface of their lives, are fated only to die a lonely, miserable death. Caleb dies an excruciating death (so we’re told) from pancreatic cancer. JB, the witty, flamboyant, unstable, creative queen is merely a plot point. His happiness, told but not shown, at the bitter end doesn’t mean anything more than that. He’s a device to wring one more regret from you, one more sorrow. You can be assured that he, too, will die an ignoble death just beyond this novel’s last page. And you won’t be troubled or offended or titillated by the gay sex (or really any sex) here because there isn’t any: it’s the sex that dare not speak its name. All this is because the author knows absolutely nothing about gay men other than the most superficial stereotypes and doesn’t have the imagination to venture deeper than that. She can’t even imagine that a man (Willem) doesn’t need a woman to quench his sexual needs—he has a solution readily at hand.Some people believe this is a novel about friendship. That also couldn’t be more wrong. The author warns you early on [225] that friendship is nothing but the slow drip of miseries. This book is not about friends, it is about enablers. All the main characters are there specifically to enable Jude, which is precisely what destroys him. Were they his friends, they would never have let things progress the way they did.Some people believe that a strength of this book is that the author's presence is not felt. This also couldn’t be more wrong. There is absolutely nothing here that is not the author’s presence. It is all tell and no show. The characters are cartoons. They can’t grow. They can’t surprise. All they can do is grind the meticulous plot forward. They are not here for any other purpose. They aren’t really characters at all, just cogs in a machine.Every novel demands, by necessity, some suspension of disbelief. But no novel can be unbelievable. But that’s all we’re told. Four adolescents are thrown together as suitemates at a highly prestigious Cambridge college (wink, wink) and we’re told, not shown, that they effortlessly go on to become the best, the most famous—trial lawyer, actor, artist, and architect. The actor and architect might squeak by as believable, but not the trial lawyer, not the artist. From what we’re told about the trial lawyer, it’s impossible to reconcile his catastrophic, constricted, precarious little life with the cold, predatory, expert were told he is. From what we’re told about the artist, it’s impossible to believe, even in New York City’s insular and provincial art world, that the same series of portraits from photographs of the same three men over and over and over again will raise him to the top of that art world. The artists, the real ones, the author cites are all mediocre; the one she tells surely must be likewise.Moreover, we’re told that that men, all men, have a permanent, genetic, stunted repertoire of emotion, have a tiny emotional toolbox. And that their character is fixed at some ill defined state in their past and beyond that no change can ever take place. Growth, change, redemption—all are denied. Thus, we don’t get characters, we get cartoons. Cardboard cutouts. They are here only to satisfy the deliberate plotting. They are only means to the author’s ends, nothing more.And to add to the unbelievability: the villains, puerile: the pedophiles—Catholic clergy, Dickensonian orphanage counselors, a homicidal psychiatrist, long-haul truckers, a vast nationwide network of solitary and group child predators; and, of course, the brutal, violent gay psychopath. Even granting evil is banal, this is beneath banal. Cartoon. Cardboard. What’s lacking here, and elsewhere, everywhere in this novel, is any imagination beyond just that: the banal; the puerile; the stereotype.Not to dwell on the unbelievable, but it permeates this book. Nonexistent syndromes. Nonexistent legal cases. Hyenas that climb trees. And over and over and over the doctor, Andy: he fails every duty of care, everything that physicians stand for, believe in, dedicate their lives to—he’s there only to enable. He doesn’t report what must be reported, not just legally but morally. And, of course, plot over believability, neither do any other of the medical professionals, doctors and nurses, a legion of them through whose care Jude passes. They all turn a blind eye to the evidence of his abuse, his self abuse. Andy neglects to mention the very real and virtually insoluble problem of phantom pain when he explains amputation to Jude, but then just that develops post-op, only to be brushed aside a few pages later. It doesn’t work that way. (And, really, it would have meshed perfectly with the author’s plot. Another failure of imagination?) And, fundamentally: physicians don’t treat their friends, their family. That’s a recipe for disaster. Unless disaster is precisely the aim.And I just can’t let it go: lunch at obviously Le Bernardin, Willem without a jacket. No way. No man dines there who is not wearing a jacket. And especially not an actor, no matter how famous. Here, I guess, the point where the author did let her imagination run wild.And I’d be remiss not to mention the language. Suited to its task. Occasionally it seems almost to take flight, but when it does, it seems more appropriate for a glossy travel magazine. And it almost always tries to take flight in just such a milieu: Bhutan, the Alhambra.Most people think that this 720 page novel is too long. Way too long. But imagine what it would be were it the size of most all contemporary novels, 250-350 pages, more or less. Half or less what it is now. What would it be? Even more obviously the ridiculous cartoon that it is. The length is intrinsic to this work. It is long, patiently and meticulously plotted. The very length is part and parcel of its purpose. The reader made to suffer, one with the gears of the plot. That’s the whole point.The leitmotif is sorrow. Everyone is always saying “I’m sorry.” Over and over and over and over again. Of course, thus sorrow loses all meaning, becomes trite. But meanwhile the author is carefully and meticulously adhering to the through line, everyone will suffer, every character, the reader. It’s nothing but melodramatic manipulation.So what is this after I’ve rambled on about what it isn’t? I think it’s a masterpiece of a new kind, joining closely related genres such as mommy porn and the venerable bodice rippers: this is authorial sadism. The author is a “literary” (if you can dignify her as such) dominatrix. Every character set up to fail, no possibility of redemption, growth. And the person who suffers the most in the end is the reader. Set up to be crushed. Again: that’s the whole point.All of us are the stories we tell. No less the novelist.If you read this book and found it amazing, I’m sorry.If you haven’t read this book, don’t.""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Fuck this book.And it started out so well! The writing is actually gorgeous. I can see why many, many people like this book. Really, Hanya Yanagihara knows how to use language. Unfortunately, the story she told was not worthy of it. The longer I read this book, the more I dreaded reading it, the worse my feelings got as I read, and the more I hated it for existing. Then I read a bunch of interviews by her and hated the book even more.The long and short of it is that this book is nothing but misery porn, on purpose. (Here\'s a Vulture interviewwhere she talks about the inspiration for writing the book to create a book version of ombré cloth, which if you\'re not familiar, by the time you get to the end is pitch black. Yeah, let\'s make art that will stain our souls!!!!!)This book.Nothing in life is positive, there is only human suffering, true connection is impossible, predators will always find and ruin truly good people, everything is evil, the people who love you are not enough to save you, and your happiness will turn to ashes in your mouth. The End.Fuck. This. Book.There is a lot more that I could say about this book but I don\'t think I have enough time or space. Other people have criticized more articulately the implications of the way Yanagihara treats her gay characters, who exist seemingly only to suffer (while paradoxicallyothers have praised it as the great gay novel). She also stated in several other interviews her desire to write a character so broken he couldn\'t be fixed, which she accomplishes in her protagonist Jude. Some have called this a melodrama, and that seems accurate. Everything is over the top, but stated in such bald and beautiful prose that it doesn\'t feel that way at the time. Instead, these larger than life events are made to seem trite and commonplace. Yes, there are bad priests in the Catholic church. Yes, the church covered this up. Do I think it\'s likely that an *entire abbey* (the whole thing!) full of Franciscans (the most peaceable and loving sect in Catholicism) would not only participate in child molestation, but condone it openly? Hell no*. One more ridiculous thing in this book on top of another. If it\'s unlikely and causes Jude lots of pain, just put it in this book!*UPDATE 5/23/24: I am about three condescending comments away from closing my comments on this review altogether, but specifically please stop telling me that systemic abuse exists in the Catholic church, I KNOW IT EXISTS AND IT IS BAD. My point in referencing this is that it was just one more thing on top of everything else ridiculously implausible in this book that is taken way too far, and thus makes any eliciting of emotion impossible for me. I get that people like this book and it\'s their baby or whatever, but my not liking this book in no way harms you, a person who did like it. Stop condescending to me, thanks!The real deal breaker for me was when I paused midway through the novel to readan interviewwhere Yanagihara stated her criticism of psychiatry as a way to treat mental illness. The implication that some people are too broken to help and we should just let them die is so, so harmful, and in no way does it help to eradicate the stigma against mental illness in this country. We should not be telling ""broken"" people it\'s okay to die. We should be telling them they are not alone in their suffering, and help them find ways to cope with their illnesses and traumas. I will admit I checked out of the book then, and it was only a matter of time before I gave up and spoiled myself on the rest of it, so I wouldn\'t have to torture myself mentally any further.Glad I did, because the end of this book is a big rusty nail up the butt.This one from the London Review of Books ismy favorite review of the book I\'ve read so far. Let me quote my favorite part:""He wishes he too could forget, that he too could choose never to consider Caleb again. Always, he wonders why and how he has let four months – four months increasingly distant from him – so affect him, so alter his life. But then, he might as well ask – as he often does – why he has let the first 15 years of his life so dictate the past 28.""The answer, of course, is that it’s Yanagihara’s design. That’s why it’s good to know that Jude is entirely her concoction, not a figure based on testimony by survivors of child rape, clinical case studies or anything empirical. I found Jude an infuriating object of attention, but resisted blaming the victim. I blame the author.A Little Life has received some ecstatic reviews. The most intriguing of these is the novelist Garth Greenwell’s in the Atlantic, which argues that it’s the long-awaited ‘great gay novel’: ‘It engages with aesthetic modes long coded as queer: melodrama, sentimental fiction, grand opera,’ he writes. ‘By violating the canons of current literary taste, by embracing melodrama and exaggeration and sentiment, it can access emotional truths denied more modest means of expression.’ Perhaps I’m in thrall to current literary taste, but the only character in A Little Life who seems possessed of anything like ‘emotional truths’ or a sense of irony, the only supporting player in this elaborately ethnically diverse cast who doesn’t seem like a stereotypical middle-class striver plucked out of 1950s cinema, is JB. He’s temporarily ushered out of the narrative after he says to Jude: ‘You like always being the person who gets to learn everyone else’s secrets, without ever telling us a single fucking thing? … Well, it doesn’t fucking work like that, and we’re all fucking sick of you.’ JB’s also the one hooked on crystal meth. What real person trapped in this novel wouldn’t become a drug addict?I think what makes the most angry about this book is that I do see flashes of brilliance in it. Images I loved, earned emotions. Early on in the novel, one character muses about being a guest in his own life. Another talks about photography in terms that made me stop in my tracks and pause the audiobook just so I think about what she\'d written. Later, the relationship between Jude and his adoptive father and the love his adoptive father has for him made me cry. But all of that doesn\'t matter, when the end result is what we\'re given.What it comes down to the fact that pain was the only point, and I think that is reprehensible.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': ""[1/28/24 update: If you liked this book, great. Glad it works for you. Then, this review clearly isn’t for you. In case you would rather list down in the comments all the reasons you love this book rather than read the review, here’s the main point = booktok and bookstagram spent years recommending this book left and right with no trigger warnings. Let’s not pretend otherwise. Conversations can be made without invalidating other people’s opinions.]I don’t want to read a book written by an able-bodied person on the suffering of a disabled person without the research and nuance. You are allowed to love this book (I don’t though) but don’t close your eyes to the fact that this is an able-bodied person writing about how a gay disabled character “never gets better”…. I don’t like what that says.Everyone keeps saying “books don’t need to have a happy ending” and that’s why people dislike this book. But it’s not the reason? Atleast not for me. This book could have the saddest ending for all I care but what matters to me is how it got there. And reading through a friendship that we didn’t even get to watch grow, was not it.The biggest trigger warnings for this book is self harm, rape, (child molestation, child prostitution), suicide. Check the ending of this review for more. AndI don’t care if you consider trigger warnings as spoilers because keeping someone from experiencing episodes and relapses is more important to me than your “plot twists” and your “enjoyment”. It needs to be said and it needs to be normalized because I don’t want to imagine even one person going through what I went through reading this book, or worse. So I hope that if you’re hyping this book up and someone asks you why it’s so depressing, you can tell them about it’s trigger warnings and keep from openly saying that it’s a “worth it read”. I’m tired of people recommending this problematic book so easily.this book should never be recommended lightly.And should be read by those who are in the healthy headspace to do so.I was wrong to think that this was going to be about friendship, it's not.which was half of the reason I started this, and the full reason why I thought I would still love it despite the endless list of all the most trigger-able content.I thought we were going to see the development of this friendship or at least get to know why their found family was/is as solid as it supposedly was. And we never got to see that.I really don't know why people keep emphasizing it but I'm here to tell you that it isn't and I was gravely disappointed when I realized what this book was really about. Some characters were used as plot points and some where used to make you feel guilty... at worst, they were added for the shock factor.Before I say anything else, if you didn’t already know,the author herself said that she wrote Jude without doing any research and that he came to her “fully formed”. Given that the author isnot1. A disabled person and 2. A gay man bothered me the whole time I was reading this book. If you are going to write about mentally sick disabled gay man, you should at least do research about… well, all of those if you’re going to be writing about highly sensitive topics. Most especially when you pack so many traumatizing things into one book.In another interview she said that the reason that she writes about men is because she thinks that they aren’t as good in expressing their emotions as women. And I don’t know with you but that’s a red flag to me.hmm… so… this was grueling to read and I was extremely triggered the whole time I was reading so there’s that. I read the trigger warnings about this book before reading it but i didn’t realize that it so strongly focused on self-harm and self-destruction as much as it did. As someone who has battled with self-harm, it’s going to be incredibly upsetting and hard to read if you aren’t ready. I know it was for me. No one really emphasized that part when I was going through reviews and I do see why since it could be seen as a “spoiler” but I think we need to stop equating trigger warnings = spoilers. . It keeps people from having to read triggering content, like what happened to me, that could result to relapses. I could feel my mental health going somewhere I didn’t want it to.This book wasn’t for me but I know a lot of people loved it.

A Little Life exists in a nonsensical parallel reality where New York City exists in a constant ahistorical state of now, with no Gulf wars, no 9/11, and no humanitarian or environmental disasters, while the rest of America is stuck in the 1950s, but with full wireless internet access.If a Little Life were not bad enough in itself, the things Yanagihara has said about it make it so much worse. Yanagihara originally said she was only interested in writing about suffering, and that she had not done any research into child sex abuse. Later, she wrote a very condescending piece about 'Upsetting the Reader' as some kind of meaningful pursuit, and after that claimed to be fulfilling some kind of public duty by forcing us to confront the depths of human cruelty.Yanagihara has also said some very unpleasant things with regards to mental health and suicide, which, combined with the very unpleasant messages in the book about consent and victimisation, make the whole project morally dubious.It is very obvious that Jude is a puppet, created by Yanagihara to suffer, and suffer in very specific ways, and to that end the whole story is so contrived and nonsensical that it has no meaning, the only cruelty we learn about is Yanagihara's.The first contrivance is Jude himself, the idea that no one would want to adopt him as a baby makes no sense; he is described as having green eyes, skin that turns bronze in the sun, and straight brown hair, this apparently makes him 'too black' to adopt.Next is the monastery itself, that Jude was left there in the first place, when it was not set up as an orphanage, that he survived past infanthood, given how violent the monks were, that they didn't just call social services to come and take him away since they resented him so much, that an order dedicated to poverty resented the cost of one more mouth to feed, that an order of Franciscans spent no time praying or meditating or doing community outreach (the monastery is written more like a farm, I suspect Yanagihara did no research on that either), that all the monks are brilliant teachers in subjects like mathematics and Greek, that Jude never seems to have any Catholic faith to lose, despite being raised in a Catholic order.The shear incompetence of all the police, doctors, teachers and social workers who come into contact with Jude after he is rescued from Brother Luke is ridiculously contrived as well. Somehow he receives no psychiatric care after Brother Luke or after Dr Traylor, and he has incompetent doctors who don't understand child sex abuse, and who think it is appropriate to lecture a raped child about the need to disclose his STI status to future partners. The state school Jude attends while at the children's home takes enough of an interest in him to move him up four grades and arrange extra classes for him at the local community college, but takes no interest at all when he tries to run away and is beaten so badly he is hospitalised, and no one at the hospital sees the need to get the police involved either.Yanagihara created Jude to suffer in very specific ways, all the 'compensations' of his adult life are there to keep him alive and suffering longer (and really, who has such solipsistically dedicated friends in real life anyway?). At college, Jude meets Andy, a doctor willing to treat him privately and for free, thus avoiding any messy reality spilling in, or Jude being committed for his self-harming behaviour. Also, despite Jude's childhood abuse being filmed and photographed in the age of smartphones and the internet, none of those images reappear in his adult life, and despite being in a same-sex relationship with a Hollywood star, he is never chased by the paparazzi, and never has a reporter digging into his past.Even Jude's relationship with Willem is abusive, Willem is effectively raping Jude (Jude feels like he can't say no to sex, even though Willem is supposed to be his best friend), and it feels like it is only there to drag Jude's torture out to the bitter end.What is all this for, what does any of it mean? It induced an emotional response in me, I was left feeling like I had been passed through a meat grinder after reading it, but with hindsight and reflection, it's meaningless, it is wallowing in meaningless nonsensical suffering for it's own sake, and he tells us nothing about the human condition.""}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'A Little Lifeis a strong contender for the award for themost depressing book I\'ve ever read. I swear I\'m not even exaggerating.At this point, I\'m not certain whether this is a positive or negative review. There\'s no doubt that this book is beautifully-written and contains some of the most raw and honest prose I\'ve ever had the pleasure or misfortune of reading, but it\'s alongvery long character study - over 700 pages of misery, substance abuse, self-harm, sexual and psychological abuse (and its aftermath), with very little of that ""light"" promised in the blurb.There\'s a section of this book called ""The Happy Years"" and never has a title been more misleading, if you ask me. But let me give you some idea what this book is about first. It starts with four young friends moving to New York - poor and uncertain of themselves - and trying to make their way. The characterization of JB, Malcolm, Willem and Jude is, to put it plainly, marvelous.They are such complex, well-crafted individuals with their own passions, hopes and fears.While the book details the lives of all four of them, Jude finds himself at the centre of this story, influencing the lives of his three friends. The more you read ofA Little Life, the more you realize that it is really a novel about Jude, and the other three characters - though important - are secondary to the story of Jude\'s journey from a childhood full of sexual abuse to an unhappy adulthood.Those promised ""The Happy Years"" are some of the most heartbreaking chapters I\'ve ever read. I readanother reviewwhere the person said she had to put the book down because this part of the book was too close and personal. To quote the reviewer:I feel like someone shoved their hand in my torso and started stroking my organs while a therapist sits there observing and then asks me, ""now, how does that make you feel?""I know what she means. It\'s brutally, painfully honest. It makes you feel like you\'re witnessing something you shouldn\'t be in the relationship between Willem and Jude. And, by the way, it is one of the most interesting, strange and truly depressing relationships I\'ve ever encountered. The fear Jude feels that this relationship will be pulled apart by his own problems is palpable, and the lengths he goes to in order to conceal his issues made me so sad for him.But I can foresee the future onslaught of negative reviews that call this book ""torture porn"". It is so helplessly bleak. Everything bad that can possibly happen to Jude seems to happen and even when he finds someone to love him in his ""happy years"", that too is tainted by his past.Also, I find that very few books actually need to have this many pages. Almost all books over 600 pages seem too long to me, with many scenes feeling like they weren\'t needed and should be cut out. While I appreciated the depth of the character development, I\'m certain that at least 100 pages of this book could have been shed without losing any emotional punch. Some of the character development felt dragged out way too long; one instance that comes to mind is the descriptions of JB\'s art - from his time building models out of hair, to his paintings - I feel like my understanding of JB and his relationship with art could have been achieved in far fewer pages.This is one of those books that brings a whole lot of genius to the table but very little real enjoyment. It\'s long, slow in parts, and very VERY depressing. But if you are not put off by the length and the dark subject matter, I would say it\'s the kind of book that needs to be read. It\'s the kind of book people will talk about and it\'s the kind of book that has you saying ""this is the most ________ book/relationship/characterization I have ever read"".And that really is kind of amazing.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""I slept with this book after I read it. I kid you not: I held its bulking, hardcover bound 700 pages in my arms as I fell asleep amid a raging storm. I refused to letA Little Lifeleave me. Its brilliant writing, its broken characters, and its bleak, unforgiving story dug into my heart, into the very pores of my skin. As a twenty-year-old, I felt both so young and so old upon finishing this novel, as if its sheer humanity aged my soul while making me appreciate all the years I still have left.A Little Lifefollows four friends after they graduate from a small, prestigious Massachusetts college: Willem, a kind and talented actor; JB, a sharp and sometimes-caustic artist, Malcolm, an aspiring architect at a well-known firm; and Jude, a mysterious and intelligent litigator. What looks like an average bildungsroman turns into an intense and tragic tale when we learn about enigmatic Jude's backstory. Abandoned at a monastery at birth, he endured a childhood of severe physical and emotional abuse, followed by several years of sexual abuse, forced prostitution, and psychological trauma. The book soon hones in on Jude's struggle to free himself from the demons of his past, the hyenas that howl and drown out the voices of his closest, most beloved friends.This book is relentlessly sad and exquisitely written. Hanya Yanagihara spares us no mercy when revealing Jude's trauma. She details both his past abuse and his present self-harm with explicit specificity, her diction so precise and piercing it made me shake, and at times, sob. Yanagihara writes both Jude's suffering and his friendships with a keen eye. She captures the nuances of human emotion, physical space, and change over time with eloquence and heart. She writes about some of the most wretched, abominable acts of cruelty I have ever read without sentimentalizing any of the abuse or making any of the characters' feelings mawkish.Yanagihara offers us temporary respite from the pain within Jude's past by showing us the power of friendship.A Little Life's most affective moments come not from its graphic depictions of violence, but from its quiet, uplifting portrayals of compassion. While the many abusive men in Jude's earlier life show us the depth of human atrocity, Jude's tender, bittersweet relationships with Willem, Harold, Andy, and others offer to us mankind's capacity for kindness. All of these complex characters make mistakes, and through their imperfections shines their humanness.Please keep in mind:A Little Lifeis ruthlessly depressing. In the end, Jude really receives no reprieve from his anguish. As someone who has suffered his own abuse - a version less intense than Jude's, yet still real - and as someone who reads a lot about abuse, I appreciated Yanagihara's dedication to showing the darker side of reality. Trauma is trauma is trauma. And while we can all fight for recovery, sometimes that absolvement may never come. Sometimes, we just have to act with whatever kindness we have left and hope that it brings even a moment of light into the dark.Highly recommended to anyone who wants their heart both filled and destroyed. Set aside some quality time forA Little Life. It will consume you.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'It may sound presumptuous to say in January that I\'ve read the best book I\'ve read all year, but reading is a lot like love. Sometimes you just know.A LITTLE LIFE is a title with 3 meanings. First, it refers to its protagonist, Jude, a man who cannot ever accept that his life is worthwhile. Second, it refers to the act of reading it, spending time in this book is really like living a version of life.There is a third meaning, one that you don\'t discover until around halfway through the book when the title\'s words are used in a context that is like a punch to the gut. When you read them you may find yourself having a physical reaction, your stomach may flip, your skin may go cold, you may gasp for breath. And that is a lot of what the experience of reading this book is like. You can call these parts of the book words like ""awful,"" but to be real you\'d need to pull out your thesaurus and just line them up one after the other. This is not a book that is easy for your emotions. You care about the people in it, so the pain can really hurt you.You will hear that this is a book about 4 friends. It\'s not. They\'re a nice framing device, but this is a book about one person and the people who are connected to him. His life is made up of extremes. I found myself weeping over and over again because of the love and compassion and kindness that characters in the book displayed. But this book has some of the most harrowing and horrifying scenes I\'ve read anywhere. It is not really spoiling anything to say this involves terrible things happening to a child. Everyone knows from the very beginning that something bad happened to Jude when he was young. It\'s just so much worse than you could imagine. (If you have trouble reading about child abuse, it\'s probably best you not read this book. While it\'s essential to the story, it is not glossed over or referenced vaguely and what is described is truly terrible to contemplate.)Jude is not a new character. The damaged soul whose self-worth never really recovers is present in a lot of modern fiction. Yanagihara\'s trick, I think, is just how willing she is to plumb the depths of his darkness and its effects on those around him. She follows him for decades, observes him in all situations, and is unflinching in her depictions. Her writing is the kind of good that you can miss if you\'re not paying attention. You are so caught up in her story that it\'s easy to miss just how agile and careful the book is. It eases back and forth from character to character, backwards and forwards in time, and it never feels strained.I stayed up for hours to finish this book and then couldn\'t sleep because I couldn\'t let it go. I was overcome by the book and by the loss of finishing it.This is a book about love and what it means and what it can do and it is the humanity of its characters and their love for each other that will stick with me.If it was presumptuous to say this is my favorite book of 2015 since it tries to predict the future, I do feel that I can dig through the past and assert with certainty that this is one of the best books I\'ve ever read.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'Note: I received an ebook copy of this book from the publisher for review consideration.Around page 150 of Hanya Yanagihara’s second novel, A Little Life, which follows four friends from their college years into their fifties, I wrote the following in my notes:I am more excited about Hanya Yanagihara and her work and her career than I have been about any author in a really long time.Around page 200 I wrote this:Is Jude’s suffering perhaps a tad overwrought? It is starting to seem like everything bad happens to him forever. Maybe we should spend some time with one of the other characters.Page 200 Jenny was right, and Page 150 Jenny was — well, hope springs eternal, and maybe Yanagihara’s third book will be back up to the standard of The People in the Trees. But as for A Little Life, describing Jude’s suffering as “a tad overwrought” is like describing Dolores Umbridge as “a tad unpleasant.” Yanagihara employs a plot strategy of which I was very fond when I was eleven, which was to think of as many dreadful fates as I could and heap them upon my protagonist one after another. Then when I ran out of ideas, I killed the protagonist off and wrote heartrending scenes of her friends-and-relations mourning her wretched life and too-early passing. I did this because I was eleven. I am not sure what Yanagihara’s problem is.We learn early on that Jude is physically frail, due to an unspecified injury in his past, and that his family isn’t in the picture. Over the course of seven hundred pages, Yanagihara unfolds a cartoonishly woeful backstory to explain all of this. When you first start to recognize the way Jude’s abusive past is tearing him apart in the present, it’s heartbreaking. After two or three wicked villains have gotten through abusing him just because they’re evil, you start worrying that if the author doesn’t right the ship, you’re going to find yourself in the unenviable position of describing a depiction of child sex abuse as silly in your eventual review.The maddening waste is that Yanagihara’s writing is elegant and evocative, and she’s able — at times — to capture with precision and delicacy the true, messy emotions between her characters. And the kind of story that she’s (I think) trying to tell is a kind of story I want to see more of. I want a story that doesn’t pretend there’s a straight path out of trauma into healing that you travel once and then you reach the end and you and your trauma have no further business to transact. I want a story that places serious value on relationships other than romantic ones. I want a story about loving someone who cannot always see his way clear to continuing to live in this world.Ideally, of course, these stories would reach me unencumbered by several metric tons of lunatic melodrama, and I would not have to use the word dreck in reference to an author I admire.

The exaggerated and gross cruelty. The sadistic hopelessness. That's why.I had such high expectations. And it would have been so easy to meet them. All I longed for while reading this book - and talking myself into picking it up and finishing it - was for the main character to find hope.

Possibly the prose? The setting? Sure as hell not Jude's story right? Sure as hell, not the fact that - spoiler - he literally gets fucked and crippled by countless disgusting and evil men, who make him believe that he is a worthless, ugly, non-deserving piece of trash for his entire life, so that he finally kills himself STILL convinced he is worthless, ugly and non-deserving.What kind of book is this. How far does an author have to go? Why does an author have to get so disgustingly graphic, so horrific?Yes, I admit, there were nice parts. Yes, I enjoyed the writing. Yes I loved the travels and the infinitely rich lifestyle everyone seemed to live, but which also made this book even less credible. Yes, of course, I celebrated Jude's achievements, friendships, his lucky moments. But all his lucky moments, all the love he deserved, all the friends he had, had to be taken from him. And this shattered my awe for and good opinion of this novel.This book was filled to the brim with queer pain, and frankly I'm not here for that.

It's a book that kept me reading long into the night, made me turn each page with vigor and curiosity, gave me chills and shivers over the joys and sorrows of each character, and ultimately left me feeling a bit older and tortured and yet at peace with the deeply complicated nature of humanity.What Hanya Yanagihara does withA Little Lifeis nothing nearly as pretentious as that paragraph above. Somehow in 720 pages, she manages to adequately--better yet, excellently--show and make the reader experiences the lives of these young men. The novel follows four boys who meet at college: Malcolm, JB, Willem, and the central and mysterious figure, Jude. It's truly Jude's tale, but Yanagihara ends up telling each and every one of the boys' stories with ease and genuineness that makes them real.Her prose is clean and honest and revealing of the many emotions that humans experience. It's never explicitly beautiful, not flowery or overwrought with adjectives or descriptors. But it has its own beauty that comes from its ability to convey these feelings, making youfeelevery pain or happiness that Malcolm and JB and Willem and Jude feel.

An über leftist pre-meditated kumba-yah-waaah, plodding so far into the wimper-sphere that it could legitimately be considered an ironic harbinger of the kind of paternalistic elitism, against which middle America arose in vengeance, delivering us the worst leader in U.S. history.In this [Vulture piece] the author discussed how she was inspired to create a novel of ombré cloth. If you don\'t know, an ombré cloth is one that by the time you get to the end ispitch black. As Goodreads member Ashley says in her review, ""Yeah, let\'s make art that will stain our souls!!!""If I was writing this review as some sort of literary quasi-critic, I might give the book 3 stars for capable writing and full development of characters, as it thoroughly explores the devastating, lifelong impact of child abuse on the abused. According to Picasso said, ""art is the lie that enables us to realize the truth."" Unfortunately, the author\'s intentions were less than admirable in writingA Little Life.Whoever is looking for a book for enjoyment or edification: the ordeal in reading this was way more than I could bear. It is the saddest and gloomiest I\'ve ever read. A doctor who\'s read this book would have to strongly advise a patient suffering clinical depression to avoid the misery of reading it... at all costs.Understandably then--I think--when I found out that Ms. Yanagihara meant to toy with the emotions of everyone who read this, that she set out to write it in a way that would depress, oppress and dishearten unsuspecting readers, I was pissed. Would I go view a film if I knew the screenwriter\'s purpose was to inflict gratuitous pain and anguish? NO. This is different than emotions like cheer, fear, and sneers at irony. I know a horror movie\'s purpose is to scare, The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Apatow rom-coms are intended to cheer me, and movies like Gladiator and Braveheart to evoke and satiate my inner urge for justice and vengeance. I could think of novels if I had more time.Understand me when I say that I have nothing against books that are sad, if such sadness is organic to the story, Lord knows I\'ve read enough of them and they make me upset sometimes. Many I\'ve rated 5 stars. What I am referencing isintentional manipulation of emotions to compose the story tomanufacture pain. I like how Philip Roth explained the difference: “Everybody else is working to change, persuade, tempt and control them. The best readers come to fiction to be free of all that noise.Such deliberate machinations violate the implicit compact between readers and authors: for the former to keep an open mind and suspend disbelief in reading the novel, and for the latter to write a story as truthfully as possible, which means not deceptively attempting to manipulate the reader\'s emotions. To write the story with its fictive facts in a way that is honest, veridical, organic. Sure, the writer can sway with subtext and mood and motifs. Yet, I don\'t recall a writer, as did this one, who admits that her purpose in writing this book was to make the reader feel as awful and as sad as possible.Faulkner, no writer of uplifting books himself, said ""the writer\'s privilege"" is ""to help man endure by lifting his heart."" To be sure, I\'ve read plenty of sad novels (including some of my favorites); most of the great ones are, in one way or another, depressing. And yet, when I look back I can find something spiritually uplifting in each.Nothingin this novel lifted my heart.For these reasons, I\'m giving the novel 1 star. I only wish I had the option of zero.Also see: review from The London Review of Books [Review]:""He wishes he too could forget, that he too could choose never to consider Caleb again. Always, he wonders why and how he has let four months – four months increasingly distant from him – so affect him, so alter his life. But then, he might as well ask – as he often does – why he has let the first 15 years of his life so dictate the past 28.""The answer, of course, is that it’s Yanagihara’s design. That’s why it’s good to know that Jude is entirely her concoction, not a figure based on testimony by survivors of child rape, clinical case studies or anything empirical. I found Jude an infuriating object of attention, but resisted blaming the victim.I blame the author.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Where to even begin reviewing this book?

It\'s selfish and down right narcissistic. It meant these ""friends"" consistently saw their friend struggling andnever reach out or intervene.Even worse,Jude\'s \'suffering in silence\' is glorified.This deals with extremely sensitive topics (this entire book is a trigger warning) such as rape, chronic pain, self harm, and suicide. It\'s obvious from the first chapter that Jude is suffering and his mental health continues to deteriorate-- but he never asks for help and his friends never intervene. In fact, those who reach out or \'complain\' are seen by the main characters as \'whiny\' or \'crazy.\'This establishes the extremely harmful narrative that asking for help makes you an annoyance.It\'s not accurate. It\'s not how friendship works. There\'s nothing noble about suffering alone. Friends support each other and if you need helpit\'s okay to ask for it.Beyond that, it\'s not even particularly well written.

It\'s not just incredibly misguided it\'sactually incredibly damaging.In summary:this is a book where the main character is applauded for suffering quietly.

It\'s full of pain, desperation, and a sense of isolating sadness that sucks the reader into some very dark places. It\'s also the best book I\'ve read in years.Reading the blurb, you\'ll get the idea that this work is about 4 college friends and their lives, but that\'s not entirely true. While each of the 4 main characters, and in fact all the characters in the book, are fully realized with extraordinary character development, the book is really about just one man, Jude St. Francis.Jude is a truly broken person; he\'s been broken by a childhood that is both a series of horrors that are difficult to read about and a testament to what a human being can endure. Jude doesn\'t come out of his childhood whole and I feel a little broken by having read about his life. I also feel that strange happiness that comes from being emotionally purged in the way that only great books can accomplish.As Alona mentioned in herreview, this is not a romance, but it is a love story. It\'s a love story about friendship that tries to overcome pain, and the bravery and sacrifice that true friendship and love sometimes require. The romance in this book is a beautiful one, but not in the traditional sense that a reader might expect or want for the characters involved.We all often say that we loved this character or that character in one of the many books that we read, I know I say it often, but the character of Jude St. Francis is something special. I loved Jude more than I\'ve loved any character before; that\'s probably why he was capable of so thoroughly breaking my heart. I wanted so much for him, I wanted him to be so much and get so much in life. He didn\'t get all that I wanted for him, but in the end, I was satisfied with where he ended up and it seemed fitting and very real.I hate the term ""triggers"", but it\'s appropriate here. I have a few triggers of my own and they were part of this book, but I felt the writing here just brought me into those places that I don\'t like to go and left me, not upset or feeling traumatized, but more appreciative of my own ability to survive and thrive. I wanted to reach into the book and take Jude\'s hand and tell him we\'d get through it together.This book is definitely not for everyone, but if you\'re up to it, you\'ll be thrilled by the writing.

With its tumbling ivy and overgrown garden, the cottage is worlds away from the abusive partner who tormented Kate. But she begins to suspect that her great aunt had a secret. One that lurks in the bones of the cottage, hidden ever since the witch-hunts of the 17th century.1619: Altha is awaiting trial for the murder of a local farmer who was stampeded to death by his herd. As a girl, Altha’s mother taught her their magic, a kind not rooted in spell casting but in a deep knowledge of the natural world. But unusual women have always been deemed dangerous, and as the evidence for witchcraft is set out against Altha, she knows it will take all of her powers to maintain her freedom.1942: As World War II rages, Violet is trapped in her family's grand, crumbling estate. Straitjacketed by societal convention, she longs for the robust education her brother receives––and for her mother, long deceased, who was rumored to have gone mad before her death. The only traces Violet has of her are a locket bearing the initial W and the word weyward scratched into the baseboard of her bedroom.Weaving together the stories of three extraordinary women across five centuries, Emilia Hart's Weyward is an enthralling novel of female resilience and the transformative power of the natural world.","[{'rating': 2, 'content': 'Three women in different time periods who like nature are treated horribly by men. That\'s it, that\'s the book.Look, I\'m sorry, I just did not have a good time reading this book. I actually wanted to put it down due to the high volume of confronting content and my own discomfort with it. I was also just not engaged with the characters and frankly, bored. I was somehow both confronted and bored. However I was gifted such a beautiful advance copy, I speed read the second half just so I could form an overall impression.I\'ve learned that in contemporary fiction, if something is described as ""hopeful"", it is 98% incredibly miserable, with a tiny bit of ""hope"" thrown in at the end so you don\'t jump off a bridge afterwards. Apparently, same goes for ""empowering"".This book contains a lot of triggering and hard to read content. I read a review that warned you to ""check content warnings"". Where?? Where are these magical content warnings?? Why would you say that and then not supply the actual warnings??Well, here you go: this book contains a lot of r*pe and sexual assault (including of a teenager), domestic violence, pregnancy (including unwanted), pregnancy loss, miscarriage, abortion, stillbirth, and just general male abuse and subjugation of women. Like, a LOT of these things. Also some suicidal ideation and almost attempt. Don\'t let the pretty cover fool you.I just couldn\'t find any useful commentary or message in here to justify an entire book\'s worth of discomfort for me. I already know that men have been awful to women for a long time. I just don\'t get why I\'d want to read about that. And yet somehow I also never felt particularly engaged with the characters.The magical realism to me really defeated any ""empowering"" undertone because I just kept thinking - all this stuff really happens but to people who can\'t control birds and insects so... it kind of felt like the whole idea of the empowering vengeance and freedom was just a fairytale. Real abused women don\'t get saved and protected by magical elements. So there\'s nothing empowering about that for me.I also felt like there was a real focus on a woman being someone with a womb who can continue a family line. The bit at the end with Altha and Adam made me really uncomfortable.Overall this book just didn\'t gel for me and I couldn\'t get past the ick feelings I felt from a lot of the content. A lot of people seem to rate this book very highly so I guess it has worked for others.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""Sublime - a beautiful exploration of three women and their deep connection to the natural world and each other.This is a story of strong, unconventional women who discover their power waging their same-but-different battles against the patriarchy (different centuries, same old shit). There are beautiful elements of magic here for those who like that, but they won't be' off-putting for those who don't (these are green witches, not Halloween witches - there are no spells, cauldrons, or black hats). The author beautifully captured the magic of the natural world, and the way it heals, sustains, and gives life.I was surprised to learn that this is the author's debut - the story is so layered and nuanced, and written with a confident hand. The book is well-crafted, with beautiful writing, intricate characters, vivid imagery and symbolism, lovely pacing, and three equally-compelling storylines that unfold and interweave seamlessly. The womens' discoveries of their individual and shared gifts is well done, and each woman's behavior and choices are logical and appropriate for her time, place, and historical context. A triple narrative and triple timeline can be tricky as one character's story is generally more interesting or more thoroughly developed than the others, but there is no weak link here - all three characters and storylines equally compelling.Thank you to NetGalley and St. Maritn's Press for this ARC.""}, {'rating': 5, 'content': '4.5⭐In 2019, twenty-nine-year-old Kate Ayres flees London to escape an abusive relationship and finds sanctuary in Weyward Cottage, Crows Beck, Cumbria – a property left for her by her late Aunt Violet. As she embarks on rebuilding her life, her curiosity about the property prompts her to research her family history. As she learns more about her incredible legacy and the women who came before her, not only does Kate begin to see herself in a new light but also understands that she too possesses the power to take control of her life just like her ancestors.In 1942, sixteen-year-old Violet Ayres leads a suffocating life in her home at Orton Hall where lives with her father and younger brother. She does not know much about her late mother except for what she overhears in hushed conversations among the household staff. She dreams of becoming a scientist, studying animals and traveling the world. But an unfortunate turn of events finds her cast out of her home, fending for herself alone in a cottage that once belonged to her mother.In 1619, twenty-one-year-old Altha Weyward, a healer with a deep connection to nature just like her late mother Jennet is on trial after the death of a man in her village. Accused of witchcraft and imprisoned in a dark cell, she waits for the verdict which will seal her fate.“I am trying to think of where the beginning is. Who decides where things begin and end? I do not know if time moves in a straight line, or a circle. Here, the years do not pass so much as loop back on themselves: winter becomes spring becomes summer becomes autumn becomes winter again. Sometimes I think that all of time is happening at once. So you could say that this story begins now, as I sit down to write it, or you could say that it began when the first Weyward woman was born, so many moons ago.”Combining elements of women’s fiction, historical fiction and magical realism author Emilia Hart expertly weaves the three different threads of this story into a compelling narrative. The narrative is shared through multiple perspectives. We follow Kate’s story in the present day with separate chapters detailing Violet‘s and Altha’s stories interspersed throughout the novel. Superb characterizations, vivid imagery, atmospheric settings and simple yet elegant writing make for an immersive reading experience. The narrative has strong feminine overtones and though several (not all) of the male characters are unlikable, the author does not indulge in verbose male-bashing or farfetched revenge drama but instead weaves a narrative highlighting the personal growth and resilience of these women and the comfort and strength they harness from their deep connection to nature, that sees them through the adversity they face in their lives. It is sad that despite living centuries apart each of these women had to endure instances of neglect, abuse and oppression. The symbolism of Weyward cottage and how it continues to be a safe haven and a source of strength for the Weyward women through the centuries is particularly significant. This is a story about family, legacy and courage.Emilia Hart’s Weywardis an impressive debut that I would not hesitate to recommend. I also must mention that the cover art for this novel is absolutely stunning.Many thanks to author Emilia Hart, St. Martin’s Press and NetGalley for the much-appreciated digital review copy. All opinions expressed in this review are my own.“Witch. The word slithers from the mouth like a serpent, drips from the tongue as thick and black as tar. We never thought of ourselves as witches, my mother and I. For this was a word invented by men, a word that brings power to those who speak it, not those it describes. A word that builds gallows and pyres, turns breathing women into corpses.”'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""“We never thought of ourselves as witches, my mother and I. For this was a word invented by men, a word that brings power to those that speak it, not those that it describes. A word that builds gallows and pyres, turns breathing women into corpses.”I went back and forth on reading this for ages and I read a LOT of very different reviews. Everything from it being super original (I don’t think so) to being super boring (I have to disagree), from it being anti-abortionis it? I’d argue it’s against unsafe self-induced abortion which is itself a pro-choice argumentto all the men being horrid abusers (#NotAllMen).Because of this, I went into it unsure what to expect. And I ended up really liking it.I definitely wouldn't rush to say this is an original tale-- it's pretty heavy on the tropes. Three different generations of women-- Altha from the 1600s accused of witchcraft, Violet from the 1940s struggling with what is perceived as the correct way to be a woman, and Kate from the present running away from an abusive boyfriend --deal with various shit from various men, but discover their inner strength through connecting with one another and with nature.So, not particularly original but I guess I have a soft spot for a witch (or two or three or four) fighting against the patriarchy.It's a pretty dark tale about generational trauma, and those sensitive to depictions of domestic abuse, rape and abortion should be aware thatWeywardgets quite graphic at times. Personally, I thought the balance was pretty good. Very dark and awful, yet imbued with a positive message about female power.I understand the complaints about all the misogyny these women have to endure, but it was that, for me, that made the climax of the book so satisfying. It is true that the book is mostly compelling because of all the shitty men and the awful things they do or attempt to do to women, but, hell, do I enjoy seeing an abusive dickwad get his comeuppance!What can I say? I had fun.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Weyward is used in the First Folio edition of Macbeth.

This particular book encapsulates many genres other than magical realism, we have some women's fiction and of course the historical side. What I found most fascinating was Emilia Hart's ability to set scenery, her way of describing sights, sounds and smells was visceral and I could easily picture all three ladies' lives in my mind's eye.I loved having three strong female leads to read about and cheer on I cared about them and wanted good things to happen to them.

Kate lives in the modern era, desperate to escape her abusive partner. Violet lives in the 20th century, with a cold father who keeps their deceased mother a mystery from his children. The 3rd women is Altha, she’s a local healer who is on trial for witchcraft after a man was found trampled by cows. These women are separated by time but not by blood, and all of them face the worst possible realities that their respective society can provide.This book is touted as a female empowering/female resilience type story, but all it really does is put female characters into graphic situations (note: there aremany trigger warningsfor this book including but not limited to graphic rape, abuse, abortion, deadly injury, persecution, and humiliation/forced nakedness. Then the woman characters deal with that trauma all alone -ahem, not alone, they have their ancestors’ spirits with them- and only one of them ends up with someone by their side in the end…There are a lot of female characters in this book, and out of all of them, only a single one wasn’t brutalized, raped, or otherwise ostracized by a male character. The ending, which was written as though it was empowering, instead felt incredibly sad. Is it really the legacy of the line of these magical women to be tormented by the world of men, forever? Is it really the legacy of the men who encounter them to be, at best, a “kind man, but still, a man,”? Does our world really need books like these, where the primary force of “female empowerment” is a connection to nature that only occurs in magical realism?

But we learned to wear the name with pride""I did not expect to be taken back by this book as much as I was, towards the end I did let out a few tears. There\'s something about powerful women in this context that pulls at my heartstrings. I love the idea that the past women from your family are with you, and grant you strength. I choose to believe in that wholeheartedly and this story perfectly embodied that.The entire time I was reading this, \'Can\'t Catch Me Now,\' by Olivia Rodrigo was just playing on a loop in the back of my mind (such a good song).

This was so masterfully done - there was high stakes in each of the POV\'s, so I wasn\'t dreading any of them or wanting to skim past anything. The main themes revolve around empowering women, and learning to embrace their own nature - not what amandictates for them.As a thriller/mystery girl, I wasn\'t sure I\'d enjoy the narrative of this because I felt like it would be more of a recount, but I assure you I was flipping through the pages. 𓍢ִ໋🌷͙֒જ⁀➴ Characters:I think all the characters were well written. I was sort of expecting all the characters to have the same personality in this kind of world - but they are all different and express their \'wild\' nature differently.Althais caring, yet bold. She was such a sweetheart in this.Violet, also bold - but her tendency for justice and her willpower shone through a tad more.Katewas my favourite. Which on reflection is an odd choice. I just connected with her more as a character, and her chapters are the ones that tugged tears from my eyes (for all the right reasons).જ⁀➴ World/Setting:I could picture the world beautifully. The descriptions of nature in this are amazing. I thought of forest fairies and living in giant mushrooms type vibe.જ⁀➴ Pacing:My only complaint with this - is around 60% I did feel a tiny bit like nothing was happening, a bit too much filler.

In some ways, it's almost like a retread of Practical Magic…but much less fun.Maybe I should have anticipated the content in this based on the synopsis, but I really did not expect the endless amount of abuse featured here. Every single storyline in this involves physical, sexual, and psychological abuse of women at the hands of men. On top of that, the three women featured are fairly isolated and have very little support, and most of the male characters are vile and controlling abusers with no nuance. The suspense around the climax of this novel is built upon the question of women's safety at the hands of their abusers, which is just something I did not enjoy.It seems like Weyward was maybe trying to fit in amongst the canon of female rage or revenge stories, but there's just something that's missing. This doesn't provide the catharsis that I want from a female revenge story, as there's too much time spent on women being brutalized. The justice is fleeting and the solution to being unsafe is being alone.Something that is not mentioned at all in the synopsis is the focus this novel puts on pregnancy. Every storyline revolves around pregnancy. If I had known that, I probably would have not picked this up. This may be a plot point that really connects with some readers, but I am just not interested in reading a book that is so devoted to examining pregnancy. It felt like womanhood was inherently tied to the ability and desire to have a children (and not just children but specifically daughters who will then go on to have more daughters), and I just have a lot of complicated feelings about that. I wish the synopsis of the book had mentioned this, instead of pregnancy being a surprise twist in every timeline.However, the thing that really sealed the deal on this being an unenjoyable reading experience is that it's just straight up boring. Even though I didn't love reading about all the harrowing things happening to these female characters, it didn't really affect me much emotionally because the writing just isn't strong enough. The characters are pretty flat and lacking in distinct personality. There aren't any worthwhile relationships to grasp onto, and the setting is never described in a way that is particularly enticing. It's all just aggressively mediocre.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '""Weyward"" by Emilia Hart is a mix of Historical & Women\'s Fiction with touches of Magical Realism!In 2019, twenty-nine-year-old Kate Ayres escapes a physically and emotionally abusive relationship in London for Weyward Cottage. This rundown cottage, with its tangled gardens, was inherited from her Great Aunt Violet, who she barely remembers. Struggling with memories of her past, Kate soon discovers secrets Violet has kept hidden dating as far back as 1619 and the witch trials of the 17th century.In 1619, twenty-one-year-old Altha Weyward remembers being taught the knowledge of the natural world by her mother. Women who are different are presumed dangerous and she finds herself accused of witchcraft and awaiting trial for the murder of a local farmer. She knows it will take all her knowledge and powers to sustain her freedom.In 1942, sixteen-year-old Violet Ayres feels trapped, and longs for the education and freedom her brother Graham is allowed. She craves more detail about her mother who died years ago. All she possesses of her mother is a locket with the initial ""W"" and the word ""Weyward"" scratched into the baseboard in her bedroom.Three timelines of three Weyward women with similar stories, living in three different centuries and bound together by their innate connection to the natural world.This was a slow starter for me with simplistic writing and alternating chapters that initially hampered my introduction to the three main characters. However, the farther I read, the depth to the story continued to build and before I knew it I couldn\'t put it down.I found each of the three women\'s stories equally compelling and mysterious, becoming fully invested in each of them. The short chapters were a plus for story\'s pace, and I enjoyed how just enough of a carrot was offered at the end of each chapter to lure you on to the next.I believe Weyward Cottage to have special importance to this story. It provided shelter and refuge, a garden for nourishment, plants for medicinal purposes, and was surrounded by nature and wild life. The cottage felt like it was ""living and breathing"" from generation to generation and representative of another character in the story.This story came together so beautifully and I buzzed through the last part because I couldn\'t wait to see how it played out. There was one characters that was in need of more development but it wasn\'t one of the main characters, and I felt the \'love and magic of nature\' in the story over-shadowed any writing flaws.This author has such potential and I\'m excited for her! I hope she stays with this genre, but regardless of the direction she takes, I look forward to her next offering!

Loved all three. If I had one request, then I would like to have spent more time in Altha’s story that involved witchcraft because I am intrigued with an older timeframe and all this period had to offer.Main Characters ⭐⭐⭐⭐ The character development was wonderful and the strongest element of the book. I felt fully invested in the three female characters which is sometimes difficult to achieve in a novel of this nature.Writing Style ⭐⭐⭐⭐ simple, easy to read, captivating, atmospheric, haunting, suspenseful, and theatrical. What more could you ask for.In all a chilling, mysterious and atmospheric book that you would not regret adding to your list.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""DNF at 18%. I'm really not feeling it sadly :/""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': 'Weyward"" is a hauntingly beautiful debut novel that intertwines the lives of three remarkable women, spanning across centuries, all connected by their shared resilience and a deep bond with nature. Set in three distinct timelines—1619, 1942, and 2019—the novel explores the trials, sacrifices, and strength of Altha, Violet, and Kate, each navigating a world that seeks to suppress their inherent power.The story opens in 2019 with Kate, a woman escaping an abusive relationship, seeking solace in the inherited Weyward Cottage. As she rebuilds her life, she uncovers her ancestors’ hidden legacies. Violet’s story in 1942 transports us to a war-torn world where societal expectations suffocate her dreams, while Altha, in 1619, faces the perilous accusations of witchcraft during the era of witch hunts. Despite the centuries between them, their experiences echo one another, unified by their fight for survival and self-discovery.Hart’s storytelling is both atmospheric and poetic, drawing the reader into each timeline with vivid, sensory-rich descriptions. The detailed portrayal of Weyward Cottage, a sanctuary for these women, adds layers of symbolism, representing both physical refuge and spiritual empowerment. The novel’s pacing builds gradually, allowing for deep emotional investment in each character’s journey, making the moments of revelation and tension all the more impactful.What stands out most in Weyward is its subtle yet powerful commentary on womanhood and the cyclical nature of oppression and resilience. The novel highlights how women, across generations, are often forced to reclaim their identity and power in the face of patriarchal forces. Hart skillfully contrasts the societal constraints of each era while underscoring the timeless strength these women inherit from their ancestors.Though all three timelines are captivating, there is a particular magic in Altha’s storyline, set in the dark and dangerous world of 17th-century witch hunts. Her connection to the natural world, passed down from her mother, offers a poignant meditation on how knowledge, when misunderstood, can be feared and vilified.Weyward is not just a story about witches or magic—it’s about the enduring power of family, legacy, and the invisible ties that bind generations of women together. It’s a compelling, emotionally charged novel that celebrates feminine resilience, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a richly layered, immersive tale that resonates long after the final page is turned.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': ""Not your average Witch story...What an exquisite novel that expertly weaves a blended genre story that leaves the reader wondering how all the puzzle pieces fit.

All the thoughts and opinions are my own.Read more of my reviews atwww.openbookposts.com""}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'An interesting premise letdown by a cliched plot and an on the nose symbolism that rams in its metaphors rather just telling a good story.First of all let me clarify by explaining that this book is NOT a thriller, it’s more of a blend of historical fiction and women’s fiction.The story is told from three female POVs who are ancestors:- Kate is the modern day narrator who is escaping her abusive partner by hiding in her great-aunt’s house. It’s there she finds clues about her past and the wayward women.- 1925. Violet (also Kate’s great-aunt) who wants to study but is pressurised by her dad into being the docile woman and her life changes when her cousin Frederick arrives and grooms her.- 1600s. Althea. Another weyward ancestor who was tried for witchcraft.Althea’s story was the most suspenseful one, however the reveals were tedious and again the metaphor of a “free” woman as a wild woman was on the nose. The story tries hard to be a feminist story but then the plot is all about pregnancy 🤰 a recurring storyline in all three arcs cause. I mean if women are more than their bodies then please give them a narrative where they can show that and are more than pregnancy 🤰 plot-lines. Cause nothing more exciting happens in our lives (!) It also doesn’t help that writing is dry and bland. Not much suspense and the thread between the women is weak. I mean Kate finding out her ancestors were called Weyward and gasping finding a W on Violet’s grave. Oh. My. God. A W. And look. A W necklace. 🙄. I just couldn’t care less.'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '“Witch…a word invented by men, a word that brings power to those that speak it, not those that it describes. A word that builds gallows and pyres, turns breathing women into corpses.”Weyward follows 3 women, across five centuries. All have a love of the natural world. And “nature” loves them back. Altha, in 1619, is accused of being a witch and is on trial. Violet, a teenager in 1942, is trapped by social conventions and a father worried she’ll turn out like her mother. And finally, Kate in 2019, is a victim of domestic violence who finally gathers the strength to run. And she runs to a cottage bequeathed to her by her great aunt Violet. Multiple storylines are often a gamble. It’s rare that all are equal in strength and engagement. But, I was equally invested in all three. In each case, the woman has been plagued by men who use her. But each also found the strength to make her own way and persevere. I wanted to see each story through to learn its outcome. Hart does a good job of weaving just a bit of magic realism into the narratives so as not to make it veer off into fantasy. Many of the twists were obvious to me in advance, but a few took me by surprise.The writing was beautiful with lush, descriptive scenes. It was easy to picture everything playing out before my eyes.The three narrators each express their character well.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'We get it, Emilia. You hate men.'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'Boże jakie to było fantastyczne'}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Weyward is a novel that follows 3 witches over 3 different timelines. While it's not explicitly categorized as a teen book (at least that I could easily find), it has YA and general fiction elements. The language is straightforward, there are no scary scenes, and it includes very minimal sexual descriptions. However, it's important to note that the novel does contain sensitive themes such as sexual assault, child loss, death, domestic abuse, and animal abuse, which may be triggering for some readers.I found a strong connection with Kate, the most modern of the witches, as her experiences felt the most relatable. Each of the witches' stories was engaging and drew me in.Each of the female main characters has endured a challenging life. At times, I found myself angry at the injustices they faced, particularly from men who opposed their existence. The witches seem to face daily or weekly incidents that threaten their lives. However, Kate, the most modern of the witches, represents a beacon of hope in their struggles.While this book isn't necessarily unique in its timeline or centric topic (abuse of women), it is entertaining and an easy read. My favorite part of the novel wasn't a character, per se; it was the crows. The crows, unique in that they have white feathers, follow and protect each of the 3 witches. This theme of crow-human protection is not entirely original to this book. I recently finished The Hour of Crows, and a similar theme prevailed within that novel as well.Overall, a good read. It is fantasy-lite, perhaps. It has a broader appeal and may not suit true fantasy book readers as much. I've seen reviews that emphasize fantasy readers have been disappointed; however, general fiction and mystery readers might tiptoe into the fantasy realm here without feeling whisked away in a heavily built-up fantasy world.""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': '“Weyward, they called us, when we would not submit, would not bend to their will. But we learned to wear the name with pride.”This was not what I was expecting when I went into this book. I thought this book was going to give me absolute witchy vibes but I was pleasantly suprised. I love how this story was told and the spin on the work ""witch"" it gave.“We never thought of ourselves as witches, my mother and I. For this was a word invented by men, a word that brings power to those who speak it, not those it describes.”I honestly loved this book and the different ways that societal norms and pressures affected women. It also shows us how women were viewed when they did not fit into that tight little box they trapped them in.Weyward follows three women in three different timelines all coming from the Weyward family. The story begins with 1619 and ends in 2019. All three women were faced with challenges and mistreated in one form or another, mostly by society or men who were trying to keep them in a box and have power over them.In 1619, we have Altha Weyward whose mother passed and who is on trial for the murder of a neighbor. She is viewed differently because she is a healer who has a deeper connection to the nature around her.In 1942, we have Violet who is a teenager and wants to break herself from the chains of society. She wants more than the societal norms for women. She wants to be a scientist where she studies animals and travels the world. However, something tragic happens causing her whole world to be turned upside down.In 2019, we have Kate who flees her home to escape an abusive relationship. After her aunt Violet passes leaving Kate her home Kate runs there in hopes to rebuild her life and get answers into her family and who her Aunt Violet really was. In searching for answers she finds out the history and legacy of the Weyward women, and the inner strength she needs to take control over her own life.I would say this book fits into women fiction mixed with historical fiction and some magical realism. The writing was very descriptive and atmospheric and listening to it on audio was absolutely enteraining. I feel this book speaks to the ""wild"" side of every woman. The side of us connected to the nature, that wants to break the ceiling glass that keeps women under certain norms.“I had nature in my heart, she said. Like she did, and her mother before her. There was something about us---the Weyward women---that bonded us more tightly with the natural world. We can feel it, she said, the same way we feel rage, sorrow, or joy.'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'Sometimes, there’s power in a place. Or perhaps, some places help us find our own power.Generations of women in the Weyward-Ayers family have made their home at Weyward Cottage in the remote village of Crows Beck, Cumbria.The first Weyward child is always a girl, each of whom share a common familial gift: the ability to connect and communicate with nature.Emilia Hart’s first novel,Weyward, weaves together three separate stories, spanning multiple generations and eventually linking to tell a larger tale of strength, resilience, and love.Altha is well versed in plant medicine and is tried for practicing witchcraft in 1619.In modern-day London, Kate flees her abusive live-in boyfriend before he can discover that she’s pregnant. Taking refuge in her great-aunt Violet’s cottage, she attempts to rebuild her life and her eroded identity.In 1942, teenaged Violet lives a cloistered life within the confines of her father’s estate at Orton Hall. He finds her unladylike behavior of climbing trees and collecting insects so appalling that he threatens to send her to a finishing school so he can marry her off to an eligible young man.The three women are linked not just by a family tree, but each one has to endure powerful and controlling men. Hart paints a brutal and vivid picture of what each woman experiences at their hands. These scenes of physical, sexual, and emotional abuse are both graphic and uncomfortable.Eventually, each woman must discover and come to terms with her affinity for the natural world and the power she wields.Sounds good, no?And it is, save for the fact that I’ve read it before — hi there,New York Timesbestselling authorAlice Hoffman— over twenty years ago, in fact.As someone who worships at the altar of Alice Hoffman and devours her new releases in one or two sittings, I found Emilia Hart’s debut a.very.slow.read. Painfully so.But hey, look at that book cover. Stunning!Listen,Weywardis an enjoyable tale that explores feminist themes with a hint of magic. At just over 300 pages, give it a read.The way the three stories of women reclaiming their power intertwine and intersect is quite bewitching.»»————-\u3000★\u3000————-««""Perhaps one day, she said, there would be a safer time.

Told through three distinct, brave, resilient women, all victimized, oppressed, and controlled by weak men and subject to their whims and abuse in different ways. The story alternates between Altha, who is on trial for murder in 17th-century British witch trials, and her fate is in the hands of men. In the 1940s, Violet, who her father isolates and controls as she unravels the secret of her mother’s death by mysterious circumstances, and our modern witch Kate, who escapes her controlling, abusive husband who sees Kate as someone to give him a child.My Two CentsIt’s all about female power and resilience but not about female revenge and rage, even though I do love a good female revenge/rage story. We see each woman find strength and power from their connection to their female line and to nature. Emilia Hart gives each woman something unique as they can creepily communicate with nature in a yet powerful way. While even the thought of some brings on some irrational fears, it felt empowering and fitting to the story.The story is well-paced and beautifully written with vivid imagery, with a strong connection between the characters that come together with a rewarding ending.I received a copy from the publisher through NetGalley'}, {'rating': 3, 'content': 'I liked this well enough. Not a glowing endorsement, but there were definitely things I enjoyed. The characters were interesting, the atmosphere was well done, and I felt engaged from the start. I also felt the different POV characters and time periods were balanced nicely, which kept things interesting.However, I think the book\'s themes could have had more impact without the magic element. A significant focus thematically was on the resilience of women throughout history, dealing with a patriarchal society - which is a fantastic theme and one I particularly enjoy reading about - but the impact was dulled by the fact that these women were also powerful witches—key emotional moments often revolved around acts of magic, which shifted the focus from celebrating internal strength to showcasing extraordinary magical powers. It felt like the message was, ""Women with magical powers are strong,"" which wasn\'t as empowering as it could have been, for obvious reasons.Comparing Weyward to something like Hester, which also jumps between time periods and focuses on the internal strength of women, Weyward falls short. Hester deals with strong women being labelled as witches and killed for it but without any actual magic powers, which made it far more impactful for me.Another thing that didn\'t sit well with me was the recurring idea that women\'s strength is tied to our ability to be mothers/our wombs. This isn\'t inclusive of so many women\'s bodies and experiences, and I must say I found it a bit off-putting. As someone who is currently child-free by choice and doesn\'t plan to test the functionality of my uterus anytime soon (or possibly ever), I had conflicting feelings. On the one hand, it\'s great to celebrate motherhood, but on the other, implying that women are strong because of our reproductive abilities feels objectifying and dehumanizing. It\'s important to acknowledge the many women who either can\'t or choose not to give birth, who are just as strong and just as much women as those who are able and chose to become mothers.So, despite enjoying the characters, setting, and atmosphere, I wasn\'t on board with the underlying message that women\'s strength comes from our wombs and felt this was a middle-of-the-road read that can\'t compete with other books I\'ve read that aim to explore similar themes, but do so in a more inclusive way.Watch me review all of the 2023 Goodreads Choice Winners here:https://youtu.be/H8A5Ymec0jYRepresentation: one of the POV characters is a lesbianTrigger/Content Warnings: domestic violence, blood & gore, abuse (emotional, physical, verbal, financial, reproductive, child, child sexual), grooming, incest, corporal punishment, surveillance, alcoholism, fatal car crash, loss of parents, unwanted pregnancy, confinement, suicidal ideation, PTSD, forced medical procedures, abortion, miscarriage, stillbirth, misogyny, religious persecution, animal death, taxidermyYou can find me on...Youtube|Instagram|TikTokYou can join our book club over on Patreon...PBB Book Club'}, {'rating': 5, 'content': 'All those harrowing stars for Weyward by Emilia Hart Narration by Nell Barlow,Aisha Kala & Helen Kelley.This was an atmospheric,harrowing novel that just broke my ❤️ heart it was not easy to listen to as it contained domestic violence to women but had to be told.Kate Ayres runs away from London to Weyward Cottage as she was in an abusive relationship she was 27 years old.1619Althea Weyward was 21 who was being taught the knowledge of the natural world by her mother, you see she was different she was dangerous they think she is practicing witchcraft & awaiting trial for the murder of a farmer John Milburn, she too had been abused by men.164216 year old Violet Ayres feel trapped in her home & want’s the education her brother receives as well as her freedom, so she wan’ts to find out how her mother died years earlier hr brother Graeme is the only family member she has of her mothers memory she finds a locket with the letter W on it was it a sign or something that will take her to find her mother or are secrets being kept hidden that no one wants revealed?This was a harrowing read that I couldn’t put down it was so beautiful each character & their struggles & how they fought above it all the tree timelines 2019 , 1619 & 1942 were all well narrated, I thought the three narrators would confuse the trope but it made it easier to know who was who!! All the stars 🌟.'}, {'rating': 1, 'content': 'I don’t give books one star often, I’m fairly easy to please as a reader and quick to give praise but this book enraged me. Firstly it should come with a trigger warning larger than the title, because this book contains almost all the different ways women can be abused by men and other triggering scenarios - rape (on and off the page), domestic violence of varying aggression, a forced hysterectomy, attempted suicide, self administered abortions, car crashes and neglect/abusive parenting. I’m sure I’ve missed something from the list but basically any way a woman can be treated like dirt is here. The narrative is split between three related women, one in the 1600s, one growing up in the shadow of World War Two and the other in 2019. All of these separate stories have been told before, told by so many writers and given space to breathe, be raw, honest and powerful - and I have loved those books. However crammed together in this book these universal narratives have no meaning, no sense, the characters become caricatures with no weight to them. There are only two men in the book that aren’t villains - one you only see in flashbacks and the other is a bit part mostly seen as a child. The other brutes are atrocious and just as much caricatures as the women - I can’t imagine any man reading this book and seeing any reality in them but it would still seem like an attack to see your gender presented in this way. And to have this book marketed in the way it is - as historical fiction with witchcraft and fantasy elements - is seriously troubling. The fantasy element is merely used to hook readers, to make people buy this toxic and wholly unnecessary book which I am truly thankful I received as an ARC so didn’t waste any money on. The writing qualities of this book are absolutely fine, the author can clearly string a story together- I just wish she’d chosen to write something more well rounded and less biased, something real and tangible, nuanced and thought provoking.'}, {'rating': None, 'content': ""i'm intimidated by historical books. i'm a multi pov hater. and yet...there's something about this one""}, {'rating': 4, 'content': ""Kate has to leave her home for she has a husband who abuses her. She takes off to Weyward Cottage an old home left to her by her great aunt. The cottage offers Kate solace but it also holds secrets of her family that date back to the sixteen hundreds.The author takes us back in time to meet up with Altha a woman living in 1619, as she awaits trial. Altha is accused of causing, through black magic, a herd of cows to trample a local farmer to death. Altha does know the magic of nature taught to her by her mother, but not the evil kind she is being accused of. Of course in those days every woman was thought to be a witch or to be capable of being one, so Altha's fate seemed to be that of many others and death to be her final judgement.Next, we arrive in 1942, where we meet Violet, a woman who wants what she can't have, the freedom and education given to her brother. She lives a life confined until she finds a baseboard in her room with the word Weyward scratched into it. She carries the locket of her deceased mother who it was claimed went mad.This character study into the hearts and souls of these three women living centuries apart, is wonderfully intertwined into a riveting story that points to both magical realism and the hardships these women faced.The men in the story do not come off well as they exert their power over these women and of course others that cross their path. It is a story of how women have struggled to be able to stand side by side with their male counterparts. In its chapters which flip back and forth in Kate, Altha, and Violet's lives, we see a progression of strength, of the nature of women, and the magic they often possess.Wonderfully written (and it's a debut), this is a great look into what was and what continues to be if women do not use the rights that have been theirs for some time.Thank you to Emilia, Hart, narrated by Aysha Kala; Helen Keeley; Nell Barlow who did a fine job, Macmillan Audio and NetGalley for the audio version of this book due out March 7, 2023""}]"
